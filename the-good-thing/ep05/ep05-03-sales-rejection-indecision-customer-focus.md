Jens
Like, you know, in the past, I really feared asking the credit, like, you talk to a big enterprise and
you knew you're too small. Like we're two people. Like they will never buy from us. We knew it,
but we wouldn't ask because we were afraid of losing that opportunity. So we didn't ask. And
today we're like, hey, you.

00:11:22:03 - 00:11:51:01
Jens
Like, I don't know, whatever. We're just very upfront, like, hey, we're we're this and that. Is that a
problem for you. Like, can your company deal with that situation? And, and, they say yes, they
say no. If they say no, you have time for all the other leads. So, yeah. Why waste your time with
an opportunity that that's, you know, do you remember that one company where where one
developer was he he kept pushing us towards?

00:11:51:01 - 00:12:22:11
Jens
Yeah. Building more features so that eventually he could convince management. And we we just
couldn't tell him. Dude, either we speak to the manager now, or we have to assume that we're
not bringing any value to your company, and you're not ready to pay for what we're doing
because it doesn't have the value that you're you're willing to put the credit card, but yeah, you
have to you have to learn this right.

00:12:22:14 - 00:12:37:23
Stefan
And that was a rough time because I think you said up perfectly like just get to the no. This is
even also good. And like just life. Like you see a cute girl, go ask her out. The worst thing she
can say is no or maybe she says yes. Just try to get to know. And you taught me this.

00:12:37:23 - 00:12:44:16
Stefan
Actually, in a sales negotiation, the no is the start of the negotiation. The worst thing you want is.

00:12:44:19 - 00:12:46:12
Jens
Explain to me what's the problem.

00:12:46:15 - 00:12:47:29
Stefan
Exactly? You want to get the.

00:12:48:00 - 00:12:55:13
Jens
You cannot use us? Why? Explain to me what's the problem? Oh, we security. Yeah. We have
soc2 and then.

00:12:55:15 - 00:13:11:18
Stefan
It opens it up. That's the way the negotiations start. The worst thing you want is what we had
with this customer, which was a maybe. Oh, we like your product, but if you add this, maybe I'll
introduce you to my manager. And so for six months we're adding features we're building for this
giant enterprise. They're, they're a fortune something company.

00:13:11:18 - 00:13:27:21
Stefan
They're publicly traded. And it was one guy. And eventually I got to the point where we built
everything and he's like, oh, can you add it on the edge? And we were like, okay, you know
what? Like we how long did it take? I think we worked with him for a whole year building stuff,
and we never got a single dollar from this company on.

00:13:27:23 - 00:13:39:09
Jens
What what's the what's the the big, competitor than your competitor, like, how do you lose most
deals? And it's not the competition. What is it?

00:13:39:11 - 00:13:42:22
Stefan
How do we lose the most deals? I mean.

00:13:42:25 - 00:13:45:05
Jens
I put you on the spot right? Yeah.

00:13:45:05 - 00:13:48:05
Stefan
Well, it depends, like, how do we lose? Sometimes it is to the competitive knowledge.

00:13:48:05 - 00:13:50:15
Jens
You just forgot it's indecision.

00:13:50:17 - 00:13:53:10
Stefan
Oh, yeah, 100%. Especially if it takes too long.

00:13:53:12 - 00:14:18:13
Jens
They come to you somehow. The sales process, it's not working like you want. And then they
are like, we're not moving forward with the project. That's. Yeah. You know, you you fucked it up.
You, you you made a mess. And this typically happens when you when you did not fully
understand what the customer's trying to do.

00:14:18:17 - 00:14:37:08
Jens
Because and this is like I would say, I don't know, I'm not a salesperson, but we, we we have a
little bit of intuition about customer comes to us as we want federation and we say we can do
federation and then we show how awesome we are. And then after a while they say, oh, it's not
the right thing.

00:14:37:10 - 00:14:59:16
Jens
And the problem is customer says we want federation and then stop. Yeah. Take a few steps
back. What are you trying to do? Like what? What problem is this solving. Who is driving this
initiative. Where's the money coming from? Who's making the decisions? Like why are you
here? Why do you join this meeting? Why do you talk to us?

00:14:59:19 - 00:15:17:01
Jens
What? What is important to you? It's not really like is it the hair on fire or is it? Someone is
interested in trying out cool tech? Because you don't want to sell to people who try out cool
tech. You want to. You want to to solve the most important problem in that company. Yeah.
