Stefan
Same thing with if you make $1 million, once you get the first million, you invest a little bit.
Compound interest starts to take into effect. You make some more actions, you purchase some
real estate, and then after that, from the one to the 5 million to the ten, it just exponential growth.
But getting to that first 1 million is really a bitch.

00:22:50:12 - 00:23:28:03
Jens
And maybe one little bit spicy take to add opinions without a credit card are noise. So if you
have a startup idea and you go to your friends, they like you and they will say it's cool, I could
imagine buying it. Whatever, but they are not buying it. And the same as with developers who,
who, who show up on your open source repo and say, oh, it's great, I have an idea how you
could make it better.

00:23:28:06 - 00:23:54:19
Jens
And they're also not buying. They are not a customer. So I think if you want to build a great open
source project, yeah, of course you can listen to to like, I'm, I'm, I love open source, like open
source collaborations. It's great. I love it. But if you want to build a business, you you need to,
you know, it's it's it's a bit like, like, like giving a loan.

00:23:54:19 - 00:24:07:08
Jens
You need to underwrite opinions with money. Opinion without money. Just someone saying
words, not saying agree.

00:24:07:10 - 00:24:26:27
Stefan
I think, though, that only in the context of B2B. So like software and like selling to businesses
because do you think that applies for like let's say Facebook like Facebook didn't charge. And
the first thing that everyone told them was no ads. Who was it in the, The Social Network, I think
it was Edwin Stavros. He was like, you need to start charging for ads.

00:24:27:00 - 00:24:44:01
Stefan
And one of the other founders was like, no, get as many people as you can onto the platform.
Once you do that, you can figure out how to make money. Same thing with Uber. Their biggest
thing was growth. But I think that only applies to B2C. Would you agree?

00:24:44:03 - 00:24:51:21
Jens
I would say I don't understand B2C, but, ask people who do.

00:24:51:23 - 00:25:03:04
Stefan
That's fair. I also have one theory, though. Every successful B2B company eventually becomes
B2C. What do you think about that?

00:25:03:07 - 00:25:16:17
Jens
Every successful B2B company eventually becomes B2C. Yes. Interesting. Is Salesforce B2B.

00:25:16:19 - 00:25:20:01
Stefan
Kind? Salesforce? Yes. But look at them now.

00:25:20:01 - 00:25:21:16
Jens
Is it B2C now?

00:25:21:18 - 00:25:40:11
Stefan
Yes. Now they do for restaurants. They do for personal stuff. They do like this agent force AI and
they went from like typical enterprises to restaurants into smaller mom and pop stores, and
they're spreading their network as farther as they can, like yes technically it is still is B2B, but
they're going now further.

00:25:40:13 - 00:25:44:24
Jens
Is the the TAB to smal whats the issue?

00:25:44:27 - 00:25:58:14
Stefan
Know, I think that's a byproduct of being too successful is eventually like for example, if you're a
B2B company, to get to the utmost success, you eventually become B2C. You start to spread
out to everybody and you start to change things. I just a theory that I have.

00:25:58:16 - 00:26:08:19
Jens
plan?
Interesting. So, in the, in the, in the long term we will federate your mobile phone or what's your

00:26:08:21 - 00:26:36:13
Stefan
Yeah. I haven't thought about that yet. Like, like some theories are like with developer tooling
you should build for the enterprise, but also the individual developer should be able to use your
product. I don't think that's correct. True. Because individual developers don't like to pay for
stuff, which is totally fine. Our product is open source, but for us, what I think is, I mean, we
currently have like the number one, one of the most popular apps on the App Store is using
Wundergraph Cosmos to power it.

00:26:36:16 - 00:26:48:07
Stefan
It's the deal that we. Yeah, yeah, I'll explain to you afterwards. I can't say their name yet
because we don't have, the NDA, but I'll tell you afterwards. Well, the number one app in the
United States, actually, and you're going to like actually doing B2C.

00:26:48:09 - 00:26:50:25
Jens
At least we enable it.

00:26:50:28 - 00:27:04:24
Stefan
Yeah, kind of. But it's an interesting topic. Like, for example, like Salesforce. Yes. Like now
they're going out to B2C. And I'm trying to think of a couple other examples of like really
successful B2B companies.

00:27:04:26 - 00:27:10:23
Jens
So the way you argue is you make a big point and then you don't back it up.

00:27:10:25 - 00:27:30:10
Stefan
No, it's just a theory. Like it's a hypothesis. That's that's my hypothesis. I haven't figured it out
yet though. But yeah, honestly it's a good transition though, so let's go back to some of the
topics that we have today. Like for example, is founder mode scalable versus a founder team,
founding team. And for what it's like founder mode.

00:27:30:16 - 00:27:37:24
Stefan
Are you going to ask me of my definition or what? Like Paul Graham said,
