Stefan
I would agree to that one thing though. One that is indecision is the biggest like killer of deals.
But you also have to walk a fine line. So like right now I'm currently like negotiating with the
vendor to purchase something for wundergraph. And I got them down to the price that I want.
But they said that price is only active until Friday.

00:15:34:13 - 00:15:34:27
Stefan
You like.

00:15:34:27 - 00:15:37:25
Jens
You got them down. So are you buying or they buy?

00:15:37:25 - 00:15:38:27
Stefan
I'm buying, I'm buying.

00:15:39:00 - 00:15:40:12
Jens
You're buying okay. You're buying. Yeah.

00:15:40:18 - 00:15:55:22
Stefan
I don't want to mention the name because if we go with them. But basically they came in, they
were like all this stuff and they were like, oh, like I got the deal down to this price, but it's only
valid till Friday. And like, I get you want to squash the question. You want to squish the in
decisiveness.

00:15:55:24 - 00:16:06:27
Stefan
But there's also a way to do it. I don't like that pressure that that was put on me like, what would
you do there? I know you could talk a little bit about our sales process and how we handle
indecisiveness.

00:16:06:29 - 00:16:17:10
Jens
Yeah. Maybe it's a German or European thing, but if you hold the gun to my head, I would just
run away.

00:16:17:12 - 00:16:20:28
Stefan
It's the same thing. Like.

00:16:21:00 - 00:16:51:13
Jens
Oh, it it doesn't work. And I think the problem is this person fails to understand your motivation,
and they fail to demonstrate the value because you're like, no, no, no, the price needs to come
down and I need time to, to decide if someone needs a lot of time to decide. The value is not
clear, like if you can, if you can pay $1 and you get five, how long will you think about it?

00:16:51:15 - 00:16:52:15
Stefan
I'm not thinking I'm buying.

00:16:52:15 - 00:17:08:28
Jens
Simple, right? But if someone wants to from you like, I don't know, 500 K and you're like, I need
to think about it. Yeah, it's it's not clear how the 500 K will turn into 5 million.

00:17:09:00 - 00:17:31:05
Stefan
I think you just broke down enterprise sales and probably the most clear way I've ever seen.
Like, that's the biggest problem is that vendors are not demonstrating the value. And what you
can do is if you take away all the layers you want to pitch your product, that you give me $1 and
I will bring you $5. And when the value is so clear, whatever it is, it's so easy to make a decision.

00:17:31:06 - 00:17:48:14
Stefan
I think that's the biggest problem is indecisiveness comes because what you're doing is you're
evaluating the value and it's just not there. If you're still taking a long time to decide on it.
Because for me, if I purchase this, I'm putting my name on the line. I'm bringing this into
wundergraph. Same thing when people purchase WunderGraph Cosmo the champion.

00:17:48:20 - 00:18:04:14
Stefan
They're bringing this platform into their organization. Their name is on it. If things go bad, they
say, hey, Jens was the one that brought in Cosmo. That's clearly not doing a good job. Or if it
does go well, man, Jens. This is a fantastic product. Thank you so much for bringing it in. And
so you also have to do the emotional aspect.

00:18:04:14 - 00:18:14:24
Stefan
But I really like how you broke that down. $1 I give you $1 or you give me $1, I give you $5.
That's exactly the way you should pitch value with your product.

00:18:14:27 - 00:18:46:19
Jens
Yeah. Sometimes it's not so easy to see. Like if I adopt GraphQL federation and I pay a dollar
for it, will I get five? What will I get? Collaboration across teams. I will have better microservices.
I have this and that and this is the point where it can help if you have existing customers. So I
think like unfortunately the cheat code to startup success is to have customers.

00:18:46:22 - 00:19:21:21
Jens
That's and yeah, I just watched the documentary and it was about billionaires and the billionaire
said, yeah, I inherited some money and I had to do all this hard work. Yeah, of course, like,
dude, of course you did hard work. And also when you were young, your parents had all these
connections and they gave you this starting money and they helped you to get into circles where
nobody else like, the reality is, if you want to be successful, you need a network.

00:19:21:23 - 00:19:40:26
Jens
And you need, like, ideally, you have customers and you can you can, you can create or you
can derive customer stories, like what problems did you solve for customers? And then you go
to the next prospect and tell them, like, hey, do you have this problem? Do you have this
problem? They say, yes. And then you can you can teach them how.

00:19:40:26 - 00:20:06:26
Jens
That company solve this problem. So now it's actually clear how you get $5 from, from one or
more. And yeah. So it's a code. And because this is the cheat code, you need customers. So
how do you get your first customers? It's simple. Build any whatever build something like your
first startup idea is garbage. Like even if you think it's smart, it's garbage.

00:20:06:28 - 00:20:28:24
Jens
Because what you need is distribution. So build whatever gets distribution, build some sort of
distribution. Five customers talk to them, figure out the pattern like, oh, these five customer.
They have the same pattern. I build a new tool. I sold it and then I have five customers already.
So they pay you. So it's easier to upsell them to something else.

00:20:28:24 - 00:20:50:04
Jens
So you give them this new solution and then you you write a customer success story or you do
a podcast with them, and now you can go to other people and say, hey, we solved this problem
for these five people. So yeah, in retrospect, startup it. It's not so hard just yeah, I think and this
is something for technical founders.

00:20:50:06 - 00:21:08:03
Jens
Don't get hung up on your idea because your idea is garbage. Like even if you're a super smart
like, but your first idea is just whatever. Just just build something, distribute something, get the
customers. Because then you have a playbook of selling something and yeah, so I don't know.

00:21:08:05 - 00:21:27:02
Stefan
It's spot on. YC always say like their motto is build, build things that people want. And one of the
manifest in their manifesto, one of the rules is just have a small group of customers. It's better to
have ten customers that absolutely love your product, then 100 customers that are like, yeah,
it's not bad, it's okay.

00:21:27:04 - 00:21:42:02
Stefan
And the reason that they say that is because what you just said is that once you have a couple
customers that love your product, you start to open up network effects. They'll start to talk to
their friends about this product. Hey man, have you tried I wundergraph cosmos like you're
using Federation. It's fantastic. Try it out.

00:21:42:04 - 00:21:57:08
Stefan
You know this solves all these problems. And the second part is it's so easy to see patterns is
that you have this customer and you're like, oh, that's a use case. And then you talk to another
company like, oh, we actually solve that problem for this customer here. Look at this case study
that they did. And it makes the sale even easier.

00:21:57:08 - 00:22:12:14
Stefan
But then they're like and then in decisiveness and what you do is you take that customer and
you bring them into a call and you just sit back and just watch them talk. And what they do is
that they're selling your product in a non salesy way because they're actually collaborating
together. And that's also one of the benefits.

00:22:12:14 - 00:22:31:28
Stefan
And it's funny that you said billionaires because they all say the same thing like the first million
is a bitch. It's the hardest thing to do. And it's the same thing in startups. It's the hardest to get to
the 1 million ARR mark. It's really hard to get your your first customers that love you, but after
that it just scales up so easily because you have these customers.
