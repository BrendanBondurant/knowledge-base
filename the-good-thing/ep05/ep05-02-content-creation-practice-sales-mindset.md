Jens
Yeah. You know, I, like most people don't care about you. Everybody is busy. Nobody cares
what you're doing. Nobody cares. That wundergraph has a new feature, but people are super
interested in the story, in the struggle, in the how did they get there? How? How did they help
someone go to the Super Bowl with their API? Yeah, it's it's stories.

00:07:40:03 - 00:08:10:15
Jens
And, just one thing I wanted to to pick up before I forget about it. You mentioned just start with
content. And here's the thing. You like one of your friends, David K piano. He said this a while
ago. Everybody can record the video just just record it. Even if it's bad. Just record it, put it on
YouTube and then record the second one and make a third one, and you will hate the first ones,
and eventually they will get better.

00:08:10:15 - 00:08:36:10
Jens
And this is for example, like I'm not so like the, the, the video guy, but with you Stefan, it's it's
okay. But I love to write blog posts. And, when I started like a couple of years ago, it was hard
for me to write, and I, I really didn't like my first blog post. But if you write more than 100 blog
posts, then you can more or less write a blog post in your head.

00:08:36:12 - 00:09:01:21
Jens
And the typing in the end is really just like like, yeah, putting it in paper. The rest is already done
because you, you have created like a structure in your head, how to write blog posts and so
yeah, it's so many skills. If you if you want to get good at something, start with it. You will suck
and then do it again and you will suck again.

00:09:01:21 - 00:09:07:21
Jens
Then do it a couple more times and you will suck less and eventually it will be good.

00:09:07:24 - 00:09:25:12
Stefan
And that's crazy that you bring that up. So like every once in a while, like people see like the
success of like Wunder Graph, like my friends from college and they're like, wow. Like the top
on a call. Like, I want to know what you're doing. Like, what are you doing differently? And I
always tell them the same thing is that in the beginning of the day is a Wunder Graph, like when
we were doing this on the side when, you were working your full time job.

00:09:25:12 - 00:09:44:19
Stefan
I was working my full time job. You told me it's like taking spaghetti and throwing it against the
wall, because you can see when it sticks, that it's ready, that it's good to eat. It's all done. But if
the spaghetti falls, it's not ready. And people over overcomplicate things. If you want to get good
at programing, start typing.

00:09:44:25 - 00:09:58:09
Stefan
If you want to get good at soccer, start kicking the ball around. If you want to get good at
content, just start making videos. And it's exactly what you said is that if you want to start
building a startup, the first thing you have to do is just start. Start something, try everything that
you can, and eventually you get good at it.

00:09:58:09 - 00:10:17:23
Stefan
And it's the same thing with sales. Do you remember our first sales call and then now our any
call that we do? I actually don't even remember it actually. Two. But point is on a sales call, I'm
already seeing stuff that's like, I know what to do. Like I'm already seeing the patterns. I'm
already knowing exactly what to do in it because it comes from actually taking the calls.

00:10:17:23 - 00:10:36:03
Stefan
And for me, I think people overcomplicate it because stop thinking and just do. And I think that's
one of the biggest things that people struggle with is they like are thinking theory, like, oh, how
big is the market? How big is this? How big is that? And it's like, dude, you'll never know if you
don't start. You might create a whole new market if you just would just start the frickin product.

00:10:36:06 - 00:11:02:01
Jens
Yeah. You know what's so funny? In the beginning, when we started with sales, I was always
afraid. Afraid of getting rejected. Today, I want to be rejected. Like I actively pursue being
rejected. Because the very last thing you want to end up is in a situation where you have a
potential customer who will never be a customer.

00:11:02:03 - 00:11:00:09
Jens
Like, you know, in the past, I really feared asking the credit, like, you talk to a big enterprise and
