Jens
You know, Postgres, next.js super boring. The absolute worst boring thing you could imagine, is
our auth. What's the auth thing again? keycloak like the boring, boring, ugly Java thing, but it
works. And it has. It has the device flow. So device flow is very important for the for the cli.

01:07:07:23 - 01:07:25:16
Jens
And you can run it locally like so many auth things. You cannot run them locally. We want it to be
able to run it locally with CLI. And then you Postgres take house boring stuff. So yeah, build
build cool tech with boring tech.

01:07:25:18 - 01:07:51:28
Stefan
No, I like it. And then with the in mind though, maybe we'll have to talk about this on the next
episode. But big companies, big tech companies, huge ones, Netflix, Expedia, just big
enterprises in general, especially if they're a little bit more modern, like last 20 years. I will say
they like to build stuff internally themselves. They like to build these things.

01:07:51:28 - 01:08:11:26
Stefan
They like to complicate things. And I think it's because you attract talented developers that want
to solve cool problems. Like, I don't want to throw Pinterest under the bus, but one of our a guy
that I know that works at Pinterest, he's like, I don't care about mood boards, but I care about
the tech and the stuff that we're internally building at Pinterest.

01:08:11:26 - 01:08:27:08
Stefan
But he's like, I don't care about that. And you always say this, don't focus on the tech, focus on
the business. But for developers, for example, like choosing boring tech, they like to work at
companies with complex tech. They like to spin up their own bare metal servers. They like to
solve these technical problems. What do you do at that point?

01:08:27:09 - 01:08:43:17
Stefan
Like do companies? Should they focus on boring tech even though it's boring and providing
value to the company? Or should they focus on building stuff themselves? Because it's cool and
they have the resources because they're a big company.

01:08:43:19 - 01:09:17:08
Jens
Good question. I mean, I'm I'm the wrong person to ask what a big tech company should do. I, I
lead a very small tech company. Yeah. I, I don't know, like, in the past. So I don't want to rant
about anybody. I can, but I can speak from experience. In the past, I worked for, for a big
German company, the news company, and we had bare metal servers.

01:09:17:11 - 01:09:50:11
Jens
Crazy. And we had a data center. Actually, two and because we had these data centers, we had
people to maintain the data centers. So the logical thing you do is if you have data centers, racks
with big machines, and you have people you install and run your own Kubernetes clusters. And I
think that's that's a fabulous way of wasting all your time and doing stuff that doesn't bring the
business forward.

01:09:50:11 - 01:10:24:14
Jens
So and I think as a developer, it's very dangerous to do things that do not directly affect the
business. Like, you know, we keep hearing about people getting cut like the last 10% here,
20%. They're like, people are getting cut and lose their jobs. Do you lose your job if what you're
building directly affects business, or do you lose your job if you run Kubernetes clusters?

01:10:24:14 - 01:10:33:10
Jens
When we could also just go to the cloud and click on the button and have a Kubernetes cluster. I
know it's not like you.

01:10:33:10 - 01:10:34:16
Stefan
Know that spicy.

01:10:34:22 - 01:10:36:03
Jens
Button, but.

01:10:36:05 - 01:10:44:11
Stefan
That's spicy. That's a good topic for next week. I like that one. So sadly we are at time. But Jens
you're going to say.

01:10:44:13 - 01:10:47:07
Jens
Do you know what is the good thing?

01:10:47:09 - 01:10:49:10
Stefan
What's the good thing?

01:10:49:12 - 01:10:51:16
Jens
We're back next week.

01:10:51:19 - 01:11:00:09
Stefan
And we have a spicy topic how to avoid a layoff. I work on the title but I like it. Thanks you guys.
Thank you guys so much. And we'll see you guys next week.

01:11:00:11 - 01:11:00:21
Jens
Cheers.
