summary: |
  Stefan and Jens critique Prisma's unclear positioning of unikernel technology, noting it's buried as a small link leading to an external blog post rather than being prominently featured. They discuss how technical differentiators like unikernel should be more prominent if they're truly game-changing, and analyze the product's messaging hierarchy and navigation issues.

00:10:19:24 - 00:10:26:17
Jens
And then on the right side they have uni kernel powered.
00:10:26:19 - 00:10:58:01
Jens
I really don't understand the message like absolutely not. You know the, the I think what they
are trying to say is they can completely change my workflow based on the unikernel technology,
but they make this a little link and it's, it's a sub message. It's. I don't yeah, I don't know, I think I
would make this unikernel thing more prominent because maybe that's, that's the real game
changer, which I'm not sure if it is.
00:10:58:01 - 00:11:04:07
Stefan
But by the way, guess where this links.
00:11:04:09 - 00:11:08:06
Jens
Guess where this links. It looks like an external link.
00:11:08:08 - 00:11:18:18
Stefan
Yes, but it doesn't even link to a. If you look down here to the left, it links to a blog post. It
doesn't even link to its own landing page. I feel like that's kind of weak.
00:11:18:20 - 00:11:36:18
Jens
Okay, it should definitely not be an external. It should be, yeah. You know, if you click on product
or can you have a product? Yeah. Here it should say unikernel powered serverless database.
00:11:36:20 - 00:11:40:10
Stefan
Yeah. Managed Postgres for global workloads.
00:11:40:13 - 00:11:42:23
Jens
Okay. Scroll a bit more.
00:11:42:26 - 00:11:46:18
Stefan
This is interesting though.
00:11:46:20 - 00:12:03:05
Jens
A collaborative console experience for your team. So find many. It has more latency. The rest of
the screen I think this is very useful. Get AI powered recommendations to optimize code
performance. This is very good.
00:12:03:08 - 00:12:09:13
Stefan
Do you know what's completely missing, though? From everything.
00:12:09:16 - 00:12:25:16
Stefan
Where is the business value like okay, a collaborative console experience for your team. But
what does that do? It helps us find queries that are lower performing, which translates to what
business value? I haven't seen anything here. On the business side.
00:12:25:18 - 00:12:34:18
Jens
I have one comment on this. So they have prisma Postgres. I can use just Postgres right?
00:12:34:20 - 00:12:34:23
Stefan
Yeah.
00:12:34:25 - 00:12:42:19
Jens
So my biggest question is, as a CTO, why don't we just use AWS, RDS.
00:12:42:21 - 00:12:44:29
Stefan
Yeah.
00:12:45:01 - 00:12:54:12
Stefan
It doesn't tell you to. Like it says, we built something unique. Here's why. For a CTO, it feels like
magic. What does that mean? Like, how does it feel like magic?
00:12:54:15 - 00:13:09:28
Jens
Yeah. You know, I kind of, Yeah, I think I understand what you're saying, so you're you're you're
kind of thinking is. Okay, this is all nice, this cool. But why do I need it? Well, what does it give
me?
00:13:10:00 - 00:13:28:15
Stefan
Yeah. There's no, like, proof. Like, my biggest problem with this landing page is okay, there is no
social proof here. It's just a bunch of logos. It doesn't say used in production by. It doesn't tell
me what business value that I'm going to get from it. And then down here is way too low. Is
boom. There's the social proof.
00:13:28:17 - 00:13:52:12
Stefan
This should be much higher. I don't understand there. But all these points that they've shown me
doesn't tell me any of the business value. Okay. So if how we work with the data base like for
example this one. So you're running on bare metal servers okay. Here to our global edge
network. What does that translate to. That means that your users are going to get access to
whatever they're looking for faster.
00:13:52:12 - 00:14:10:16
Stefan
So your website's going to be faster. If you're an e-commerce website, it's lower latency, lower
latency and everything like, okay, what does that mean to your customers? Well, lower latency.
That means that the website's more performant. They're most likely to buy more because they
can go quickly to the shopping cart. We've seen it with eBay in our case studies, but where is
the business value of what Prisma is redefining?
00:14:10:16 - 00:14:12:05
Stefan
You know what I mean?
00:14:12:08 - 00:14:31:18
Jens
Okay, can you quickly hop to our landing page? We will not yet talk about it. I want I just want to
point one thing out because we have a we have a quote on our website from eBay and that
quote, it is so good because it has super important elements.
00:14:31:20 - 00:14:34:29
Stefan
All right. Let's jump into wundergraph. Can you see it?
00:14:35:02 - 00:14:37:29
Jens
Yes. don't roast anything.
00:14:37:29 - 00:14:39:02
Stefan
I will save it till the very end.
00:14:39:03 - 00:15:17:22
Jens
No no no no no we're doing it. We're roasting later. Okay. Here from eBay, our investment in
WunderGraph's highly performant open source platform will help boost eBay's API ecosystem.
So it's technical and enable our teams to work faster and smarter in building products that help
our sellers thrive. So he is able to. In one single sentence, he talks about a technical solution
that enables people to to do something faster, but not just inside their own company, but actually
the customers of eBay.
