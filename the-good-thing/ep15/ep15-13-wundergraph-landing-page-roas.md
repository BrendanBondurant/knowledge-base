summary: |
  Stefan and Jens turn their critical lens on their own WunderGraph landing page, acknowledging major messaging problems.

Stefan
This is okay, this is good. And then a lot of white space here. Isn't that crazy? Okay, I.
00:59:25:20 - 00:59:29:29
Jens
Think over all the pages is okay.
00:59:30:01 - 00:59:38:06
Stefan
And for those of you that, are not familiar with Germans, okay, can either mean really bad or
really good, but I'll let you guys decide.
00:59:38:08 - 00:59:40:18
Jens
But it's okay.
00:59:40:20 - 01:00:07:28
Stefan
Okay. As we promised, we will also be roasting our landing page. And no, we were not be taking
it easy. So let us go for the last one of today. The amazing, the fantastic and much needed
improvement WunderGraph. So let's start with the hero, the open source GraphQL Federation
solution. I don't know what that means if I was not anybody else other than myself.
01:00:07:29 - 01:00:21:04
Stefan
Okay, okay. Open source GraphQL Federation solution. First of all, it's kind of a mouthful. Open
source GraphQL Federation solution. What are your thoughts?
01:00:21:07 - 01:00:47:04
Jens
So if you know what GraphQL Federation is and for some reason you you don't like closed
source GraphQL federation, then open source GraphQL Federation. Sounds like a good a good
thing to look into. But yeah, that is also the problem of this hero.
01:00:47:06 - 01:01:00:00
Stefan
Okay. And then this is where it gets really funny. And Dustin I'm sorry, but this was Dustin, our
CTO that wrote this part. But we kept it for a, what do you mean full lifecycle API management
for implement?
01:01:00:00 - 01:01:01:21
Jens
I think I wrote this.
01:01:01:23 - 01:01:24:00
Stefan
Okay with you. Okay. So it was you. It's straight up developer talk, schema registry composition
checks, analytics metrics tracing. It's a huge run on sentence. It's it's it's basically trying to get
everything into the sub hero Apache 2.0. No vendor like managed servers just as much as you
can squeeze it. And yeah like all the benefit.
01:01:24:02 - 01:01:26:20
Jens
It's the it's the the elevator feature list.
01:01:26:21 - 01:01:43:19
Stefan
This and then as they like buyer like let's say I'm a CTO or whatever. I don't know much about
GraphQL federation, but I'm looking for a solution for, I don't know, API sprawl or some business
problem that I have. I have no idea if this is even solves my business.
01:01:43:19 - 01:01:49:01
Jens
Problem, but the ICP of this landing page is not what you just said.
01:01:49:04 - 01:01:58:00
Stefan
I know, I know what the ICP is and we hit the ICP, but I was just saying if we're generally
roasting it. Not a fan. Yeah.
01:01:58:01 - 01:02:04:16
Jens
No, this this hero is really bad. So I don't know maybe to two out of ten points okay.
01:02:04:16 - 01:02:26:29
Stefan
Two out of ten. And then if we dive deeper this I love platform engineering. Engineering teams
love Cosmo okay. So that's some social proof. And here are some of the customers. And then
you jump right into what our customers have to say. I really like this. I love this quote, but as I
mentioned earlier in the episode, this is what I wanted to talk about.
01:02:27:01 - 01:02:48:09
Stefan
Complex queries have seen substantial performance improvements. Cosmo plans queries in a
smarter way. The innovation rate that they're keeping up with is mind blowing. While it is a nice
quote and Frederick is amazing again, from the business point of view, what is the impact of the
complex queries that now that you have a significant performance improvements, it sounds like
your brand, like what is the impact to their customers?
01:02:48:16 - 01:02:52:27
Stefan
You know what I mean?
01:02:52:29 - 01:02:58:28
Jens
The, the, the impact will be that the, their customers can can load the page fast, right?
01:02:59:01 - 01:03:20:25
Stefan
Yeah. But do you remember how Vercel has it is like, hey, Leonardo AI saw 95%, decreases in, I
don't know, website performance or whatever. What are complex queries? Well, how does that
contribute to my customers? What are soundtrack your brand's customers experiencing? So I
think that's something we need to improve. What are your thoughts so far?
01:03:20:28 - 01:03:42:21
Stefan
I also like how we have the video one as well. That's cool. And then the logo and then here this
is cool, but these quotes could be a little bit better. Like okay, a solution that is scalable and PC
compliant. Migrated cosmos superintendent. It took just a day to reconfigure everything. I hope
Brendan is watching because Brendan, we're going to need your help on fixing this.
01:03:42:23 - 01:03:44:00
Stefan
Yeah.
01:03:44:03 - 01:03:46:22
Jens
Okay. Go scroll more.
01:03:46:25 - 01:04:01:26
Stefan
Here we go. Okay, so this one all Jens is so boom. Future of Federation. State of GraphQL
Federation. As a CEO, I want people to know I'm CEO. So I put my own quote on my landing
page. So I'm just kidding. Tell me. Tell me about this one.
