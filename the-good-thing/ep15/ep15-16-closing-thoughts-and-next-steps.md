Enough. Yeah it's viable okay okay cool. So guys we did run a little bit over. Yes. That was
actually super fun. I think for everyone that stuck around. Thank you guys so much. If you want
to, feel free to send us some more landing pages, send us your own. We can review those, too.
We're not biased.

Stefan
Obviously. We're going to give ours, you know, the full review that it got, if you saw we were
ripping into it. But yeah. Before we conclude, what was your idea ten score for the
WunderGraph landing page.

Maybe four.
01:13:47:18 - 01:13:57:17
Jens
You know, I think for a certain audience, it works. It definitely worked up until the series A.
01:13:57:19 - 01:14:09:03
Stefan
Okay, cool. So we're definitely going to be improving this, guys. So we might have a special
guest next week. If we do, the episode will be recorded, but the good thing is.
01:14:09:05 - 01:14:10:24
Jens
We're back next week.

Yeah. Awesome. Thanks, guys. Happy Friday. Oh, I almost press leave studio instead of
endstream. Oh, what if everybody just keeps recording?
