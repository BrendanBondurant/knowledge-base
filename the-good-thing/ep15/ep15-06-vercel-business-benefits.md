Jens
We should also, roast SST.
00:25:04:24 - 00:25:11:15
Stefan
Yeah. Yeah, we definitely will. So we'll go through SSTs. We can even go to Apollos if you want.
Okay.
00:25:11:17 - 00:25:30:03
Jens
Your complete platform for the web. So it's not active. It's not doing something for me. Vercel
provides the developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale and secure a faster, more
personalized web. I would say it's it's not bad.
00:25:30:05 - 00:25:37:27
Stefan
web apps, I don't.
Start deploying. Good demo. Okay. And then here so they go straight to social proof. So AI apps
00:25:37:27 - 00:25:55:18
Jens
Know it's it's not just social proof it's it's they immediately go to benefits. Runway build times
went down from seven minutes to 40s. Reduction 95% reduction in page loads go to web apps.
00:25:55:20 - 00:26:01:04
Stefan
I didn't notice, by the way. That's three different companies Adobe, chick fil A, neo.
00:26:01:06 - 00:26:13:02
Jens
I think this is amazing. Like at the very beginning, like if you are a business person, you know
what is a website and Vercel gives you all these benefits.
00:26:13:05 - 00:26:23:14
Stefan
These are some crazy ones too. This one is interesting how they saved one year of developer
time, but look 100% uptime during Black Friday. Even if you're a business person, these are
very important.
00:26:23:16 - 00:26:39:16
Jens
I just have one. One little thing. Which one? You need to click on all these buttons to actually
find all those benefits. I'm not sure if if that's so good, I don't know. Can you not show more of
this without clicking?
00:26:39:18 - 00:26:49:06
Stefan
You can if you go to, resources and then customers. But again, you still have to click through
them and then you can get the full case study. Okay.
00:26:49:08 - 00:26:51:12
Jens
Go back to.
00:26:51:14 - 00:27:10:08
Stefan
They've got some great company logos. And then here get started using our pre-built okay. Now
they have the AI. So this is what V zero. But you know what I'm kind of confused about. If I
wasn't a developer, like if I was a CTO, I kind of still like and I haven't coded in a while. I don't
know if I would understand it yet.
00:27:10:10 - 00:27:17:07
Stefan
Like I'm still kind of a little bit fuzzy, like, okay, so Vercel is a tool that helps me make my website
faster. Is that what I'm getting?
00:27:17:09 - 00:27:25:28
Jens
website.
No, it's it's your complete platform for the web. So you just need vercel and you can build a
00:27:26:01 - 00:27:32:15
Stefan
Okay. And but is there like a WordPress. Does it like provide me like the templates, like how do I
actually build the website?
00:27:32:15 - 00:27:35:04
Jens
You pretend to be stupid, right?
00:27:35:06 - 00:27:38:02
Stefan
Okay. That's. Yeah.
00:27:38:04 - 00:27:42:18
Jens
Like dude it's it's it's just Next.js and. Yeah.
00:27:42:18 - 00:27:46:15
Stefan
So but if I showed this to my mom, she I don't think she'd understand it.
00:27:46:15 - 00:27:49:03
Jens
Okay. Your mom probably doesn't need Vercel.
00:27:49:06 - 00:28:00:14
Stefan
Yeah. Very true. Okay, so git connected. Deployments, developer focused. The collaborative
feature, we always have some thoughts on this. This is interesting. What do you think so far?
This part right here. Let's do this.
00:28:00:18 - 00:28:25:14
Jens
From localhost to https. It's it's good I, I understand you make a git push it builds and deploys.
Great. Every deploy is remarkable. Check with your team. Unreal production. Great UI not just
designs. Yeah. That's that's cool. Privacy friendly lightweight analytics. So we get analytics with
the extra benefit being privacy friendly I mean.
00:28:25:16 - 00:28:44:04
Stefan
Okay by the way do you know what I've noticed about the website. Like look how snazzy and
smooth it is. Like they're doing a testimonial of their website already by having a really good
website. You see this? Yeah, it's quite sexy. All right. Instant rollbacks.
00:28:44:06 - 00:28:50:24
Jens
Go ahead. Deploy on Friday. Yep. Move fast. Don't break things. Yep.
00:28:50:26 - 00:29:05:24
Stefan
And then scale your enterprise without compromising security. Deploy once. Deliver
everywhere. Yeah. Overall, I like their website. I think it's fantastic.
00:29:05:26 - 00:29:34:00
Jens
Yeah, I think, you know, and this is something I, I would say this you can see it with, with bigger
companies, if you are smaller you're more active in the hero like do this or like, you know,
deploy faster with Vercel. But if you are so big as vercel, if the brand already is so strong, then
you go go back to what they are your complete platform for the web.
00:29:34:03 - 00:29:37:23
Jens
And I think you can only do this when you are big enough.
00:29:37:25 - 00:29:47:11
Stefan
I actually think there's some other cool ones that we can go through, but all right, let's let's
Vercel is good. Let's do retool.
00:29:47:13 - 00:29:48:24
Jens
I like retool.
00:29:48:27 - 00:29:49:13
Stefan
You like retool.
00:29:49:15 - 00:29:57:21
Jens
Website not not not the not the tool. I, I've never used retool, but I like the website.
00:29:57:24 - 00:30:17:06
Stefan
Okay. I love the hero, by the way. The best way to build internal software right away. It tells you
what it does. So and then the bottom seamlessly connect databases, build with elegant
components, and customize with code. Accelerate mundane tasks, freeing up time for work. I
actually don't love this part. I do love this part.
