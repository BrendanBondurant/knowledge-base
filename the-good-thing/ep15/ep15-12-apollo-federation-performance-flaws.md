summary: |
  Stefan and Jens identify brand inconsistencies in Apollo's messaging, noting they call Apollo Connectors both "low code" and "no code" in different contexts. They critique the overuse of buzzwords like AI workflows and point out how Apollo's tagline closely resembles Kong's messaging, suggesting a lack of original positioning.

00:54:10:08 - 00:54:25:27
Stefan
Now it's low code. Deploy fast and governance AI workflows. This will this also feels all over the
place like it's like what you said. We want to include AI. We want to include rapid. We want to
include low code chatGPT throw it what it means it to there. I don’t get this.
00:54:25:29 - 00:54:46:00
Jens
You know, by by the way they have a brand inconsistency because yesterday they did a
workshop where they say, Apollo connectors is no code here. They say low code. I think they
should all agree on what they are.
00:54:46:03 - 00:54:51:26
Stefan
I'm not boom. I like this.
00:54:51:28 - 00:54:57:05
Jens
Yes, but you know what's funny? Can you. Okay, read this out.
00:54:57:08 - 00:55:01:02
Stefan
Deliver tomorrow's roadmap today with Apollo.
00:55:01:05 - 00:55:08:06
Jens
Okay. Now open konghq.com.
00:55:08:08 - 00:55:10:21
Stefan
Look.
00:55:10:24 - 00:55:13:07
Jens
I'm, I'm a landing page specialist.
00:55:13:07 - 00:55:24:25
Stefan
No, no, honestly, we've been we've been trying to rewrite our landing page, which coming soon,
so you'll see it. All right, so here's Kong and their hero is. It starts off with there are no API.
00:55:24:27 - 00:55:34:28
Jens
No, it's not about we don't roast them. But the search for tomorrow is like.
00:55:35:00 - 00:55:40:03
Stefan
For today. And tomorrow's API needs. Yeah.
00:55:40:04 - 00:55:46:05
Jens
Someone looked at the Kong website.
00:55:46:07 - 00:55:48:26
Stefan
I mean, it doesn't make sense.
00:55:48:28 - 00:55:59:19
Jens
Yeah. Of course. Okay. Go go go back to to Apollo. We're we're not done. And we we need to
look at the time and roast ourselves. We can go a little bit over if you want to.
00:55:59:22 - 00:56:18:10
Stefan
But, give it a sec I already told the person we're having a meeting with where we'll be running
late, so no worries. Where is our amazing friends? Okay, cool. So now we're back again. Similar
to Kong. Okay, this is cool animation, by the way, but it's way too fast and it doesn't redo it
again. Okay, here we go.
00:56:18:12 - 00:56:43:25
Stefan
Oh it does. That was cool okay. define data once deliver everywhere. Eliminate accumulative
technical debt from back end from front end or experienced API. If GraphQL federation provides
a secure source of truth for the data that powers your business, I'm still missing the business
impact. Like okay, I get remove technical debt, but I still feel that's like two tech two technical.
00:56:44:00 - 00:57:00:04
Stefan
Like any company that's successful, they will always have technical debt. It's a byproduct of
your success. So I'm wondering like where is the quantifiable success? Hey, this company
removed I don't know this much. And this is what they say. You know what I mean?
00:57:00:07 - 00:57:12:00
Jens
They could do it more like vercel where they say, company X reduced boilerplate by 40%.
That's. What you mean?
00:57:12:02 - 00:57:27:02
Stefan
Yeah, like it reduced boilerplate that. Can teams contribute to a unified and composable API?
Okay, but what is the trade off like? What do I do when they're contributing to the graph? How
much time did they save? How much of technical debt, how many lines of code did you know?
00:57:27:02 - 00:57:37:05
Jens
You know what they are doing? I mean, we we understand the space a little bit. Now they are
trying to feed to to spoon feed us. Federation.
00:57:37:07 - 00:57:53:29
Stefan
Yeah. I'm not in love with it. Okay, here we go. Here's finally one. Deliver features faster. Yes,
but where is the numbers? They're also, streamlining federation here as well.
00:57:54:01 - 00:57:58:13
Jens
I like the, the, the visuals on our left side.
00:57:58:16 - 00:58:12:08
Stefan
Me too. I like to schema checks the workflow. This is good. Improve performance. Okay, but
show me, how did you guys improve performance? This is awesome. This is really cool. Oh,
that's that's it.
00:58:12:10 - 00:58:21:04
Jens
You know what I find funny about the animation on the left? On the left side. Yeah. They have
reviews and it has this, this exclamation mark. Right.
00:58:21:07 - 00:58:27:18
Stefan
Okay. Yeah. So it means that I have where is it? Okay. Yeah I see it.
00:58:27:20 - 00:58:29:04
Jens
We are not clicking it.
00:58:29:06 - 00:58:34:28
Stefan
Yeah. Why are we not clicking on the one that actually why why why are we clicking on the one
that is fast.
00:58:35:05 - 00:58:38:03
Jens
9.8 milliseconds. Why are we not clicking.
00:58:38:03 - 00:58:53:12
Stefan
On 15 seconds? Bro, it's so funny. I just realized that look improve performance across
application and then you clearly have one that has an issue 15 milliseconds. And we don't click
on it. We go right past it. That's actually kind of funny okay. That's amazing. Yes.
00:58:53:13 - 00:58:55:25
Jens
But the animation is cool okay.
00:58:55:25 - 00:59:14:24
Stefan
And then you know what's crazy? Like if you can see my bar down here, look how much I've
had to scroll to get the social proof. Like this should be at the top. Look at these logos. Look at
the names of the people. A he looks familiar. There's a couple people here that look familiar, but
I'm not going to say anything.
