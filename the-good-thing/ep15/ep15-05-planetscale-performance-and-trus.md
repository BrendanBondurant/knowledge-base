But you can shape your schema in a way that it, it works with shards. It was developed by, by,
YouTube and it's an open source project. And I think, planet scale took, took over the project.
And I think they, they run this on, on Kubernetes or something. Now, it seems they also heavily
rely on, on, bare metal to improve performance.
00:21:03:04 - 00:21:27:12
Jens
And, I really like the company. I really like what, what planet scale is doing. I think the, like the
customer base is probably very narrow, like, not everybody needs planet scale. Most people are
like an unplanet scale they announced as well. But I think the page is good. Can we scroll a little
bit and see a little bit more?
00:21:27:15 - 00:21:47:15
Stefan
Yes. This is where they start to kind of unlock like for you from a developer point of view, would
you say like in the database world, that performance is probably the most important I or do they
just maybe go in order here? So they start with performance and they start pitching their new
product, which is planet scale metal, and right away is they just kind of that's we were talking
about this is like the cache warmer.
00:21:47:19 - 00:21:50:02
Jens
That's great. The diagram is great.
00:21:50:04 - 00:21:52:08
Stefan
That is that insane, by the.
00:21:52:08 - 00:21:56:06
Jens
Screenshot of Our cache Warmer. It should be on our page.
00:21:56:09 - 00:22:16:14
Stefan
Exactly. This is I mean, performance. Boom. Here's how. Cosmo. You know, we can this is
actually great. We can take some learnings from here. But look at this. They put right away
performance. They tell you what it does. They have this non like you can't even argue with this
screenshot. That's pretty insane. And then they have a customer quote with it which is pretty
amazing.
00:22:16:16 - 00:22:20:24
Jens
Yeah I I can you scroll a bit more.
00:22:20:26 - 00:22:23:18
Stefan
This is where they talk about like this by the way.
00:22:23:21 - 00:22:26:24
Jens
Yeah that's pretty cool. No.
00:22:26:26 - 00:22:38:25
Stefan
Oh is by the way it's a single page application. So whatever you click on it just routes you to the
thing which is cool okay. This is important. So uptime they offer 99.999. Damn.
00:22:38:25 - 00:22:41:06
Jens
Well do you know what that means.
00:22:41:09 - 00:22:51:09
Stefan
Oh I don't have the calculator. But all I know is it's like minutes. It's crazy a month. So what is
99.99999 in a month?
00:22:51:11 - 00:22:57:09
Jens
That's a website like, I don't know, nines.com or something.
00:22:57:11 - 00:23:07:09
Stefan
Let me see. I'm not sure what the url was. Okay. What's the calculator? So it was 99.999.
00:23:07:12 - 00:23:08:21
Jens
It's so funny when you said.
00:23:08:21 - 00:23:33:00
Stefan
Oh my God. Okay, so daily downtime available is 0.86 seconds weekly six seconds monthly 26
seconds yearly, five minutes, quarterly one minute, and 20s. That is some crazy uptime. Holy
crap, how are they able to? I don't even want to ask. And they also have.
00:23:33:00 - 00:23:39:12
Jens
Yeah, they they they need to do a lot of testing and everything. So it's it's a lot of work to, to do
this. Well.
00:23:39:12 - 00:23:47:24
Stefan
Done. And then here. Okay. So now we're down to the cost. Oh bring your own cloud.
00:23:47:27 - 00:24:12:23
Jens
I think it's good. I would say my number one point that I think is missing, I would go more on the
point that running vitesse yourself is very hard. Just use just use planet scale with this, with the
SLA, but. Yeah. Oh, well, I like the page. It's good.
00:24:12:26 - 00:24:18:07
Stefan
Okay. Your turn. What landing page should we look at next?
00:24:18:09 - 00:24:39:17
Jens
Okay. Go. So I want vercel and retool. Vercel. You need to go on an incognito, because you.
Otherwise you might log in. If you have a vercel account. It's a bit weird because, vercel. It it
forces. It brings you immediately to your dashboard. If you are using it.
00:24:39:19 - 00:24:48:23
Stefan
So if you do, if you do vercel slash home, this is their main one, right?
00:24:48:26 - 00:24:49:27
Jens
Yep.
00:24:50:00 - 00:25:01:06
Stefan
Yeah. So it's vercel.com/home. All right. So of course we have the iconic triangle. Okay. Well
let's start your complete platform for the web.
