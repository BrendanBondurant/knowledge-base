summary: |
  Stefan and Jens analyze PostHog's clever reverse psychology marketing, using humor to handle objections directly on their landing page. They highlight how PostHog turns typical sales pain points into selling points, like generous free tiers, usage-based pricing, and transparent automated customer success, creating an anti-sales approach that appeals to developers skeptical of traditional sales tactics.

Stefan
That's kind of the story that I'm getting. Okay. And then boom. SDK for web and mobile. They
like to play on the modern stuff. Stranger hogs the crown. Those are like modern shows. Code
examples. Here's what you can do with post hog. So I would say it's like oh this is funny. You will
hate post hog. Like if you enjoyed jumping on a quick call with sales.
00:40:27:00 - 00:40:47:12
Stefan
If you love needlessly wasting company money we only have usage based pricing that
decreases exponentially with scale you'd rather buy before you try. We offer a free tier so large
that only a fraction of our customers pay us anything. Even worse, we are continually trying to
reduce our pricing. You think your email is a good trade for that free whitepaper?
00:40:47:14 - 00:40:54:17
Stefan
Press control w now or ask your network administrator to close your window. These are actually
pretty freaking good. You know what's cool about this?
00:40:54:18 - 00:40:57:15
Jens
That they do objection handling right?
00:40:57:16 - 00:41:08:22
Stefan
On the landing page. It's exactly like you would rather give out your credit card details to
strangers like you're desperate for commitment. Sorry, we don't offer annual commitments
unless you ask for one.
00:41:08:24 - 00:41:14:24
Jens
I really like the the the, how they call it the the hooks, the pictures.
00:41:14:27 - 00:41:34:03
Stefan
Yeah, they're really good. And like, their animation. Like, you like buying a whole product test
suite to get access to one tool. This is quite good, by the way, if you think Csms are your friends,
honey, those emails are automated. The customer success manager. Okay, I actually love this.
You enjoy sitting through hours of training more than using your product.
00:41:34:04 - 00:41:50:24
Stefan
No training is required to use posthog. They do quite good here. Yeah, okay. Overall though,
there we got some customer proof. But overall like being your first impression on posthog. What
do you think so far?
00:41:50:26 - 00:42:26:07
Jens
I think these guys, engineers. And they are, they are, they are engineering a little bit too much. I
think they should be selling more. You know, one one thing I learned from someone, recently is
if you sell to C level and you make it so engineering style-y and you make it like here starts on
GitHub, open source and everything like C level, people might be thinking if it's open source, is
it actually good?
00:42:26:10 - 00:42:48:29
Jens
Like I want proprietary enterprise software. I know it sounds weird, but some people are put off
by open source and stuff like that. I mean, you can still make it open source, but does it need to
be like this on the landing page? And so thus does c level do they care about how much you
ship or what problems you solve for them?
00:42:49:01 - 00:43:16:06
Stefan
The thing about this is I know they do good in revenue. But this they are they're geared towards
the developer. I like them, though. I think they do a good job. But overall, I wanted to show that
one. And now we're going to jump into a really, really amazing one. Honestly, probably my
favorite. API orchestration for the cloud native world.
00:43:16:09 - 00:43:30:20
Stefan
Steam okay. And guys, for all you guys sticking around like yes, we are roasting landing pages.
We're also praising them. But we will be roasting our own the same way that we are doing
these. So yes, stick around till the very end because not even our landing page is safe. No.
00:43:30:21 - 00:43:36:28
Jens
Ors is really bad and I'm, I'm I'm very responsble.
00:43:37:00 - 00:44:05:03
Stefan
That's okay. Well, let's start off with this one first. Some praise. I love the little background how it
moves. I think it gives you all the space Apollo-y. But I'm immediately thrown off by this
buzzword, the cloud native word buzzword API orchestration. I think it's I don't know what it
means. And then this whether your team is new to GraphQL or seasoned experts, learn why
Apollo is the fastest and safest way to build and scale your APIs.
00:44:05:09 - 00:44:18:09
Stefan
To be honest, this could be the hero. Apollo is the fastest and safest way to build and scale your
APIs and then social proof. But I think that they put themselves in a box with this as well as with
this. What do you think?
00:44:18:11 - 00:44:43:17
Jens
So not sure if you know this, but cloud native is a term. It comes from the, from the Kubernetes
community. It is a few years ago that we heavily used the term cloud native. Like, I don't know,
before, before wundergraph like when I worked at the tyk like the, the, the my my when I was at
tonline, for example.
00:44:43:17 - 00:44:46:09
Jens
How many years is that ago? Like 5 to 7.
00:44:46:11 - 00:44:47:19
Stefan
1 million. I.
00:44:47:21 - 00:45:13:09
Jens
I think like five years ago. We use cloud native much more these days. Not so much. Like my
my standard reaction like and by the this is not just roasting Apollo, but I said this to all pages. It
is not active, API orchestration for the cloud native world. It is not active. And I think Apollo has
not as strong a brand as Vercel.
