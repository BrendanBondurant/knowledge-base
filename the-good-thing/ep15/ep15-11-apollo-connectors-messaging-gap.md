summary: Stefan and Jens discuss technical migration challenges from Apollo to WunderGraph,
  including the need for feature flags to maintain compatibility. They critique Apollo's
  social proof section for having non-clickable customer logos that don't link to
  case studies, while acknowledging respect for Apollo's engineering team, particularly
  Matt.

00:50:17:05 - 00:50:41:09
Jens
Yeah, but no, nobody will know about this. You only learn about this when you migrate a
customer from Apollo to WunderGraph, and you have to add feature flags so that we tell our
router to do stupid things. And we really hate it. But it's it's okay. We're we're doing it. I don't
want to roast Matt. I actually like Matt.
00:50:41:09 - 00:50:48:04
Jens
I think he's, he's a very smart engineer. And I, met him in person, and, he's a he's a good guy.
00:50:48:07 - 00:50:54:25
Stefan
Okay, let's go back to the main one, because we are almost at time, so we got ten minutes.
We'll do this one couple more, and then we'll,
00:50:54:27 - 00:50:57:08
Jens
We also need to roast our own page.
00:50:57:10 - 00:51:01:00
Stefan
Actually, that's for next episode. No, I'm just kidding. We actually have to.
00:51:01:03 - 00:51:04:06
Jens
Okay, scroll a little bit. Let's let's see what's going on.
00:51:04:08 - 00:51:22:00
Stefan
Okay. Social proof. But again, my biggest problem here is it doesn't tell you like who what
trusted by. But I don't know if these are oh they're not clickable. So they're not clickable. You just
pause it I think that's kind of stupid. They should link to their case studies. thoughts?
00:51:22:02 - 00:51:28:13
Jens
Yeah. All of these customers or users or. What are they?
00:51:28:15 - 00:52:02:12
Stefan
I don't know. I have no idea, to be honest. I know what you're thinking. It's funny, but. Okay, let's
move on. Okay? Okay. Boom. New product. Introducing Apollo connectors. Accelerate app
development with Apollo connectors. Bring all APIs together in minutes on a declarative, query
based GraphQL platform. Very technical power. Any app with real time data aren't most apps
powered with real time data and then build, debug, and deploy faster than ever.
00:52:02:12 - 00:52:12:06
Stefan
Okay, that one's interesting and then interactive tutorial. Learn more. See in action. I'm really
struggling with their landing page. I'm not going to lie.
00:52:12:09 - 00:52:36:16
Jens
I have one one thing here. Bring all APIs together in minutes on a declarative query based
GraphQL platform. You know what? Remove query based? Can you Mark query based? Okay,
remove it and read this again.
00:52:36:18 - 00:52:41:07
Stefan
Accelerate app development with apollo connectors bring all I know just this one sentence.
00:52:41:10 - 00:52:42:09
Jens
Now just this one.
00:52:42:09 - 00:52:48:14
Stefan
Bring all APIs together in minutes on a declarative GraphQL platform.
00:52:48:16 - 00:53:13:15
Jens
What what a query based even mean here? I think, you know, I think what happened is, I know
how hard it is to to find this right wording, but to me, it looks like they put together a list of words
they want to have here, and somehow they put them into sentences. But declarative query
based GraphQL platform?
00:53:13:17 - 00:53:18:28
Stefan
Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't even understand what problem Apollo Connector solves. For me, it's
very, very technical.
00:53:18:28 - 00:53:43:26
Jens
I know what it does. I can tell you what's. So let's improve the landing page of Apollo. Okay?
Like okay. The real problem Apollo Connector solves is. Instead of writing a subgraph, you can
now just write a bunch of directives to connect an existing Rest API. It saves you a ton of time
and you don't have to deploy a subgraph.
00:53:43:26 - 00:53:46:05
Jens
This should be here.
00:53:46:07 - 00:54:10:08
Stefan
Stop deploying subgraph. I still think it's to focus especially towards the GraphQL space, but
okay, they can deal with that. And then next building intelligence experiences on graph OS gain
security and dynamic access to any data in context using GraphQL. Okay, built for rapid.
There's our AI angle. Start with low code. I don't know because they were saying declarative
query above.
