summary: Stefan and Jens critique Apollo's landing page and branding challenges, noting
  confusion with Apollo.io (the sales tool) and discussing Apollo's strategy of including
  "GraphQL" in their company name for SEO purposes. They compare this to Jens' decision
  not to include "GraphQL" in WunderGraph's name, exploring the tradeoffs between
  brand clarity and searchability.

Jens
Like everybody knows. Vercel, who's Apollo like? I don't think so many people know Apollo. If
you ask people about Apollo, many people think you mean Apollo.io this. Yeah. This, thing
where where, you can, You can.
00:45:29:21 - 00:45:31:28
Stefan
What is it like for finding emails? Yeah.
00:45:31:28 - 00:45:32:09
Jens
Finding.
00:45:32:09 - 00:45:36:19
Stefan
Email and stuff like, sequences and stuff like that. It's for, like, salespeople.
00:45:36:21 - 00:46:03:20
Jens
Well, one thing I find interesting is, they brought back the term GraphQL for quite some while
the term GraphQL wasn't really on the landing page. Now it's back. But I also find interesting, I
mean, we we don't have to go into too much depth here, but, they are not even making like, you
know, GraphQL. It's not in the hero, but the company name is Apollo GraphQL.
00:46:03:22 - 00:46:14:06
Jens
You know what, Stefan? Have you ever wondered why I didn't make GraphQL part of the name
WunderGraph?
00:46:14:09 - 00:46:33:02
Stefan
No idea. Why didn't you really? Not like I always wondered it. Like so I think the reason Apollo
does it. Apollo graphql is for SEO, like just so that they can pop up when everyone words it. But
is it so you didn't have to compete? Why didn't you make it a part of the word?
00:46:33:04 - 00:46:44:10
Jens
what are you say?
Yeah, just for everybody. So I started WunderGraph kind of alone, not so super successful, but
00:46:44:12 - 00:46:54:10
Stefan
Okay. No, but.
I was going to put, like, a little, like the world's smallest violin, you know, like started it all alone.
00:46:54:10 - 00:47:18:18
Jens
I started it alone, and then, I didn't want to tie the company to a technology, so I. I like the idea
of having a graph, and I, I don't know, I somehow like the word, I, I wanted to bring a little bit of
German into, into the graph and, I don't know, WunderGraph it seemed cool.
00:47:18:20 - 00:47:46:18
Jens
So, but I didn't want to tie it to GraphQL because I wasn't sure if GraphQL would be forever or if
we somehow would exceed the GraphQL market or whatever. And so, yeah, but also Apollo
figured this out. So now the hero doesn't even mention GraphQL anymore. Just the subtitle.
Okay. So API orchestration for the cloud native world, I, I, I don't know.
00:47:46:18 - 00:47:52:05
Jens
Well, what is API orchestration? Do I needed to say what problem does it solve for me?
00:47:52:07 - 00:48:02:15
Stefan
Hey, by the way, since you're a CEO and you're looking to buy a new technology, what? How
does this stand out to you?
00:48:02:17 - 00:48:29:23
Jens
Well, let's read the subtitle. As a CEO. Whether Your team is new to GraphQL or seasoned
experts, learn why Apollo is the fastest and safest way to build and scale your APIs. So as a
CEO, I don't know what GraphQL is.
00:48:29:25 - 00:48:42:23
Jens
Yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe I know what APIs are. Maybe I don't. Yeah, I also don't want to just
make a stupid rant or map.
00:48:42:26 - 00:48:46:22
Stefan
I don't know. Yeah. You know what my favorite detail is though?
00:48:46:24 - 00:48:47:28
Jens
Yeah.
00:48:48:00 - 00:48:54:00
Stefan
Let me point to it. This tiny little animation like what is that.
00:48:54:02 - 00:48:59:06
Jens
It's just it's just a cool animation. Can you click on why API orchestration.
00:48:59:08 - 00:49:11:19
Stefan
Yeah, but if you notice it's us chasing Apollo. You see. And then eventually we eat the. Okay.
And boom. Text wall.
00:49:11:21 - 00:49:43:03
Jens
Okay Matt explains API orchestration rapidly deliver seamless experiences with lower risk. It's
very that is a very, business focused modern apps require integrating multiple APIs, but custom
backend codes to aggregate, transform and deliver them slows teams down. Actually, I did an
interview two years ago with Matt Douglas at the GraphQL. Com he he said something kind of
like that and, I, I agree with him.
00:49:43:03 - 00:50:17:03
Jens
It's it's true, custom backend code to aggregate, transform and, bring APIs to the graph. It's it's a
burden. Apollo's declarative, standards based, GraphQL powered platform. By the way, I
disagree with this. There is little details in how Apollo is not following the GraphQL spec
sometimes, and for backwards compatibility, compatibility reasons, they somehow are unable to
remove those bugs or.
