summary: Stefan and Jens examine PostHog's landing page, struggling to understand
  what the product actually does due to its many features (analytics, testing, observability,
  deployment). They note that while the messaging appeals to developers with modern
  references and technical focus, the broad feature set creates confusion about the
  core value proposition and primary use case.

00:35:11:02 - 00:35:11:16
Stefan
Yeah. What do you.
00:35:11:16 - 00:35:12:13
Jens
Think?
00:35:12:16 - 00:35:27:22
Stefan
I also think it's going to feed into our next company. I don't know if you've ever seen their landing
page, so it's going to be a surprise, but I think you're absolutely right. Have you ever heard of
Apollo? No. This one. This one's interesting.
00:35:27:24 - 00:35:29:15
Jens
We have to roast Apollo.
00:35:29:18 - 00:35:45:01
Stefan
Of course, we'll do it after this one. But I love their landing page. Used to be super cool. I think
they might have changed it a little bit, but have you ever seen posthogs? No. I still don't
understand what they do. Okay. So. Okay, it's.
00:35:45:04 - 00:35:50:22
Jens
It's actually cool because I, I don't know the product. So we can now try to figure out what it is.
00:35:50:24 - 00:35:56:10
Stefan
Okay. Let's just you just go through it. So hero text talk to me. Like, what do you think of it so
far?
00:35:56:10 - 00:36:13:22
Jens
How developers build successful products. Okay, that alone, I'm not sure. The single platform to
analyze, test, observe and deploy new features. Is it like feature flags or.
00:36:13:24 - 00:36:31:09
Stefan
Kind of. So they offer a platform that does all of it. I feel like this should be first. Right. And then
this could be second. A single platform to analyze, test, observe and deploy new features. This
is how developers build successful products. What do you think?
00:36:31:11 - 00:36:42:08
Jens
backed company.
Product analytics session replay experiments. Surveys. You know what I see. Is this is a venture
00:36:42:10 - 00:36:45:03
Stefan
Yes, they but they are venture backed.
00:36:45:06 - 00:36:47:16
Jens
Where where are they in the journey?
00:36:47:19 - 00:36:49:03
Stefan
Series B.
00:36:49:06 - 00:36:51:00
Jens
How long do they exist?
00:36:51:02 - 00:36:53:20
Stefan
Three years. 2 or 3 years.
00:36:53:22 - 00:37:28:19
Jens
Yeah. You know what I what I instantly kind of feel to me, it feels like they started somewhere in
the corner and they expanded into everything. And now, you know, product analytics, session,
replay experiments, surveys, product tours, product roadmaps, web analytics, messaging, heat
maps, no code AB testing, LLM observability, prompt evaluation from management. It it feels
like they are doing a little bit of everything.
00:37:28:22 - 00:37:40:27
Stefan
But did you notice, by the way, what it says. So it's the single platform and then it literally shows
you the platform. Like this is the platform.
00:37:40:29 - 00:37:44:17
Jens
It's it's the tool.
00:37:44:20 - 00:37:56:18
Stefan
Okay. These folks by the way I love this little Easter eggs here. These folks build products users
want with post hgc. Look who they put them. They put themselves I kind of love that.
00:37:56:21 - 00:38:01:13
Jens
Okay Y Combinator. So it's a y C company right?
00:38:01:15 - 00:38:22:20
Stefan
Yeah it's a VC company. But then they have this trial. They have Airbus, they have DHL, they
have Zara, Raycast. They don't when you look at it though, they don't have any old modern
enterprises. These are all pretty like raycast as a startup hasura is a startup Airbus is probably
their biggest one. MistralAI is a startup, but you see what I mean?
00:38:22:23 - 00:38:33:27
Jens
Yeah, but you know, the next, the next title, it's already it's it's it's putting me off ten plus
products in one.
00:38:33:27 - 00:38:42:11
Stefan
This is so funny though. Product engineering has never been so lit. But you know what? I.
00:38:42:13 - 00:38:54:19
Jens
I don't know, but to me this feels like they, they got funding or something and, and the market
was too small when they started. I think posthog started in analytics or something. I'm not sure
one.
00:38:54:19 - 00:38:55:09
Stefan
Hundred percent.
00:38:55:09 - 00:39:00:19
Jens
But they expanded into everything. And, I'm not sure. No.
00:39:00:21 - 00:39:21:08
Stefan
Okay. So you're not sure on and not sold probably doesn't do well in Germany. Here we go.
Okay, so post the world. They give it to you right here. Everything we needed to find out. So we
ship weirdly fast. They joined y C W 20. So winter of 20, they launched open source analytics
thousand stars, iOS, Android, react native feature flags.
00:39:21:08 - 00:39:39:09
Stefan
Offside in Italy. Heat maps segment 33,000 stars posthog the platform. Click house support
session. Replay, raise series A wow. So 2020 is this kind of cool? Series B are they on a series
C it Jesus Christ, they do ship pretty fast.
00:39:39:11 - 00:39:48:14
Jens
But you know you know what I'm wondering why? Why is this on the landing page. What what
do I have from it as a customer.
00:39:48:17 - 00:39:59:22
Stefan
So they're telling you how they using their product have shipped fast. Here's everything that
we've shipped fast. You can do it too. If you use our product.
00:39:59:24 - 00:40:01:03
Jens
Okay.
