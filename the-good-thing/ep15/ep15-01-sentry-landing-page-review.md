  Stefan and Jens spontaneously decide to review landing pages, starting with Sentry's creative approach.

Episode 15
00:00:23:26 - 00:00:33:12
Stefan
And we're back. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing.
My name is Stefan. I'm joined by my co-host, Jens. Jens How are you doing today?
00:00:33:15 - 00:00:37:19
Jens
I'm good, I'm good. I would say rather normal.
00:00:37:22 - 00:00:44:24
Stefan
No. Not bad. How do Germans say they're having a great day? Yeah, exactly. Germans say
theyre having a good day by saying it's not bad.
00:00:44:27 - 00:00:50:06
Jens
Yeah. Did you see the landing page from. From sentry?
00:00:50:09 - 00:00:53:12
Stefan
Is it new, what did they add?
00:00:53:12 - 00:01:12:19
Jens
You know what we could do today? Just as a fun thing. Because, just for the audience, we're
currently heavily thinking about the topic of, landing pages. Can you bring up the, the landing
page? We can go through some landing pages, and we can. We can discuss them if they are
good landing pages, if you like.
00:01:12:21 - 00:01:14:17
Stefan
Yeah, I like that. Okay. One sec. I mean.
00:01:14:24 - 00:01:25:13
Jens
Stefan and I, we haven't planned this. I just had this idea because this, this morning I was going
through some landing pages to to to see what's going on, and,
00:01:25:15 - 00:01:25:29
Stefan
Let's start with.
00:01:25:29 - 00:01:33:26
Jens
Sentry. Yeah. Reload it. Because I think it's so cool. Oh, that's so cool.
00:01:33:26 - 00:01:35:01
Stefan
Awesome.
00:01:35:03 - 00:01:42:21
Jens
Yeah. Okay. Go back up. Code breaks. Fix it faster.
00:01:42:23 - 00:01:43:07
Stefan
Look at this.
00:01:43:07 - 00:01:54:18
Jens
Application monitoring software considered. Not bad by 4 million developers. So I'm wondering,
is sentry only used in Germany?
00:01:54:20 - 00:02:13:20
Stefan
No, this is actually quite good. Like, it's kind of weird. We've been we've been doing so much
research on landing pages and they all typically are very similar. Big hero subtext two buttons.
Try for free or explore the documentation and then kind of like a diagram or something that
works. But this is really creative right here, by the way.
00:02:13:20 - 00:02:17:17
Stefan
You see how it's like when you hover over it, you fix the code.
00:02:17:20 - 00:02:53:17
Jens
Yeah, that's funny, but you know, the, the like one thing I was wondering about, about landing
pages is so you have a call to action right at the beginning. You have try sentry for free, and you
have explorer, the sandbox. So I'm just wondering if you read the hero, are you already in a
state where you would like to try sentry for free, or is it not like, wouldn't the next logical step to
be to to explore the page more?
00:02:53:17 - 00:02:55:22
Jens
Or how do you think about it?
00:02:55:24 - 00:03:22:16
Stefan
Yeah, for me, whenever I'm like looking for a new solution, like obviously I take a look here first
and then I start to scroll down. And so here right away they have the trust. So I'm like, okay,
wow. GitHub, Disney, Atlassian, slack, Lyft, Instacart, Cloudflare, cursor. They all use sentry. You
know what's funny though about here being cursor is they have Disney and Atlassian and all
Microsoft with cursor like cursor is exploding.
00:03:22:16 - 00:03:35:19
Stefan
People are putting it on their logo wall if they can. That's insane. Yeah, but here the trust is
important. But this is where it kind of tells you what it does. This is where I'm figuring out, okay,
is this what I need? What do you think about it?
00:03:35:21 - 00:03:49:13
Jens
So I was looking at the at the designs and, illustrations of of sentry and I'm just wondering, like, I
don't know if for me, it's too playful.
00:03:49:15 - 00:03:50:06
Stefan
00:03:50:08 - 00:04:00:29
Jens
For for something that finds bugs. I'm not sure I, I think it's too playful, but it's it's taste. Probably.
What what's your what's your opinion?
00:04:01:01 - 00:04:21:18
Stefan
Well, it's right here. I think who they're appealing to is developers and developers are a little bit
like on Easter eggs. Quirky. And they like to be playful with stuff like this. That's why they put the
not bad. That's the way I read it as. And then here when they're talking about the important stuff
tracing, code coverage, session replay, air monitoring.
00:04:21:20 - 00:04:28:28
Stefan
This is very geared towards developers. So I think that's why they're kind of going the playful
angle. What do you think.
00:04:29:01 - 00:04:52:00
Jens
So in this view I think there's too much going on. I I don't know somehow I'm, I'm, I try to focus
on this fire thing. I'm not even seeing immediately the, the stuff outside. So I'm not sure how
good that page actually is. Yeah. Like, obviously it's it's made by people who are super
professionals and it's probably better than everything I could build.
00:04:52:00 - 00:05:03:25
Jens
But yeah, we can we can later look at our let's roast our landing page at the end, because our
landing page is also it has many flaws. But first, let's roast other people, right?
