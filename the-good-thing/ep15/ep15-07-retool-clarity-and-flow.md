summary: Stefan and Jens analyze Retool's landing page, praising the immediate clarity
  of their internal software building use case supported by visual dashboards. However,
  they critique execution flaws like invisible CTA buttons, distracting animations
  that pull attention from the main message, and weak claims about being "the best
  way" without proof.

00:30:17:09 - 00:30:42:16
Jens
So. The best way to build internal software. So first of all, I immediately know what they do. Also
this this dashboard on the on the right. It supports this. So I immediately know what they do.
Scroll back up I don't know it. One problem I have is the best way to everybody can say that's
like how do you prove it?
00:30:42:18 - 00:30:59:29
Jens
And then seamlessly connect databases built with elegant components and customized with
code, accelerate mundane tasks, freeing up time for the work that matters most? Yeah, I'm not
sure it's a bit weak. You're right.
00:31:00:01 - 00:31:08:02
Stefan
I think it's weak. Obviously. Then you have the two buttons, but I think this is super powerful.
Sometimes I hate websites like this and sometimes I love them, but okay.
00:31:08:05 - 00:31:10:06
Jens
One comment on the hero.
00:31:10:08 - 00:31:12:25
Stefan
Let's go back.
00:31:12:27 - 00:31:18:09
Jens
What do you see? What do you say the the book. A demo is actually invisible.
00:31:18:11 - 00:31:40:11
Stefan
Yes. And also what I've noticed is since it's to the left. But this is moving here to the right, it kind
of distracts me. You see what I mean? And this looks a little bit. Yeah. Okay. So could use some
work and then that's just one scroll, by the way.
00:31:40:14 - 00:31:42:13
Jens
And then the transition is cool.
00:31:42:16 - 00:31:54:11
Stefan
But it doesn't tell me it's just like okay so you can build apps okay. You can build workflows,
database I can build mobile apps. Is that what it's saying?
00:31:54:14 - 00:32:16:10
Jens
You know, what is my problem? And that's funny. So I was scrolling because I thought apps,
workflows, database and mobile. I thought this is actually just text I didn't think about. I could
hover it, oh, go, go back up and scroll. No, no, don't move the mouse somewhere else.
00:32:16:13 - 00:32:18:20
Stefan
Okay. So just scroll.
00:32:18:22 - 00:32:25:02
Jens
And scroll further. Oh yeah. I didn't even notice that you can do this.
00:32:25:05 - 00:32:28:12
Stefan
Yeah. It's kind of Okay.
00:32:28:13 - 00:32:32:00
Jens
You're you're smarter than me. You you hover that.
00:32:32:03 - 00:32:54:19
Stefan
And then here. Okay. So you got social proof. But again it doesn't I mean they got some great
logos on DoorDash. Where's Volvo? Pinterest. dnoeglskr Jesus. They've got some great ones.
And so okay. So why retool. So it's built for developers connect anything with the rest or
GraphQL API or choose from seven integrations securely share resources and queries across
the team.
00:32:54:21 - 00:32:57:09
Stefan
So the integration part.
00:32:57:11 - 00:33:01:08
Jens
Do you know what? What completely distracts me here?
00:33:01:10 - 00:33:03:12
Stefan
Is it this?
00:33:03:15 - 00:33:05:13
Jens
It's a logo.
00:33:05:15 - 00:33:09:13
Stefan
Oh SAP.
00:33:09:16 - 00:33:39:00
Stefan
That's terrifying to be honest. Yeah. No. Next. Okay, so you connect everything, then you design
it with 100 extensible react code, and then you've got code written in SQL, JavaScript, Python,
integrate with SSL rule base okay. Debugging this one's a little bit weak. Review. That's
interesting. And then deploy and you visible. And anyway it's kind of cool. No I like it.
00:33:39:00 - 00:33:40:15
Stefan
I like their little flow that they have here.
00:33:40:15 - 00:33:43:25
Jens
Yeah it's cool. Also when you scroll you can just scroll through this.
00:33:43:27 - 00:34:07:00
Stefan
Yeah okay cool. So okay now use cases. So if you want to build an admin panel, if you want to
build genAI apps, if you want to build SQL dashboards, workflows, partner portals and then
compliance. This is pretty cool. So reminds me of Miami through Miami Vice Vibes.
00:34:07:03 - 00:34:09:03
Jens
Yeah.
00:34:09:05 - 00:34:16:20
Stefan
Overall I like their page. I really like how it tells the story. Like, sure, I could use a little bit of
work, but I think it's fantastic. Yeah.
00:34:16:23 - 00:34:36:00
Jens
I have a little bit of fear because I think, retool is, is, I think it's a bit in danger because, I think
with the, with the right prompts, many of these things you can cursor today. Right.
00:34:36:02 - 00:34:42:15
Stefan
I would also say so it could be a little bit fearful. I have one by the way. I don't oh go ahead.
00:34:42:18 - 00:35:11:00
Jens
I just saw someone talking about this on on social media. They, they were using retool and they
found it a bit complicated to, to do something and also bit expensive. And they, they just prompt
the cursor and build an internal tool, deployed it on Vercel. And Vercel gives you authentication.
Now, now you don't need this stuff anymore.
