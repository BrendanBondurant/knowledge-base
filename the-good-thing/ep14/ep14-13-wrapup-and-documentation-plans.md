Jens
It's sick.
00:50:14:14 - 00:50:18:28
Stefan
It's insane. Insane.
00:50:19:00 - 00:50:55:00
Jens
It's, Okay. I've seen it the first time, but I think this is very cool. Like, you can very quickly build
those internal apps and you know that the, the, the interesting observation is in the past there
was like, you know, retool and other things and you had to manually connect the data sources
and you had to say, oh, here's my Postgres database, and I want to build this thing and take this
column and take that, and now the new reality is, you have a super graph.
00:50:55:03 - 00:51:25:18
Jens
You, you have this MCP server, you write a prompt and bam dashboards like it's it's
phenomenal. So to wrap this up, if I want to try this okay. Now it's not yet merged, but let's let's
assume you you merge it end of the week. Whereas the documentation where we're kind of
look, you you don't have to show if it's not yet ready, but, I can go to, to Cosmo documentation.
00:51:25:18 - 00:51:27:12
Jens
Right. And then.
00:51:27:12 - 00:51:40:05
Dustin
Yeah, pretty much Cosmo. Cosmo minus docs. And very soon here will be a new section called
MCP gateway. And then we will explain everything, to, to onboard you on this feature.
00:51:40:07 - 00:51:56:23
Stefan
We can even put a banner on the website just to guide people to it because it's so exciting. So
we'll do that on our end. Guys, we are at time, as I mentioned, I hope everyone has a fantastic
Easter weekend. The team will be off tomorrow and then Monday, but if you guys have any
questions, feel free to let us know.
00:51:57:00 - 00:52:12:12
Stefan
For our customers, we are so excited for you guys to try out, this new feature for everybody.
We're excited to it. Let everybody build good APIs. Maybe that'll be our mantra. Let everybody
cook. Everyone should build a good API. And, Jens. What's the good thing?
00:52:12:15 - 00:52:15:12
Jens
The good thing is we're back next week.
00:52:15:15 - 00:52:18:22
Stefan
We're back next week. Thanks, everybody. Bye.
00:52:18:25 - 00:52:20:21
Jens
So.
