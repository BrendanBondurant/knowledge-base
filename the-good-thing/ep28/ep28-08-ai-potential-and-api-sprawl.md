Daniel Kocot
They don't want to.

00:51:13:25 - 00:51:14:28
Stefan Avram


00:51:15:00 - 00:51:38:14
Daniel Kocot
Sometimes or sometimes you don't know who are the real stakeholders. Are you find them over, over time. So you don't know really who are the we? I had a conversation with a customer today where there was a sentence like, we don't have any business people involved in this.

00:51:38:16 - 00:51:41:15
Stefan Avram
Yikes.

00:51:41:17 - 00:51:44:24
Daniel Kocot
It's just it's just backend.

00:51:44:27 - 00:52:01:27
Stefan Avram
One of my concerns there, the that I've kind of seen in the API spaces. And I want to know from your experience if you've also seen this, they know it's a problem. They want to fix it, but they either don't have the time or it's not the very bottom of their To-Do list. Or quite frankly, we've seen it.

00:52:01:27 - 00:52:06:00
Stefan Avram
They just don't care. It doesnt generate business revenue, but they just don't care.

00:52:06:02 - 00:52:13:17
Daniel Kocot
Yeah, and the interesting fact is there is no tool to solve this.

00:52:13:19 - 00:52:41:03
Daniel Kocot
Yeah. No tool yet. Yeah. Maybe maybe maybe AI or something related to that has then the the opportunity to solve this by bringing all the informations together and just say, okay, these are the things we need because the business side requested this, this, this, this, this, and then makes it clear for the engineers what to do. Then maybe this will happen somewhere in the future.

00:52:41:03 - 00:52:48:28
Daniel Kocot
But in the end it's, it's, it's the old problem of building software solutions in companies.

00:52:48:28 - 00:52:51:10
Jens Neuse
It's it's requirements engineering. Yeah.

00:52:51:10 - 00:52:54:11
Daniel Kocot
It's okay. Yeah, yeah.

00:52:54:13 - 00:52:59:05
Stefan Avram
Jens you're seeing it. Yeah.

00:52:59:07 - 00:53:29:07
Jens Neuse
No. You know, and this is something we've been thinking a lot about is it. You know, and and I think it's actually we're moving in the direction with this like LLMS can really help there because I think you need a map from people to requirements to capabilities, and you somehow need to wire this up and make it searchable and need to be able to say, you know, also like?

00:53:29:09 - 00:53:56:25
Jens Neuse
Well, one of the things we we see missing in, in a lot of companies is they have APIs, but they don't know why. Nobody knows why this exists because there's no link between my Rest API endpoints and the capabilities that I actually wanted to have, because nobody ever wrote it down. And, so you, you end up with, what people then call like API sprawl or whatever.

00:53:57:02 - 00:54:32:24
Jens Neuse
You have this large landscape of APIs, and nobody knows what it does and why it exists. And a lot of API's are undocumented. And like, if you're extremely lucky, you you find the company where they have put some services into backstage, but then it's not properly documented what what each service does. So yeah, you you have this whole mess and everybody's talking about, you know, I read this a while ago, if we have a service and we don't understand it anymore, why it exists and how it works, then we call it legacy.

00:54:32:27 - 00:54:46:04
Jens Neuse
And if you if you and this is something interesting someone said about vibe coding, if you vibe code a service and you don't know how it works and what it does, then it's actually legacy from the start.

00:54:46:04 - 00:54:49:18
Stefan Avram
legacy.

00:54:49:20 - 00:55:08:16
Jens Neuse
Which is the segue into, into the last topic, we can, we can cover because we're, we're almost at the hour and we want to respect your time, but, with your experience, from your perspective, what's what's changing with AI?

00:55:08:19 - 00:55:35:15
Daniel Kocot
May maybe this this. Yeah. I'm not not what people expect that it helps us to build better APIs because this is a long term process, because the LMMs to learn from good APIs that are in an organization. But maybe the AI can really underline the process you described, actually, to really to really solve, to solve the things that you have.

00:55:35:15 - 00:55:57:18
Daniel Kocot
This demand processes made more clear because it's more searchable and easy to to detect what people really want and not just be placed somewhere in a confluence where nobody really reads it. It's really it's really capable of okay, I can search for it. I can search for the department I'm in. What are the the the capabilities? They want to have this.

00:55:57:18 - 00:56:29:01
Daniel Kocot
You written in human natural language and really clear. Okay. Then you need maybe somebody or the AI to make clear what this capability really means in technology or not, or it's really something it will be a helper. So it will be a helper to, to to really build or establish a good API culture in, in, in the organization environment.

00:56:29:01 - 00:56:49:16
Daniel Kocot
This is what, what I, what I see there. But it's for me it's, it's still in the beginning. And, and just looking at this MCP right now and this hype around this, it's not really reflecting what, what what is what is actually it. Because people are still suffering on the data. Theyre still suffering on the APIs they already have.

00:56:49:16 - 00:57:33:27
Daniel Kocot
So maybe they have a sprawl. So why should they then have an MCP to, to make then, 1000 APIs available by one call or something? I don't know, but in the end it's really about bringing bringing things together. And maybe underlying the development process of APIs to whatever style they are, because this is also something, something mostly important to to really and maybe, maybe be a helper of, deciding what is the best style for this, what what is meant as a capability because the LLM has learned and we don't have to reflect on people who are not with us in the company anymore.

00:57:34:01 - 00:57:40:16
Daniel Kocot
We can really reflect on what what is what is there. For a long time, actually.
