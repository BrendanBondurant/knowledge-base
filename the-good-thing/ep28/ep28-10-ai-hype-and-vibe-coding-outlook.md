Jens Neuse
So I think in the end we will figure out like there will be some problems that MCP is amazing at solving. But I think we will we will first burn a couple of billions in VC funding for things that absolutely make no sense. And then at some point, like I think like LLMs in general, they have great applicability.

01:05:53:27 - 01:06:12:04
Jens Neuse
Like there are super cool use cases like summarizing and all kind of workflows and reading stuff and also helping and then writing like LLMs are cool. But yeah, for for MCP, I think we're, we're extremely hard. And in searching for problems.

01:06:12:06 - 01:06:17:11
Stefan Avram
That's where. And then then yeah I know we are a little bit over, but do you have time for one more question from the audience?

01:06:17:14 - 01:06:19:23
Daniel Kocot
One more question then I have to leave.

01:06:19:25 - 01:06:38:17
Stefan Avram
Okay. Last question. So this one comes from David. He's on our team. Interesting. He never says the word real talk, but let's let's read the question anyways. Daniel. Real talk. Can you see in the next six months or year, a booming business for consultancies, fixing the mess that AI and Vibe Coding are creating today? It's a great question.

01:06:38:17 - 01:06:42:09
Stefan Avram
Real talk.

01:06:42:11 - 01:06:45:16
Daniel Kocot
Short answer no.

01:06:45:19 - 01:06:54:13
Stefan Avram
Interesting. If you're able to expand and then we'll let you go. If not we can save it for another episode another time.

01:06:54:15 - 01:07:34:10
Daniel Kocot
Because, because the, the boom not ended. So we, we we are still somehow in this business acquirement of using the whole thing. And fun fact it brings value somehow value to the people. So it's really, really something strange because people will not see that there is a problem because they even solved another problem. Not so far. The bad quality of data they already have as a company.

01:07:34:12 - 01:08:06:19
Daniel Kocot
And if they don't see this by using technologies that do stuff with things available, I don't. I don't, I don't see, I don't see, I don't see it because most people are too prominent with it to to really hype, hype to things further. And there there will be some kind of crash maybe next year or the year after when, when initiatives went totally wrong.

01:08:06:21 - 01:08:20:17
Daniel Kocot
But for now, everything is fine. Everybody wants to build agents. Everybody wants to build, their software with vibe coding. And, no big things happened so far.

01:08:20:20 - 01:08:44:27
Jens Neuse
But, you know, I think that's a that's a good reason why it is like that. You can increase your data quality or your API strategy, and that will to some degree improve the business. But what what leaders are currently looking at is, can we quickly spend some money on AI and get fast returns? That is what everybody is now trying to do.

01:08:44:27 - 01:09:11:13
Jens Neuse
And one interesting observation. We see this in our company, but also in research, this whole shebang around AI coding and LLM coding, we kind of figured out and I think more and more people realize as a developer you can use AI to write code. It doesn't necessarily make you faster. It doesn't necessarily increase the quality. It, it, it gives you.

01:09:11:13 - 01:09:43:02
Jens Neuse
It allows you to be a little bit more lazy. But the results are kind of negligible. So you can use cursor. You can also not use it. Vibe coding doesn't work. We have figured this out and what we see in our team. Like for example, David on On the Stream, we did an experiment. We wanted to migrate some very complex code and he tried to use AI, and then he said, yeah, I had to review every little thing because I cannot trust this.

01:09:43:02 - 01:10:01:08
Jens Neuse
So in the end we were asking like, was it really worth it? And he was like, actually, we we could use it. We could also not use it. It's like it's not making us 50% faster. Like the AI boom is not there.

01:10:01:10 - 01:10:28:11
Daniel Kocot
It's in the end it's it's what what what what I always say is you can use it if you are an expert in this, what you want to achieve with AI. So if you know all the things around it and then you can see how this is, this is, this is really, really moving up because there's a lot of trick tricks technology for me involved by using something like ChatGPT and all the other things around.

01:10:28:11 - 01:11:06:17
Daniel Kocot
Because when you ask to to draw a picture with specific libraries and then you say, okay, by using the library, create me and and PNG or, or Jpeg or whatever, it always uses Python in the background. Because it knows Python best. And and this is, this is really something just to see there. So they, they, they actually these these these things don't or the AI doesn't really know all the programing languages.

01:11:06:17 - 01:11:29:25
Daniel Kocot
It's sometimes really thinking about stuff, finding somewhere and just putting the things together. Normally it doesn't, doesn't really work good or not as expected or as as as David said I have to review it. Yeah, I have to review everything I do with this. And even if I want to pimp it up on so on and so on, it will work at some point.

01:11:29:25 - 01:11:52:27
Daniel Kocot
But at another point it will just not work. So it's in the end, it's really something what I say or I see in the API space, nobody is really doing important business stuff with it. So writing open APIs in a in a regulated business context or something like that, when this will happen, we will find out how it really works.

01:11:52:27 - 01:12:04:02
Daniel Kocot
And maybe then there is, the time to fix the mess that happens actually, and say, okay, this is not working, so we should end it. You.

01:12:04:05 - 01:12:18:15
Jens Neuse
Okay, Daniel, that was, a very insightful session today. Thank you for for joining us. Stefan, you know what the good thing is?

01:12:18:18 - 01:12:33:29
Stefan Avram
The good thing is we're back next week. So, guys, thanks so much for joining us today. Daniel. It was a pleasure. We will let you go, but we'll be sending up snippets of this on LinkedIn. Feel free to reshare because this really was an insightful episode and we'll be back next week. Thanks, Daniel. Thank you, thank you.

01:12:33:29 - 01:12:35:00
Daniel Kocot
Bye.
