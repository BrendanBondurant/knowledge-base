Jens Neuse
Okay, Daniel, let's take a step back. Yeah. You're a consultant. You're in the API space for a lot of people. The API space couldn't be more boring. How did you get into that space? And what kept you there?

00:13:49:16 - 00:13:50:26
Stefan Avram


00:13:50:29 - 00:14:20:21
Daniel Kocot
Long story short, when you do Atlassian consulting and you are not living in the green field, you have to integrate. So you see a lot of not the best API's in the world. And you think about, okay, how we can make this actually better. And why are people not really understanding the needs of the other side to, to, to really go into this?

00:14:20:29 - 00:15:14:02
Daniel Kocot
This is how it actually started, because I started as an Atlassian consultant, at code centric, upfront. I was doing technical, product development and, and so on. So really the, the groundwork to really have the development skills and so on and so on. And then happened something I was in a mulesoft project, so doing doing, plumping and understanding why people don't really understand what is what is all about with, with API's actually at some level, see what what is actually happening when you when you see posts from Kim, from Kim Lane and at that time and, and then I read a book about API economy and so on and on.

00:15:14:04 - 00:15:43:23
Daniel Kocot
And then it was clear for me, okay, there is something more then I do. I did a little exercise doing kong consultancy at Code Centric for for a period of time within COVID, but that didn't really reflect. So we ended up in doing real consultancy with no tooling in the background. So really do this API thinking stuff we have here or think about this capability thinking.

00:15:43:26 - 00:16:11:11
Daniel Kocot
I'm published this week and it's it's really about yeah, bringing disciplines together. So looking at architectures, looking at people. So that's why I'm also doing a lot of in the team topologies environment. So it's really a lot of things that come together because in the end the tooling or the technology is not the problem, the problems or the intelligence.

00:16:11:11 - 00:16:37:07
Daniel Kocot
Are the people involved into this. And this is what we are, what we are heavily triggering it. It was a long process to to really get there because you have to do big projects that maybe fail or not work as expected to to to really get there and see, okay, what's the benefit? And then maybe you have possibilities to find customers that that had the same in the past and want to do it better.

00:16:37:09 - 00:16:55:26
Daniel Kocot
And with this we, we go into into the scene like having the idea of APIs or products doing this thinking stuff to be more on the scene, to really understand what consumers want to have. And so this is this is actually the story. It's a long process.

00:16:55:28 - 00:16:58:18
Jens Neuse
So APIs is the people problem.

00:16:58:20 - 00:17:02:11
Daniel Kocot
Yeah definitely. It's it's not it's not a problem.

00:17:02:13 - 00:17:09:09
Jens Neuse
It's not about REST. It's not about SOAP. It's not about GraphQL. No. It's about people.

00:17:09:11 - 00:17:11:02
Daniel Kocot
Definitely. And the scale.

00:17:11:04 - 00:17:15:20
Jens Neuse
That sounds a bit abstract. Like you can't just blame it on the people, right?

00:17:15:22 - 00:17:46:11
Daniel Kocot
No, it's, it's actually the, one of the biggest problems is these little tutorials you find all over. Yeah. How to create a REST API with spring. Technology. It should be possible if this framework is not not capable of creating, rest APIs you can't use it. Really? And all the other stuff involved. Yeah. So you see a lot of fast API stuff when you go on, on, on the Python scene.

00:17:46:11 - 00:18:17:24
Daniel Kocot
So it's always tech related. The problem is then the abstraction layer. So having a tutorial is something different than doing it in the wild because once you have a tutorial it's really, really abstract. So it's not clear how you deal with the data. Normally when you do such tutorials, it's like I'll just go into the database and drop out this table to be a rest API.

00:18:17:26 - 00:18:42:18
Daniel Kocot
That's nice, but it's not efficient in the end. So it's really also about to really think, okay, what is really needed to to create a good environment or a good experience for, for the users to really think about. And this is where it's lacking because people didn't understand in the past what rest rest means. They heard somewhere that SOAP is bad.

00:18:42:20 - 00:19:13:04
Daniel Kocot
Maybe it isn't bad for some use cases might be helpful. Then they they heard other things. So it's really always on technology side. But the understanding is still missing because when you ask, have you ever read a book about enterprise integration patterns? Most of the people leave the fingers down. Yeah, if I'm in the integration space, I have to really read and understand the basic literature.

00:19:13:06 - 00:19:46:00
Daniel Kocot
So if I don't get this enterprise integration patterns or I really understand what I would like to do, it's quite hard. So it's somehow a people problem. It's an enablement problem. Because when people are used to build APIs, they do it as their normal development routine, but they don't really think about if there is a strategy. So they don't ask maybe questions and they don't really understand.

00:19:46:02 - 00:19:47:21
Stefan Avram
Where.

00:19:47:23 - 00:20:15:12
Daniel Kocot
The company or the organization wants to go with that. They just have these features. Oh, they want an API that delivers customer data, but there is nobody questioning it why they want to have it. And what is the impact of this? Is it going outside of the organization? Is it going outside of the department and being inside the organization and so on and so on.

00:20:15:12 - 00:20:40:10
Daniel Kocot
A lot of questions aren't asked. And this is this is the people problem there. So it's not just saying it's the people problem. It's really the understanding, what should I do there. Because technically everything is actually solved. I have different styles to to get the data there. I have different patterns to, to get what, what I actually want.

00:20:40:10 - 00:20:53:11
Daniel Kocot
But there is what is really missing is the connection in between, because normally nobody talks to the business side. And this is also something which is which is really hard in the end.

00:20:53:13 - 00:21:02:27
Stefan Avram
But well said. Jens I have one question, but, I want to pass it to you first. Do you have a question based on what Daniel said already?
