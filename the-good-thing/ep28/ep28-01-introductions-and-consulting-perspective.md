00:02:15:11 - 00:02:16:09
Stefan Avram
Yes. Then be then.

00:02:16:09 - 00:02:21:09
Jens Neuse
Hold up. Yeah. Is that mean? Is that the chair or is it your bones?

00:02:21:11 - 00:02:28:20
Stefan Avram
Yeah, that's a good point. I need to get a new chair. Okay. I'm going to try to sit very still so we don't hear it at all. So hold up.

00:02:28:23 - 00:02:51:02
Jens Neuse
But. Yeah. How are you doing? Take a breath of the stream. You know, like today Jacob has vacation or. I'm not sure what he's doing, but he he can't let go of us. We today we have Brendan in the in the background. He's responsible for clicking the button to start and stop the stream. So thank you, Brendan, for taking that responsibility.

00:02:51:04 - 00:03:03:09
Jens Neuse
Okay. We have Daniel today here. This is cool. Daniel and I, we actually know each other in person. We met many years ago in, I think it was Sweden. It was.

00:03:03:09 - 00:03:04:15
Stefan Avram


00:03:04:15 - 00:03:09:00
Jens Neuse
Where was it again? Oh, platform summit. I think platform summit. Yes.

00:03:09:02 - 00:03:09:13
Stefan Avram
Yeah.

00:03:09:15 - 00:03:10:24
Daniel Kocot
2 Years or something like that.

00:03:10:24 - 00:03:12:15
Jens Neuse
So yeah, it was.

00:03:12:15 - 00:03:15:19
Stefan Avram
A while ago. Do you remember. Yeah I think 2023 maybe.

00:03:15:21 - 00:03:17:07
Jens Neuse
Did you go as well Stefan.

00:03:17:10 - 00:03:22:29
Stefan Avram
No, but I remember you had to go because we got like a last minute conference talk. So I think that's when it was 2023. Yeah.

00:03:22:29 - 00:03:25:00
Jens Neuse
Yeah. We, we did a talk that then.

00:03:25:00 - 00:03:27:15
Daniel Kocot
It's only two years. So.

00:03:27:18 - 00:03:48:04
Jens Neuse
Yeah. Awesome. And Daniel, you you mentioned you you will be traveling. I just saw a picture from Eric W, who's currently at some conferences. I think there's some. What is it? API world is going on currently. Yeah. And what are your plans for next week?

00:03:48:07 - 00:03:51:27
Daniel Kocot
Customers visiting customers.

00:03:51:29 - 00:03:53:22
Stefan Avram
So being an interesting.

00:03:53:24 - 00:03:59:03
Daniel Kocot
It's the normal way in to not be remote all the time. So really really talk with customers.

00:03:59:03 - 00:04:02:14
Jens Neuse
You need to say with more enthusiasm that that's.

00:04:02:14 - 00:04:05:04
Stefan Avram
Yeah customers.

00:04:05:06 - 00:04:29:20
Daniel Kocot
It's not it's I will give a talk that's at a customer on site. So it's a more relaxed thing. And then we have several days when our customer will be dipping into, into integration platforms and doing doing this. We maybe hit later. So so this is what what's really strikes me at the moment.

00:04:29:22 - 00:04:48:04
Stefan Avram
Fantastic. And Jens, we were just talking about this, yesterday we took out some of our customers to lunch and me and Jens were strategizing. We're like going forward into 2026. We need to go. Oh. Just kidding. Can't tell you guys, right? Basically, we might be around your neck of the woods is what I'm trying to say.

00:04:48:07 - 00:05:09:21
Jens Neuse
Yeah. No, that that's, like, you know, in this, I don't know, like Daniel we’re a vendor. You're a consultant. So. So it's also interesting to see a different perspective in the market, but, we started our company after, or right in the middle of COVID. And so it was kind of like the normal thing to not visit people.

00:05:09:24 - 00:05:31:18
Jens Neuse
And, it can be a huge downside, like, you can build relationships in a different way if you if you meet people. And I guess if you're doing consulting in the in the API segment, it's it's probably much easier to do like a webinar or something on site versus doing it virtually. And you can't really meet people.

00:05:31:18 - 00:05:40:00
Jens Neuse
And how do you think from a consulting perspective about being remote versus being onsite?

00:05:40:02 - 00:06:05:01
Daniel Kocot
Oh, being remote is good when you have these deep type of tasks. So you really know what what what you have to do because you you have to write a concept. You have to go very deep discussions with other people where it's just fair enough to be using teams or whatever, or Zoom or Google Meet, whatever is in place there.
