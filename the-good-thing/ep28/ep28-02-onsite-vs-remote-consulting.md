Daniel Kocot
And but really to to have conversations about problems, challenges, whatever, it's it's really important to be on site because sometimes you, you met somebody on accident. It was not planned to meet there. So you, you you meet people you don't normally have meetings with because with this remote thing, you always have to set up a meeting. It's you always it's quite it's quite boring to to really ask, oh do you have some time for coffee.

00:06:37:23 - 00:07:04:29
Daniel Kocot
And we can do it virtually when you are really working remote and in different city and different countries. We have this with customers. It's totally fine because it's not the other way possible, but being onsite at a customer and and talking with the people there, it's it's for for me, it's a boost to, to to really go more into into the project again because before COVID you were always on site.

00:07:04:29 - 00:07:29:14
Daniel Kocot
It was the normal thing to be on site and not to say, okay, I work from home or I work from the office and do stuff remotely, it was really like, be there, listen to the people, have lunch. If you stay overnight, have a dinner together or something like this. And it's, it's now it's, it's a, it's a sometimes a new experience for some people.

00:07:29:14 - 00:07:50:05
Daniel Kocot
So, so because most of them are still. Oh I don't go to the office. It's not worth but but in the end it's, it's more or the for me the results are better when you when you work with people on site because you have them. Yeah. They can't leave. You can book a room for a whole day again.

00:07:50:07 - 00:07:51:13
Stefan Avram
Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:51:18 - 00:08:15:25
Daniel Kocot
It's it's it sounds funny, but when, when you have remote meetings I can switch the camera off. Sometimes we work with customers that don't even have the camera on all the time. So you don't see what they're really doing at all. If we give trainings or, do enablement with, with, customers, it's actually quite hard because you don't know who's really listening.

00:08:15:25 - 00:08:40:24
Daniel Kocot
And so on and so on. And even if you have workshops or deep sessions, it's sometimes better to do it, to do it really on site. So that's why you have to tell, because it's consultancy. So it's not sitting in somewhere as you maybe do do it when when you do more do the product work, you can you can stay at home and be remote all the time if you would like to do so.

00:08:40:26 - 00:08:47:07
Daniel Kocot
For the for the consultancy, it's important to be there where where actually the people are.

00:08:47:10 - 00:08:49:09
Stefan Avram
Yeah. I would add to Stefan.

00:08:49:12 - 00:09:17:04
Jens Neuse
Do you remember. So we have an angel investor from meta Facebook and we once we went to, to San Francisco, we visited the office and, like, not not talking about Facebook, like, it's not like, doesn't matter what you think about them, but what I found interesting is the whole environment at meta, like the campus, it's it enables you to to run into random people and to be like, hey, what are you working on?

00:09:17:04 - 00:09:27:17
Jens Neuse
What what product are you doing? And, and you can build those connections online They would never actually happen because you cannot run into people. And, no, that's so.

00:09:27:19 - 00:09:47:03
Stefan Avram
I want to add to that, though, Jens every time we do a retreat and we're like doing stuff with strategy or anything or in person, Hen's always has guys laptops down. And it's the same thing when we visit customers as we put the laptops down and you can see people are engaged, but when someone doesn't have the camera on and you're consulting with them, the worst is cameras off, okay?

00:09:47:03 - 00:10:03:10
Stefan Avram
And then you go through it you tell them how to set up cosmos or whatever, not even a week later in the slack. Hey, how do you set this up? And it's like we went over that in the meeting, so I'm 100% with you. I like it much better. Also, you do a little bit of work after work.

00:10:03:10 - 00:10:16:21
Stefan Avram
You go get a beer, you get to know this person. And now it's not just a consultant from another company. It's Daniel who I had a beer with. And I know that he's traveling and I know his hobbies. So that way when I ask a question or something's broken, I'm not yelling at Daniel. I'm saying, hey, Daniel, could you help me out?

00:10:16:21 - 00:10:20:21
Stefan Avram
Because we built that relationship. But I would say you've kind of nailed it on the head there. Yeah.

00:10:20:23 - 00:10:44:20
Daniel Kocot
That's that's that's that's actually the thing around. So to really get into conversations with people maybe outside of of of of the whole topic, it's also quite important to, to really have, have some kind of bonding or something there to, to really see if you, if you can really work together. Because when you do projects, we are doing stuff in the, in the bigger enterprises, there's always politics.

00:10:44:20 - 00:11:14:23
Daniel Kocot
You really have to know people good. know what, what, what games are being played and so on and so on. So it's, it's it's that kind of thing also. And you, the more you are related to a person, it's it's so easy. Within COVID it was sometimes quite, quite hard because you have 2d the people faces up front, but you don't really see what what is, what is happening with them.

00:11:14:25 - 00:11:43:21
Daniel Kocot
And sometimes they just drop off the camera and then say, oh yeah, I'm, I'm angry about this and that, and you can't really see the face and anything like that. The real reaction. So it's really for me, it's absolutely the max, the, the minimum to, to be with a customer from nearly one time in a quarter to really see what is happening on site.

00:11:43:24 - 00:12:05:26
Daniel Kocot
How are the people feeling about the things, that happened over, over the period of time and so on and so on. So this is this is most important because remote work and consulting so, so not just do the programing stuff. So really bringing architectures to work and and so on and so on. You need this conversations.

00:12:05:29 - 00:12:30:03
Jens Neuse
You remind me of an all hands like before WunderGraph at another company. So my, my office is direct. I can look into our garden straight and, we had this all hands I put on my headphones, and then camera off like everybody else. And I went to the garden and did some leaf blowing and that that's.

00:12:30:09 - 00:12:33:06
Stefan Avram
Well, yeah, I, I.

00:12:33:07 - 00:12:55:03
Jens Neuse
Have to say, I have, I have a high quality leaf blower from Makita, which has, it's, it's, battery driven. It has two batteries. It's extremely powerful. The batteries only last 30 minutes, but it's, it's a lot of fun, and it has a lot of power.

00:12:55:06 - 00:12:55:22
Stefan Avram
And, you.

00:12:55:22 - 00:13:20:03
Jens Neuse
Know, as a as someone who who works in tech doing some gardening or some leaf blowing or like, you know, we we have, pumpkins in the garden and we have tomatoes and stuff, and gardening is is fun. It's it's it's something where you where you put the phone to the side for a moment and just cut the hedge or do whatever.

00:13:20:05 - 00:13:34:25
Stefan Avram
My favorite there though, you know, the, the memes where it's like you're out your stand up in a remote company and it's like, here we go, here we go. You've been preparing all day doing the exercises, and then you unmute. Nothing from my end. Thanks. Boom. Done day. Oh.
