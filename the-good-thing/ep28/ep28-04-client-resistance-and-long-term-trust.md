Jens Neuse
We have a question from David.

00:21:04:24 - 00:21:06:07
Stefan Avram
Yeah, that's the one I wanted to bring up.

00:21:06:07 - 00:21:34:08
Jens Neuse
I would love to go through the through the flow. Like what is? Because you you you you you mentioned like a bunch of topics like patterns. So, so maybe we can talk about, what what's are good patterns or principles everybody should know like use. You talk about the important books. Maybe there are some standard literature we should all look into.

00:21:34:10 - 00:21:57:09
Jens Neuse
And then in general, how can an organization like think strategically about APIs and, and, what I hear when I listen, I kind of hear that developers often jump the gun. You say, here's a problem. They build a rest API. They haven't even thought about, this, this API in the more broader sense. So I think that that's one thing you say.

00:21:57:11 - 00:22:14:01
Jens Neuse
But here we have a question from, David's question for Daniel. How do you navigate consultancy when the client / customer thinks they know better or refuse to listen to advice?

00:22:14:03 - 00:22:18:22
Stefan Avram


00:22:18:25 - 00:22:40:22
Daniel Kocot
There are different answers to to to the question actually personally, I will drop the customer. Because it's my nerves. It's nerve wracking when there is no, no no respect to to really to really understand why the consultant or the consultancy is doing several things.

00:22:40:24 - 00:22:42:15
Stefan Avram


00:22:42:18 - 00:23:15:13
Daniel Kocot
And. Maybe sometimes people are not willing to, to let other opinions really get into their mind because they are so focused on doing things the way they ever did. So when you talk to somebody who's 25 years doing software development in an insurance company, they have their own way to go. Maybe it's good, but maybe it's not good because something changed in the organization.

00:23:15:16 - 00:23:55:14
Daniel Kocot
So then it's not a part of the the part of the consultant or the consultancy to, to move these people. It's actually part of the, of the organization at itself to say, okay, be more flexible, do this stuff. The others are bringing in, appreciate what they are doing because they have the knowledge. But to be honest, I had a situation like that and I dropped the client because it doesn't make sense to, to to to work with somebody who is not willing to, to, to really understand what, what what it means or what are the differences between and so on and so on.

00:23:55:16 - 00:24:02:27
Daniel Kocot
Because, because in the end they will come back. Normally, or you.

00:24:03:01 - 00:24:03:26
Jens Neuse
Know, we.

00:24:03:28 - 00:24:23:18
Daniel Kocot
does the same thing to them and then say, okay, they were right because we had this in the past, we had a customer that wasn't wasn't, wasn't aware and not willing to take training sessions. We don't need this our people are skilled enough.

00:24:23:21 - 00:24:25:17
Stefan Avram
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:25:19 - 00:25:06:02
Daniel Kocot
It took it took some time. But then they bought the training and saw. Okay. It was really needed because they hadn't had a problem in understanding and a problem in wording. So the people name things differently and don't really understand what the other person means by that. So it's also the things what we saw always when we talk with customers because is this password API is so misused in these days because in the end it's just an application programing interface.

00:25:06:04 - 00:25:40:09
Daniel Kocot
And that could be everything. So it's not quite clear what what what it really is. So REST is not is not only an API, it's some kind of an architectural. So it's really hard to, to, to, to really bring this people to, to the right place in at some point so that the to, to to answer the question, it depends on the customer if he wants to deal with politics and stress or drops the customer, it's, it's really it's really that that kind of thing.

00:25:40:11 - 00:26:09:25
Daniel Kocot
Because the things we do well with, what we call API consulting is really on trust. People have to trust us because we do things. We did them several times. So it's not that we just invented something. We did it always with customers. This is this is the approach behind it. So we don't propose anything that is not be done with a customer or relates to work with customer.

00:26:09:28 - 00:26:27:15
Daniel Kocot
So this is this is mostly important. So it's nothing that that somebody was sitting in a room and, and had this whiteboard after him and just putting boxes together and say, okay, this is the solution. This is what we go into the market with. And this will work. So it's it's really related to, to to yeah. To customer challenges.

00:26:27:15 - 00:26:28:22
Daniel Kocot
There.

00:26:28:24 - 00:26:35:09
Jens Neuse
Do you know this famous video from Steve Jobs on consultants.

00:26:35:12 - 00:26:36:21
Stefan Avram


00:26:36:24 - 00:27:08:04
Jens Neuse
Where Steve Jobs says consultants they, they can't do well because they come to your company. They tell you what to do and they will not stay long enough to see the long term effects of the suggestions they gave. So they will never really learn like two years after. What what they did was actually a mistake. How do you how do you think about that?

00:27:08:06 - 00:27:37:10
Daniel Kocot
To be honest, API consultancy is a long term thing. So we work with customers for more than for nearly five years with customers right now. So it's not nothing. You go in and be there for six months and you move out. This can happen if there is a lot of understanding already, and there's just the idea of getting the last bits of pieces to really get your own initiative running.

00:27:37:13 - 00:28:02:29
Daniel Kocot
This is also what we have with customers. But the normal thing is you stay as long as possible to really see what what is, what is happening behind the scenes, what is happening in in the whole definition of, of enterprise politics. And so on and so on. And this really helps you to to engage and really also grow with the customer, not just to say, okay, I'm in.

00:28:03:01 - 00:28:30:11
Daniel Kocot
Oh yeah. Six month. I'm not interested anymore in this. I have to leave. This is not this is not really working. When you when you really do some kind of I would say it's more related to enterprise architecture, what we do. So you you need some time to see. Yeah. That that it really works out. So it's nothing that that that is placed and comes up after 2 or 2 weeks or something like that.

00:28:30:11 - 00:28:33:12
Daniel Kocot
It takes time.
