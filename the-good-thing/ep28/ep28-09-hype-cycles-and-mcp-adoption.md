Jens Neuse
Well, one workflow I really like about tools like Claude Code, for example, is planning mode. And and I can definitely think of in the, in the broader scope of, of thinking about capabilities and all this kind of stuff. I think, LLMS can be an excellent copilot in helping people be really crisp in what they need, and it can help you with, with prompting and summarizing.

00:58:09:08 - 00:58:32:04
Jens Neuse
And hey, is this really what you want? And it can give you like a playbook to come to good requirements. And then then it can help people summarize requirements. You can have like, like a, like a vector search where you can search across all requirements and find similar requirements. And then you can you can see, oh, someone wants to build something.

00:58:32:04 - 00:58:42:05
Jens Neuse
But actually last year someone else wanted to have a similar capability. Maybe we can bring the people to the same table. Asked what they are trying to do.

00:58:42:08 - 00:59:04:28
Daniel Kocot
Yeah, this this this, this is this is really the things to to to really make, make it worth to use AI and not just for the purpose again of technology or somebody told you or you saw something. It's really about, okay, this is this is bringing value because as you mentioned, I can really search and see. Oh, somebody else had the idea, which is actually totally simple.

00:59:04:28 - 00:59:29:04
Daniel Kocot
To have an idea board or capability board to just say, but even this is what I see hard for people to understand that there are so many easy ways to really to really solve the problems we have. Because having an, having some kind of a board is just like having, a GitHub repository with some kind of issue tracker and just say, okay, I want to have this.

00:59:29:06 - 00:59:57:14
Daniel Kocot
And then somebody can step in and say, okay, somebody already requested, I want to have it too. So it's sometimes so simple, but it's not done or adopted for process in, in in building these things. Because everything that we do relies on integration in the end. And for me it sometimes it sometimes looks like that there's a split between integration and API.

00:59:57:17 - 01:00:18:13
Daniel Kocot
So API is something mystique, quite popular, but in the end it delivers integration. But but people always don't use this term because it's not so fancy, so shiny in the in that place. So this is what what I see actually there.

01:00:18:16 - 01:00:19:18
Stefan Avram
Jens.

01:00:19:20 - 01:00:21:19
Jens Neuse
Again okay. Last question.

01:00:21:21 - 01:00:39:00
Stefan Avram
I was going to say one more before David's question. Daniel, what's the craziest thing or craziest thing you've heard when you went in to talk with the customer, whether it's like, oh, we don't do this or that or whatever, but like, what's, a story that stays at the top of your head like, wow, this company is crazy.

01:00:39:02 - 01:00:40:19
Stefan Avram
Do you have one like that?

01:00:40:22 - 01:00:51:22
Daniel Kocot
Yeah, I have one like that. There was an API built with R, I don't I don't say anymore.

01:00:51:24 - 01:00:56:13
Stefan Avram
Like, like, as in, I feel like I used R, in college. Just kind of like. Yeah.

01:00:56:17 - 01:01:04:10
Daniel Kocot
Use it for statistics and. Yeah. Yeah. And there, there are some, there are some libraries where you can build APIs on.

01:01:04:13 - 01:01:10:07
Stefan Avram
And this was like a big company. Like legitimate company. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Pretty good.

01:01:10:09 - 01:01:18:05
Daniel Kocot
And, and the last thing is this it's the most used API there. Okay.

01:01:18:08 - 01:01:20:03
Jens Neuse
So it seems to be valuable.

01:01:20:05 - 01:01:22:10
Stefan Avram
Yeah.

01:01:22:13 - 01:01:23:25
Stefan Avram
But I like but.

01:01:23:28 - 01:01:30:00
Daniel Kocot
It's crazy from the perspective of. So you can use every framework to build APIs.

01:01:30:02 - 01:01:31:25
Stefan Avram
Yeah.

01:01:31:27 - 01:02:04:01
Jens Neuse
But by the way you mentioned one, one thing like this, this whole, focus on technology. And I think and you mentioned the, the bank at the conference and how other people tried to copy that. I think this is unfortunately one of the big reasons why why the, why the GraphQL ecosystem got such a big hit? Because I think a lot of people applied GraphQL when they didn't need it.

01:02:04:04 - 01:02:27:19
Jens Neuse
And, they later on figured out it's it's not solving my problem. And, and a lot of people, I think it's kind of unfair. A lot of people are, are upset with GraphQL. I think they they never really understood it or they, they didn't need it or, and, there are very good use cases for, for graphql.

01:02:27:20 - 01:02:35:16
Jens Neuse
It's a great technology. But I think in the in the early days it was completely overused.

01:02:35:19 - 01:02:40:10
Daniel Kocot
Yeah. It was, it was there, it was like, as always it was like a hype.

01:02:40:13 - 01:02:42:16
Stefan Avram
Yeah. It's the same with it.

01:02:42:21 - 01:03:12:28
Daniel Kocot
It's the same with rest. There's still this just it's just I wouldn't say hype phase because it's so easy to build Rest APIs full stop. And, when you have a hype, it's the same with with with these event based stuff. There was there was a really big hype. There's still a hype because everybody wants to be event driven, still, even if they don't know what it really means in the end to be event driven or whatever impacts you have there.

01:03:12:28 - 01:03:31:11
Daniel Kocot
So there's always this this relation to technology, but it's not how do I solve the challenges, the capabilities of the business or of my business to really bring value to my company?

01:03:31:14 - 01:03:34:26
Jens Neuse
It's still this, you know, these days it's MCP.

01:03:34:28 - 01:03:58:06
Daniel Kocot
Yeah, it's it's the next the next wave. Actually we don't know. It will be a to a or something or another crazy framework coming up. And being the solver of every problem existing. So there's always and there's always this, this kind of cycle.

01:03:58:08 - 01:04:26:22
Jens Neuse
Yeah. That the the story behind MCP is so weird because if you look into it, some people build tools, IDEs to, to code. And they needed the way to bring in information into the context so they built a solution to attach context to tools. And then they were like, this is we could actually make it open source.

01:04:26:22 - 01:04:56:04
Jens Neuse
And we could we could allow other people to extend the context through, HTTP or RPC. And then they kind of wrote out the, the, the protocol and, and now suddenly and this is something I kind of feel like, you know, now, now that I went through this GraphQL hype, I now kind of see that everybody is now trying to use this MCP solution and figure out what kind of problems could be solved.

01:04:56:06 - 01:05:23:29
Jens Neuse
But nobody like in our customer base, it's very rarely that people are like, we really, really need MCP. It's more like some developers. They are like, MCP could be cool. But if you look from the business side, like the business people, nobody is really asking for for MCP, it's it's they they have different problems and yeah, yeah, it currently really feels like solution looking for problem.

01:05:24:01 - 01:05:31:29
Daniel Kocot
Yeah. It's always you need a solution to solve the problem. But you but you don't have a methodology to, to to really solve the problem that behind.
