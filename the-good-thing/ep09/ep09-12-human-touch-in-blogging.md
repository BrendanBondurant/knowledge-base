  - structured vs human content
summary: Cameron and Jens explore Cursor's applications beyond coding, including documentation,
  research, and content creation. Jens emphasizes the importance of authenticity in
  blogging, preferring autocompletion over agent mode for writing to maintain human
  touch and avoid overly structured, pattern-following content.

Jens
It's it's working on creating like a, yeah, like a federation specification for GraphQL federation.
And let's say you create an RFC that is in the federation space, you can just ask cursor, hey, I
have this RFC here. Take a look at the Federation specification from the composite Schema
group. Are there similar concepts. And how are they dealing with this situation.
00:43:31:19 - 00:43:45:18
Jens
Do they have an opinion on that. And then you can you can learn from that. So I find that very
very useful. Any any other topics, topics any other like approaches or patterns you're using.
00:43:45:20 - 00:44:10:14
Cameron
And I think, you know, I really relate with the RFC type, approach. I think that it's yeah, I've used
it largely to write documentation and keep track of things that, you know, to help me, like just
share what my brain is thinking as I'm going through and writing code and writing, you know,
writing things that make sense to me at the time.
00:44:10:16 - 00:44:36:09
Cameron
And, you know, being able to have a tool that you share that can document it well, in, you know,
either in comments or in just like a markdown file somewhere is very helpful to allow me to, you
know, bring in other engineers to, you know, give people the information they need. And I think
that that's something that I don't necessarily enjoy doing.
00:44:36:09 - 00:44:42:11
Cameron
So I think it's something that is very helpful. For me.
00:44:42:13 - 00:45:15:25
Jens
Yeah, And to be honest, like I think even for example, reporters or like non deaf people should
consider using cursor because let's say you're a reporter, you're you're researching for a topic,
create a project, open cursor. And let's say you have a bunch of websites and Wikipedia articles
and sources that talk about this topic, like for each source, create like one agent tab.
00:45:15:27 - 00:45:41:02
Jens
Tell it to read the website, figure out with a prompt the relevant information something, and then
you I don't know it's you can use it as a research tool. I think cursor is not just like a coding tool.
You can do research, you can write, I don't know, content. I like to write it with, to use it with,
with, writing, blog posts.
00:45:41:09 - 00:46:21:14
Jens
But I have like one, one, one note I have to make because, for me, blogging is an art. And I, I, I
think quite often you can see, when someone wrote an article with AI and for me, it's a big
difference if I ask an agent to write an article or if I use, for example, autocompletion to complete
my sentences, and I have to say I, I, I don't know, but I don't like using the agent mode for
writing blog posts because I think it's not authentic.
00:46:21:14 - 00:46:35:29
Jens
It's, it's it's too much like it's too much following like a structure and the pattern. And it's not for
me. It's not human like, I, I want to have the human touch in an article, so I'm not sure how I'll.
You see that?
