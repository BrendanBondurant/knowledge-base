mentions:
  - Go simplicity and readability
  - TypeScript type safety
  - AI ecosystem tool availability
  - model tracking limitations
  - Kotlin and Scala usage
  - Java avoidance preference
summary: Jens advocates for Go's simplicity and readability in AI code generation,
  while Cameron agrees on TypeScript for web development but prefers Python or C++
  for AI backends due to ecosystem tool availability. They discuss the limitations
  of Go in the AI space and touch on JVM alternatives like Kotlin and Scala.

Jens
I think it's a bit magical to me. And I personally like I'm biased. Obviously I'm writing Go for for
many years, but I think go is a great language to generate with AI simply because go has no
hidden features. It has concurrency. That's that's okay. But overall go is just super simple to
read, like the the code goes from top to bottom.
01:08:35:00 - 01:08:48:15
Jens
It's borrowing code and I don't know, it works. It's fast. It's it's good. What's what's your take.
What what what language would you use for for verb and what would you prefer on the
backend.
01:08:48:18 - 01:09:15:18
Cameron
Yeah. So for web, I agree with you. TypeScript is the way that I always go. I think that it enables
you to have type safety and to be, you know, it's quick to write for me. So I it's what I always go
with. But on the back end, if we're specifically talking about AI stuff, I'm probably going to go
with, with Python and I know, or C++.
01:09:15:20 - 01:09:41:11
Cameron
Actually for depending on what exactly I'm doing. The reason that I say that and that I don't say
go because I am, you know, my background, I've worked a lot with go and I really love go as a
language is honestly it comes down to tools and to what you have access to. You know, with go,
there's a lot of things that are not supported still, within the AI ecosystem.
01:09:41:13 - 01:10:03:05
Cameron
So you don't have access to do some of the things that you need to do to enable, you to really
keep track of the model and the model usage and how the model functions. So that's one of the
hard parts of go right now. And I think that we'll see that change as things mature and develop in
the AI space.
01:10:03:05 - 01:10:29:00
Cameron
But, yeah, that's really where I'm at right there. As for Kotlin, I've seen that a lot too. I'm not a
huge fan, just out of personal preference, but, I have seen it being used and I've seen, you
know, I've also seen Scala Spring Boot as well. But, you know, I try to stay away from Java as
much as possible.
01:10:29:03 - 01:10:31:19
Cameron
If I can. So.
