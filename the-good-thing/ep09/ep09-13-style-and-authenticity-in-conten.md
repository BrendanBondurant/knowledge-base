summary: Cameron and Jens discuss the importance of maintaining personal style and
  authenticity in an AI-driven world. They explore how search engines detect AI-generated
  content, the value of human validation, and the significance of personal taste and
  brand identity. Jens shares how his non-native English patterns contribute to authenticity.

00:46:36:01 - 00:46:57:01
Cameron
Yeah. No, I totally agree. I think it's actually very important. And, you know, a lot of the big
search engines have actually found ways to identify fully AI generated, content, and have
started flagging them and tagging them so that, you know, so then your blog doesn't really help
you as much as, human written blog post might.
00:46:57:01 - 00:47:36:27
Cameron
So I think it's. Yeah, I think so. We kind of get further and further into the AI and then how I can
work with us. You know, we have to be very careful and cautious of validating and backing up
what AI is writing and adding that human touch to what it's, you know, to what it's outputting. I
mean, even in code, there's a certain level of, you know, there's a certain level of need still for
an engineer to actually sit there and look behind the model and make sure that, you know,
because there are things that an engineer can see dynamically, that the model just can't.
00:47:36:27 - 00:48:00:01
Cameron
Because at the end of the day, a model is just probability, like it's just the probability of
something happening. And yeah, so that's kind of how our brains work at this too. But our brains
can take in so many more parameters than a model can look at. And that enables us to think,
you know, to think a hundred miles wide compared to 20 miles wide.
00:48:00:03 - 00:48:29:09
Jens
I think another part is also taste. So I'm not sure if a model has taste, but I definitely have taste.
And like you can agree and disagree. And that's the good thing about taste. But if you, for
example, see over like you can, you can see like I wrote, I don't know, hundreds of blog posts
over the years, and you see content and videos of, of, of me where I appear.
00:48:29:09 - 00:49:06:17
Jens
And you, you can see I have a certain style and I have a certain way to communicate. And, I
have opinions, like all the time they change a bit, but but overall, like, you can see like I have,
like, like a signature. Right. And I think it can be really hard to to, you know, if you just look at
content from, from vendors or you go through tech blogs and they all have like the same style,
the same from the model derived style, okay.
00:49:06:17 - 00:49:30:13
Jens
You can you can tell the model to have a certain style, but it's that personality. And then and I
think also when we're now building software with, with models, it's, it's increasingly important
that we have our that we have our style that, that you can actually see, oh this is this is
WunderGraph. You know what I mean.
00:49:30:16 - 00:49:51:19
Cameron
Yeah. No, I totally agree. I think it's you know, there's nothing interesting about everything being
cookie cutter. It's just like a, you know, we don't talk in monotone. We talk with, you know,
deflections in our voice. We write with that too. We just. Yeah, that's just human and models a
computer still.
00:49:51:21 - 00:50:11:23
Jens
Yeah. For example, I'm pretty sure you can read that. I'm not a native speaker, so you can
somehow see that. And that is one part of, of my identity. And I think it's, it's actually good
because you can. Okay. Yeah. It's a human because AI wouldn't write this way. Yeah. I would
like flatten this or like a noun.
00:50:11:23 - 00:50:33:00
Jens
Right. And, and maybe even in my language how I write, you see certain patterns that are like,
yeah, that's it's not how you normally write in English, but he's doing it all the time. So this is this
thing, okay? He makes this mistake all the time. And, yeah, I, I think that that makes the, the
authenticity. Well, one one other topic slightly correlated to this.
