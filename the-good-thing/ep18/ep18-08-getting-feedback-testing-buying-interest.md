summary: Stefan and Jens address the challenge of getting honest feedback when existing
  relationships bias responses toward politeness. They share a humorous example of
  a bank customer who brutally honest about not wanting to ship faster or modernize
  APIs, contrasting with typical polite lies. They discuss techniques for eliciting
  honest feedback by separating from product discussions and testing commitment through
  manager introductions, beta participation, and payment willingness.

00:44:35 - 00:44:37
Jens
Know.
00:44:37 - 00:44:58
Stefan
When you know, this is a really good one is these people, we know them. We have a great
relationship with this. They don't want to hurt our feelings. Nobody in life wants to hurt people's
feelings. But how do you know to build what people actually want versus what we think that they
want? How do we find that that this is I am being honest with you because people will lie to you
to be nice, to be like, oh, I love your product.
00:44:58 - 00:45:08
Stefan
And it's like in your head, you think that's bullshit? Keep telling me more and more and more
about how do you know to build something that they actually want versus what they're telling us,
what we want to hear.
00:45:08 - 00:45:30
Jens
Yeah, yeah, I think that's a very important question because, if you have existing relationships
with people, the nature of humans is we don't want to hurt others. We don't want to hurt their
feelings. Okay? So some people do, but, generally, we don't want to do it.
00:45:30 - 00:45:33
Stefan
The guy from the bank, remember?
00:45:33 - 00:45:58
Jens
Oh, the. That's, That's a funny we got humiliated by. But it was so funny. My my pitch was, we
we help companies ship faster. And he said, oh, we don't want to do that. We just want to ship
six times a year. And, yeah, at that point, it was very clear we're we're not a fit like, we we help
people build better APIs.
00:45:58 - 00:46:28
Jens
And he was like, oh, our our API strategy is kind of static. And I said, oh, okay. If your API
strategy is static, then, I think you you have not yet looked into AI and what's going on, but okay.
That's fine. So, people don't want to hurt your feelings. So they will lie to you and not not
because they are liars, but because they are humans.
00:46:28 - 00:46:50
Jens
So I think it's super important that that you that you tell them like, hey, and you, you need to
keep reiterating that. Hey, like, for forget about Cosmo. Just, just tell me. Just, you know, just if
you if you hate Cosmo, it's fine. Just just tell me about it. Or and and you just move. Just move
away.
00:46:50 - 00:47:15
Jens
The conversation from Cosmo. And I think also the most important thing, don't talk with your
TAB about solution-izing because it's it's not about like if you asked them what what to build,
they will say, yeah, make Cosmo Foster or something. But what is really interesting is talk with
your TAB about their their life, their pains, their workflows, their problems.
00:47:15 - 00:47:36
Jens
Just talk about the problems. Don't talk about the solution. It won't lead to anything because,
they have to the day to day, they, they typically they are unable to to zoom out and see the big
picture because they are not talking to ten companies about the same workflow. They just know,
oh, I have a ticket in, in Jira.
00:47:36 - 00:47:56
Jens
I have to ship it this Friday. And I cannot make it forward because the backend developer is is
off and they should have implemented the backend. I'm the front ender, but I'm blocked and now
I cannot move on. So you know what? I'm just gonna vibe code some stuff, and I will spend
some time on YouTube.
00:47:56 - 00:48:23
Jens
And next Monday I will tell the, the product owner and the daily scrum that I'm blocked, and then
that's going to be fine, you know? So that's one part. Yeah. To reiterate, make sure that that's,
tell them they can. It's fine if they, if if they, if they tell the truth, then don't talk about the solution.
00:48:23 - 00:48:57
Jens
Talk about the pains. And I think towards the end, if you if you are at the point, how do you feel?
What. Okay. Let's talk about that later. So towards the end, let's say you're, you're in the phase
of so you have feedback, you know, here's something. So then you build the prototype or you
build whatever and you, you you do something, you create something, you create a mock
whatever.
00:48:57 - 00:49:28
Jens
In the first session, you don't show anything. You just explore. Maybe you need a second
session to explore. And then in the third session, the which would be like week 4 or 6, you
should have something, a presentation, a deck. mocks. Maybe you have a product in the
making, raw product. Okay. You show the product, you get some feedback and you, you just
see how people react.
00:49:28 - 00:49:58
Jens
And then it's it's super simple. Will your company buy it? And I think this is the most important
thing. Sales. It's not so much about selling in this case. In a, in a TAB, right. If you are not asking
if they would buy it, then how do you know if there's real interest? Like, you know, you you can
you can ask people like what are your pains, what are your problems?
00:49:58 - 00:50:21
Jens
And they can talk hours and days and weeks about all the problems. Will they will they buy a
solution to solve the problem? That's a that's a real question. So if there's no buying intent, if
they are, you know, let's say they're buying process is they are an engineer. They don't have
buying power. They need to go to the decision maker.
00:50:21 - 00:50:46
Jens
So the first thing you can try in the TAB is, hey, here's the product we're building. Is this solving
your pain? And then they say, yes, it's it's amazing. And you say okay, awesome. Would you buy
it? And they say, well, I cannot make this decision. I have to I need to go to Joe. And then you
ask, would you bring Joe to the next TAB?
00:50:46 - 00:51:11
Jens
Can we talk to him? And they say, you know, what's, I, I think that's too complicated. So they are
not willing to convince their manager to buy this. So are you solving that, really? Like, how
important is it to them? Probably not so important. So you want other reactions. You want a
reaction like, oh, this is fantastic.
00:51:11 - 00:51:33
Jens
Can I try it like let me try it. And then then if they want to try it, you can, you can, you can be,
sneaky about it. You can build hurdles. You know, it's not always important that people pay you.
Like sometimes they can pay with money. But in the early stages, you can also pay in different
ways.
00:51:33 - 00:52:06
Jens
For example, you can you can ask them, can you connect us to procurement or can you send
your MSA or whatever? I just come up with an idea. What could they do? Just figure out
something they could do so they get access to the beta? What do I get? And the whole purpose
of that is to to get them to the point where they have to act, because if they act, you know, it's
somehow it has enough importance for them.
