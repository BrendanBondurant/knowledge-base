mentions:
  - finding real gold in conversations
  - not asking about commuting to work
  - B2C digital applications nature
  - multiple teams working together
  - stakeholder mapping process
  - to-do list prioritization
  - buying solution over everything else
  - hockey stick growth point
  - TAB exploration fun factor
summary: 'Jens explains how to scope TAB conversations effectively by focusing on
  relevant domains like Cosmo''s federation and API space rather than unrelated areas.
  He describes their discovery process: mapping B2C application teams, identifying
  stakeholders and workflows, and understanding daily priorities to find pain points
  significant enough to make customers prioritize buying solutions above everything
  else. The goal is finding behavioral patterns across customers that indicate inflection
  points for hockey stick growth.'

00:38:04:00 - 00:38:25:01
Jens
And it's it's going to be very tough to find real gold. What what you what you rather want to do is
you want to see. Okay, we have Cosmo. It's Federation stuff. It's API stuff. So obviously we're
not going to build a car or something, so we won't ask how people commute to work like this is
not like a problem.
00:38:25:04 - 00:38:50:03
Jens
But what we can do is we can take Cosmo and we can ask them, like, how are you using
Cosmo? And then they they talk about what they do with it and they build digital products or
whatever. Like a lot of our customers, it's the nature of GraphQL. They do, B2C digital
applications like web and mobile.
00:38:50:05 - 00:39:15:17
Jens
Okay. And because so that's GraphQL and because it's federation, it means multiple teams. So
teams need to work together. So that is like two, two things that are kind of super obvious. And
and from there you can zoom out a little bit and you can you can just ask people like okay,
you're building B2C apps and you're doing it with multiple teams.
00:39:15:17 - 00:39:43:21
Jens
So then you ask them, how are you doing it and what are the steps? And then you asked, what
are the people involved and what are the, who are the stakeholders? And then you learn, okay,
that's like product owner, developers, etc., etc.. So you try to map out who are the people, and
then you try to map out what are they doing, what is their day to day and, and what are their,
their top priorities.
00:39:43:24 - 00:40:10:18
Jens
You know, everybody has like a to do list. The question is how do you get to the to the to the
point where they, they, they completely skip that to do list. And the number one thing they put on
top is buying your solution because it solves their, their pain. And so in the end TABbing it's I
don't know I think it's it's a lot of fun.
00:40:10:21 - 00:40:37:16
Jens
You you can you can explore how how your customers behave. And then where were the goals
can be. And then I think, if you start with your TAB, where you want to get at is you want to find
overlap, because how can you, how can you bring your company to an inflection point where it
rapidly growth grows like this?
00:40:37:16 - 00:40:59:18
Jens
You know, this hockey stick point, how do you find this corner? And I would say the important bit
here in the TAB is and I will stop after that. Maybe you have some smarts, but the the important
bit is if you find a certain behavior in one of your customers and you were like this, this could be
our ICP.
00:40:59:18 - 00:41:24:24
Jens
I see this is this could work out. Then you go to similar customer, similar customer profile,
similar behavior. And you're trying to like again, you're not biased. You just ask them essentially
the same questions. And what you are trying to find is that they will give you, at least in some
parts, the same answer or a very similar answer.
00:41:24:27 - 00:41:46:28
Jens
So then you can take these stories. You lay them over each other like one story over each other.
And you see, you know, like a heat map, how this thing, it gets warmer and warmer and that and
that's and at some point you're just like, Holy shit, we we have found it like this. This is a
repeaTABle pattern.
00:41:46:28 - 00:42:16:18
Jens
We, we, we have now figured out, like here, here's a pain point. Nobody is addressing that.
They are using other tool that is not supposed to solve this problem. And they are they are
handcrafting a solution. And we see this across all of them or across all ICP. And then, yeah, not
now. You're you're in territory where we're at that point you, you can think about, okay, how can
we how can we solve this problem?
00:42:16:20 - 00:42:33:16
Stefan
I think you're spot on. It's you're looking for the patterns, but it's really important that you read
them, test or at least just kind of understand how to ask these questions. You don't want to bias
them with your solution. Like, totally forget about your solution, totally forget about your
company, and just really talk to the person and understand what they're doing.
00:42:33:18 - 00:42:50:23
Stefan
Keep it within the same context of like what are their biggest pain points, but also like within the
context of where you are as a company. But do you want to completely remove your solution
from it? And I think what's important, by the way, is, the TAB is who you invite. You want to make
sure that on the TAB is.
00:42:51:00 - 00:42:51:16
Jens
All.
00:42:51:16 - 00:43:16:03
Stefan
People that you have a, you know, not it doesn't have to be a close relationship with because,
you know, if there's people that you're just starting out your software, you're not going to have a
close relationship with them, but it's people that could potentially benefit from your solution, not
a buyer, but potentially benefit from them. Because one, if you're starting out, this allows you a
very easy, a cost effective way before you put years into something that's not going to work is to
understand is this even worth doing for somebody?
00:43:16:06 - 00:43:38:15
Stefan
Because everybody in life, especially with work, they have a to do list of topics. And Jens is
never ending. Dustin's. That's even more never ending. I have my list of to do, but at the very
top there's three three things that are my most important thing. And if somebody were to come
along and say, hey, that number one thing that you have, I actually have a solution to your
problem, I'm going to listen and I'm going to see what it is.
00:43:38:21 - 00:43:51:22
Stefan
And if it's a big enough pain, I'm going to pay for it. And what's really important about the TAB is
the creating this board of people. And what you'll start to slowly realize is, whoa, customer A had
that problem. Let me go talk to customer B about it.
00:43:51:28 - 00:43:52:20
Jens
Whoa.
00:43:52:23 - 00:44:08:29
Stefan
Customer B also has that problem. Customer C whoa. Like this is very interesting. And it kind of
feels like I was telling Jens about this. It kind of feels like we're a pirate and we're going a
different islands and we're digging and we're digging, we're digging. We found a little gold coin,
and then we find another gold coin.
00:44:09:01 - 00:44:32:13
Stefan
In product market fit is finding that gold chest because you went and you've talked to all these
people. You've got a gold coin, you follow the treasure and then now you're a product market fit,
which is that hockey stick growth. Because odds are if ten people are experiencing the exact
same issue and it's very top of mind for them, I mean, just a law of effect there is that there's
probably hundreds of people or thousands of companies that are very much experiencing this
problem.
00:44:32:15 - 00:44:35:22
Stefan
And but what's really important here, though, is, Jens, how do you.
