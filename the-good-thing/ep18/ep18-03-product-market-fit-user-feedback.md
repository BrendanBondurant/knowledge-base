summary: Jens emphasizes founder accountability for strategy failures, noting that
  layoffs often signal misalignment between plans and reality. He describes the feeling
  of lacking product-market fit as everything being "off" - deals take forever, growth
  is slow, despite some sales occurring. Stefan explains that effective sales is about
  listening to identify real problems rather than forcing solutions, with the goal
  being market pull rather than push dynamics.

Stefan
You're deep in thought what are you thinking about.
00:13:11 - 00:13:38
Jens
I don't know. I just think it's important to, to to to own your stuff and to to to not blame people.
Like especially in the startup, if the strategy doesn't work out, who is to blame? Like I think it it's
super simple and yeah. So you're you're. Yeah. No, I, I think that's that's my answer. It's tough.
00:13:38 - 00:13:43
Stefan
Should we transition into a TAB and just kind of explain what it is and what we've been doing.
00:13:43 - 00:14:18
Jens
Yeah, I think it actually aligns perfectly with layoffs because layoffs means, plan didn't align with
reality. And what we kind of figured out over the course of like, two and a half years is, you don't
want to build the startup that where you have to push the solution into the market, where where
you have to to invest so much into into marketing and sales and everything to, to move on and,
or to, to get going.
00:14:18 - 00:14:44
Jens
And, I think we all know how it feels or like, I don't know, I know it, but, you know it. I'm not sure
our audience knows, but, I think you can imagine if you don't know, if you if you have a startup
without product market fit, everything feels a little bit off. There's this pain, there's this.
00:14:44 - 00:15:11
Jens
I don't I don't know how to articulate it, but somehow, like you, you can have some sales. It can
work to some degree. But but somehow you you I don't know, every deal takes forever. It's it's
complicated. And, somehow you're you're not speeding up and, Yeah, the question is Stefan.
Where where does this problem actually come from?
00:15:11 - 00:15:35
Stefan
It's a great question. And you mentioned sales and a lot of people get sales wrong because
sales isn't about forcing your solution down someones throat. it's really listening to people and
figuring out, hey, what is the biggest problem? Why is this the biggest problem? Why is this a
problem within the company? And to a little iterate on the lack of pmf like it's so interesting.
00:15:35 - 00:15:53
Stefan
Everybody will tell you this is like how it feels. And I think you just described it. It feels off, you
know, like you come in to work, there's some sales, there's some growth, but everything just
feels kind of slow versus the opposite where there's sales, a lot ,things are breaking. People are
moving fast, people are talking about your product.
00:15:53 - 00:16:16
Stefan
And this really comes down to is really listening to your customers or to your users and to really
figuring out what they want, but also what the market wants. And your analogy is great.
Everybody says it's like a startup is that you can't push your way into the market, but you can
kind of get there or whatever. But if the market's not pulling you in, you're going to have a really
hard time.
00:16:16 - 00:16:36
Stefan
But I think to answer your question, where it comes from is, is that when like when people are
feeling the lack of it is that they're not feeling the pull, that they're not listening to their customers
and they're not truly understanding what these people are doing their day to day and what they
want from a product. What do you think?
00:16:36 - 00:16:58
Jens
What what would you say is the, the the best way, how customers can vote, how how can they
very clearly say their opinion? Well, what is the most obvious way? credit card Yeah. Look.
00:16:58 - 00:17:17
Stefan
As you know, we learned this the hard way. I'm going to tell small little story Jens. So when we
first started the SDK do you remember huge company. We were so excited with them. We had a
slack connect and they said, I'm going to pay. If you add this. So what do we do? We add this
and before you know it, they say, can you add this?
00:17:17 - 00:17:35
Stefan
Can you add that? Can you add this? And before you know it Jens, the entire company was
working to help this one customer frickin sign their credit card. it took us seven months. And I'll
never forget, like, we were a little bit down and I was like, don't worry, they're going to sign.
They're going to sign. And you were like, when it's been eight months, like, what the hell?
00:17:35 - 00:17:54
Stefan
And you know, we shut the door on them. We closed the slack channel and we moved to
Cosmo. Cosmo was built in three weeks, but by week two, somebody was paying for it. They
were paying for the excuse, my french, but the dog shit version, it was very bare. I don't even
know how they were paying for it, but they paid for it.
00:17:54 - 00:18:05
Stefan
And I think you're absolutely right Jens, if they're not paying for it, the credit card is not attached.
You're not solving something painful enough for them. You're absolutely right.
00:18:05 - 00:18:40
Jens
You know, the the funny thing is, connecting to this anecdote from Stefan. So, I think this this
week, a big, well known company signed up on Cosmo and paid us, immediately. They they
start with the small self-serve account, and they later they want to grow it. But the most
important thing is they they just signed up and paid and members joined, and they are now
building their graph with WunderGraph.
00:18:40 - 00:18:57
Jens
And what did we do this time this week to do it? Did we convince them? Did they come into the
door like, well, how did the because I wasn't even involved in the sales process. But but what
did you do to make this work?
00:18:57 - 00:19:14
Stefan
And just for clarification, this is the same company that a year and a half ago wouldn't pay us
and we just kept building features for them, so we completely stopped talking to them. We went
all in on Cosmo, and the only thing that happened is we would have conversations from time to
time, but about football, about football. Yeah.
00:19:14 - 00:19:35
Stefan
So we were talking about football. And then what happened is we actually solved a problem for
that. A problem they are willing to pay for. That's the biggest difference, is that we didn't talk to
them. We went all in on the solution and we were listening. And while we were listening to our
other customers, this customer also had the problem our other customers have.
00:19:35 - 00:19:55
Stefan
But it was a big enough problem and they attached their credit card to it. And right away they
validated our solution, which was, hey, we're solving this problem. We could have spent, by the
way, with the SDK years trying to convince people. But you cannot convince people to buy
something. You can, sometimes. But what's going to happen is they're going to churn because
they're going to realize it's not a good fit for me.
00:19:55 - 00:20:00
Stefan
And I think you're absolutely right, by the way, we talked about football. That's all we did.
