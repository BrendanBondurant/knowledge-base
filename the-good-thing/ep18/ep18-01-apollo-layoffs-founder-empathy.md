Episode 18
00:00:19:17 - 00:00:38:08
Stefan
And we're live. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing.
Today we're back, of course, with my co-host Jens. Jens How are you doing today? I'm good.
It's the same introduction every week. Before we start, I would love to share a little joke that I
told Jens yesterday that I thought was pretty funny, but,
00:00:38:13 - 00:00:43:20
Stefan
How do you know if somebody is a Linux or neovim user? Ends.
00:00:43:23 - 00:00:45:11
Jens
They tell you.
00:00:45:13 - 00:01:03:25
Stefan
That the first thing they'll do is say, hi, I'm a Linux in the neovim user and my name is Jens.
They say their name. Second, after they tell you that they use Linux in the other room. But I'm
glad you found that joke funny yesterday. But today we're going to be talking about what is a
TAB. So a TAB is a technical advisory board.
00:01:04:02 - 00:01:22:18
Stefan
And we've been rolling it out with our customers for a new product that we're building. And Jen's
been a little bit closer to date on the TAB I set it up. But he's been doing more of the meetings.
So we're going to kind of do an interview style today where I'm going to be asking you questions
about the TAB, things that you've been learning, and then you talk back to me and explain, like
what usefulness a TAB is.
And I think, honestly, anybody building a new product should set up a TAB. Would you agree to
00:01:22:18 - 00:01:29:17
Stefan
that?
Yeah, probably before we dive into the TAB, should we should we talk about some current
00:01:29:20 - 00:01:40:29
Jens
events.
00:01:41:02 - 00:01:45:03
Stefan
Current trends. Yeah. We should do like a current events type current current trends.
00:01:45:06 - 00:01:53:09
Jens
Think I think a bunch of a bunch of, GraphQL experts are on the market. Yeah.
00:01:53:12 - 00:02:10:18
Stefan
So you guys probably haven't seen this if we're not as deep into the space as we are. But, last
week or this week and yesterday, there were significant layoffs. Apollo, mostly the go to market,
the sales and the, was it the product engineering side just kind of all over the company. There
was layoffs.
00:02:10:20 - 00:02:14:17
Jens
I haven't looked deep into it, but I saw some messages.
00:02:14:20 - 00:02:31:01
Stefan
Yeah. So there's been layoffs on the Apollo team. As you mentioned, if you're a GraphQL expert,
we are hiring. So take a look at our hiring things. But, layoffs are never fun. It really sucks. Also
sucks to see this one since its happening in our space, Jens, What are your thoughts on this?
00:02:31:04 - 00:02:55:10
Jens
Yeah, I have a question for you. Like, you know, we we we like to be transparent. We like to, to
talk about things. And, if your competitor has layoffs, how how do you think about it? Because it
the if you, if you look at it face value like as a competitor your first reaction might be, oh that's
funny.
00:02:55:10 - 00:03:20:03
Jens
Like haha losers blah blah blah. But we're, we're, we're not looking like that at at Apollo. We're,
we're I see this more like a formula one. You know, you you can you can respect other drivers.
You can fight with them once you're in the racing seat. It's a race you have rules of the race, but
you can still respect your, your peers.
00:03:20:03 - 00:03:37:09
Jens
And I think yeah, from from your perspective because it, it actually has also negative effects for,
for us. How how do you, how do you think about, a competitor having layoffs? Well.
00:03:37:11 - 00:03:54:24
Stefan
I first try to remove the competitor part and give the sympathy. Like, these are human beings,
human beings with families that they have to support, especially, you know, if they're engineers
or if they're within that team and they're supporting their families. So first is the sympathy part,
because, you know, losing your job is never easy, especially in today's market.
00:03:54:24 - 00:04:11:24
Stefan
It's a little bit harder. Also, when it comes as a surprise, you know, nobody wants to wake up on
a Friday. You know, this happened to me and you're locked out of your email and you get some
bonus bogus email to your personal email saying, hi, you've been laid off effective today. So my
first one is sympathy. You know, like I feel bad.
00:04:11:26 - 00:04:34:14
Stefan
The second part is now looking at the overarching it's never great when a competitor has a
layoff because of two reasons. One is, what does it say about the space and the market? And
they found something that they've experienced, before us, maybe they ran into a roadblock that
we might run into later down the road. So it does put a little bit of fear to that part.
00:04:34:16 - 00:04:53:13
Stefan
And then the other part is maybe it's them, you know, maybe from my founder hat this is a good
thing, you know, like if you go into like the Art of War, now's the time to strike our competitors
weak. But, you know, when you remove that siding to go back to the human side, layoffs are
never fun. And you know, I have the deepest sympathies for everybody.
00:04:53:16 - 00:05:10:06
Stefan
Actually got in a fight with yesterday with some stupid VC because he was punching down on all
the people that got fired from Microsoft. He's like, why would I hire you? You worked at
Microsoft, you're a big cog in the factory. And I was like, you had the opportunity to be nice and
offer sympathy. Instead, you're punching down to people that just lost their jobs.
