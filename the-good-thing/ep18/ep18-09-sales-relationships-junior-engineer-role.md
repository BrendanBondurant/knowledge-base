summary: Stefan explains his philosophy that everything in life involves selling and
  negotiation, referencing Sam Altman's success advice and using parenting examples.
  He emphasizes that effective sales focuses on symbiotic relationships and customer
  success rather than just profit. Jens discusses how junior engineers, despite lacking
  budget authority, significantly influence enterprise purchasing decisions through
  their technical expertise, drawing humorous parallels between enterprise negotiations
  and parenting challenges.

Jens
If they if if you say can, can you send me an intro to your manager? And they say, you know
what, he's very busy then. Then you know, okay, so it's not super important to you and that's,
that's kind of telling. And then you can have all sorts of in-betweens. Like you can ask people
like, will you buy, will you pay, will you do a beta will like just try to get something from them.
00:52:36 - 00:52:39
Jens
Stefan any comments? Well.
00:52:39 - 00:53:01
Stefan
I've experienced this and I think it's just kind of anything like so life is all about selling and Sam
Altman has a very good blog post like how to be successful. And I think the third thing on there
is selling, because everything you do in life is selling. It's selling yourself or a job selling yourself
to buy a purchasing a new house, and why they should lower the rate for you when you go buy
something.
00:53:01 - 00:53:15
Stefan
Yeah, everything is a negotiation when you talk with people, when you talk to kids, you're
negotiating them. You need to go to bed now. I don't want to go to bed now. Why do you need to
go to bed now? You're trying to convince them and you're literally selling them the dream of bed
and a good night's sleep and everything.
00:53:15 - 00:53:41
Stefan
And so when you think about it, everything in life is selling. But the important thing about that
part is understanding what the other person wants. And from our point of view, like, yes, we are
a for profit company, but if you take the profit away, the biggest thing about our sales cycle is
that it starts actually after the deal we sell to customers afterwards, which is we want them to be
successful with the platform and we want them to be, you know, entertained when they're using
the tool.
00:53:41 - 00:54:00
Stefan
They like it. But the second part is, is that they're actually getting value out of it. And I like what
you said is that it has to be like a symbiotic relationship. I give you something, you give me
something, I give you something, you give me something. Whether that's feedback, whether
that's money, whether that's an introduction to your team and all of these.
00:54:00 - 00:54:17
Stefan
Yeah. Access. All of these, by the way, are like a relationship. I give you this, you give me that. I
invite you to my house for dinner. You invite me to your house for dinner. And before you know
it, we're very close friends and sales, literally, that is that you're selling to this person and you're
understanding what they want and what they want to get.
00:54:17 - 00:54:32
Stefan
But one of the things I want to get to is I was thinking back on my times when I was an engineer,
I had no buying power. I just like if I wanted to buy JetBrains, I could just go buy it. I had to go
ask my CISO, hey, I really like JetBrains. Can I use it? Okay, well, why do you want it?
00:54:32 - 00:54:57
Stefan
Well, I like the global search function. I like this, I like that, okay, let me think about it. And I think
it's really important to understand is when you're selling to people, you need to find the person
that can actually make decisions. And if this is a top of mind problem for them, and the TAB
actually helps you understand that, because if you remember, we have a diverse people in the
TAB, and a junior engineer might love the product, but he can't buy it.
00:54:57 - 00:55:13
Stefan
But what can you learn from the junior engineer? You can learn, oh, he might love the product.
Who does he need to go talk to? He probably go talk to his manager. His manager probably
goes talks to his director. The director probably talks the CTO. And you're able to quickly map
out the journey. But I really like what you said.
00:55:13 - 00:55:34
Stefan
And I think it's really important is they're not hurdles. They kind of are hurdles, but I see them
more of like a handshake. I give you my product, you give me feedback. Okay. You want to go a
little bit further? I'll give you trial. You give me access to procurement, okay? And each of these,
when they break, it tells you right away it's a filter really, if you will, to filter that.
00:55:34 - 00:55:48
Stefan
Hey, this person will probably never buy my solution and that's okay. I'm just not a fit for him. But
there's a lot you can learn from the TAB based on all the TABs that we've done currently. I think
we've been doing it just for two weeks. What are some of the most interesting things that you've
learned about these companies?
00:55:48 - 00:55:54
Stefan
And you don't have to say the company could just say the company size, but what are some
really interesting things that you've learned?
00:55:54 - 00:55:59
Jens
Ask me again, because first I have to make a funny comment.
00:55:59 - 00:56:01
Stefan
What is it? What is it about the kids?
00:56:01 - 00:56:11
Jens
You you mentioned everything is in negotiation and you said even, even. Why is this go black?
This is so weird. I don't.
00:56:12 - 00:56:12
Stefan
Okay, I'm moving a.
00:56:13 - 00:56:16
Jens
Little bit forward. Okay.
00:56:16 - 00:56:20
Stefan
Yeah. Was there the forward. There you go. There you go.
00:56:20 - 00:56:32
Jens
You said everything is in negotiation. Also bringing kids to bed. Oh, okay. I think it's so clear that
you don't have kids.
00:56:32 - 00:56:36
Stefan
What do you mean? It's a total negotiation. You're trying to convince them. It's.
00:56:36 - 00:57:08
Jens
It's not a negotiation. It's like you're you're working with a psychopath or someone, you know,
like, just. Just yesterday I brought Liona to bed and, you know, so here's the playbook. You
bring her to bed, you say, now, now it's sleeping time. And, she's like, when, when I so I, I, I
typically cuddle with or something and then we talk a bit and then I stay up.
00:57:08 - 00:57:34
Jens
And then her first move is, Jens. Or. Dad, you you have to rearrange my covers. So the so the,
the blanket, like, I have to rearrange the, the blanket. Okay. I rearrange the blanket. Okay. Let's
do that. So I go out. She's, she's starts crying. Okay, okay. Next level. Then you try to offer, like,
okay, do you want to drink something or whatever?
00:57:34 - 00:57:57
Jens
Okay. You you bring something to drink? Okay, good. She doing something? I go outside, she
starts crying again and I'm like, oh come on. Well, well what do you need? I, I don't want to be
alone. Like, come on. Every, every kid sleeps a lot like we're we're in the other room. And then,
Yeah, then, then next level.
00:57:57 - 00:58:35
Jens
She, she still cannot stop. And then I want to see mom, and I'm like, okay, but we we we don't
want to play this game. So you can see like with, with customers if they want to buy something
like but but you know, with, with kids sometimes there's the like there's literally nothing you can
do because you, you, you know, I, I don't know how this is in America, but in German, in, in
Germany, like the, the new culture is where like, you know, when, when I was a kid, it was
normal to to hit a kid when they misbehave.
