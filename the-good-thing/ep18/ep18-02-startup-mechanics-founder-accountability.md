summary: |
  Stefan shares a controversial view that layoffs often target underperformers while acknowledging good employees can get caught up. Jens explains startup mechanics where companies use external capital to grow faster than organic profitability allows, creating two lines: market expectations and actual performance. When these lines don't align, layoffs result, emphasizing the importance of founder accountability and strategy ownership rather than blaming external factors.

Stefan
So I think the sympathy part is important. And then I also have a controversial take which might
get me in trouble, but usually layoffs. And I'll explain. My reasoning is you kind of cut the bottom
20% of the quadrant not performing. You know, you wouldn't release your best employees. But if
you're a big enough company, sometimes people do get caught in that as like strays.
00:05:34:04 - 00:05:52:13
Stefan
So you might get some really amazing people that were just accidentally laid off or they were
too expensive, or maybe they just had some issue that the management didn't see. But the first
thing first is always sympathy. I always feel bad when any company has layoffs, even our
competitors. What do you think?
00:05:52:15 - 00:06:26:27
Jens
I, I have a multifaceted view on this. So first of all, my view on startup layoffs is this, and it's, you
know, sometimes I hear people being overly negative towards founders who execute layoffs.
And I think that's so I, I agree with your part where you say, okay, you have empathy for the
people who got fired, who got laid off, at the same time, we have to be realistic.
00:06:27:00 - 00:06:56:17
Jens
If you join a startup, you should be aware how a startup works. And yes, I think one fundamental
concept of a startup is the idea behind the startup is, we are not profiTABle. We are growing
faster than we organically could. So we need outside capital to fund this fast growth. So now
you have a problem. You have kind of like two lines.
00:06:56:17 - 00:07:20:08
Jens
So there's like one line is what you expect that the market pulls from you in terms of like like
dollars luck. So you say okay, end of this year we want to make 1 million ARR or end of this
year we want to make 100 million or whatever. So let's say you are at 50 million a year and you
plan that you grow like 10%.
00:07:20:08 - 00:07:45:25
Jens
So 55 men are you want to grow 20%, so you want to grow two to, 60 million. Or maybe you
want to grow to 70 million. Okay. So you have a growth plan. And so to to execute this growth
plan, you need a certain amount of people. Maybe you have a, a function where you can say,
okay, to generate this amount of net new ARR.
00:07:45:27 - 00:08:13:03
Jens
We have to have this amount of new sales, marketing, devrel support or something. Yeah. So
you have a hiring plan to achieve this goal. And obviously nobody can look into the future. So
we can we can make a plan. And we have we can have high hopes. And, I would even say like,
like, you know, I, I respect other founders.
00:08:13:03 - 00:08:52:15
Jens
So I also think the Apollo founders, they know how to execute. So they make a plan and then
comes reality. And I think when you see layoffs, what this means is that there was a plan and
the plan didn't work. They were not able to put the plan into reality, how they wanted and or they
they it's also possible that the company or founders or the management board or whatever, it's
also possible that they have, an idea how they want to execute something or they, they, they
make a project and they hope that they get something out of the project.
00:08:52:15 - 00:09:15:08
Jens
And then after six months, they realize we're we're not getting there. So it's it's it's not going to
work like that. So yeah, I think on the one side, empathy for the employees who got laid off, it's
it's a it's a bad situation of of course. And at the same time, I also have empathy for the
management, for the founders.
00:09:15:08 - 00:09:37:17
Jens
Whoever makes those decisions. Yeah. Because that's that's just how startup mechanics works.
Like, you want to grow fast, you have VC funding and then there's this, this, gap between your
plan and reality and, Yeah, it I think it can happen to every company.
00:09:37:20 - 00:09:56:12
Stefan
You ever heard the quote? I think it's by Mike Tyson. He's like, it's about life or it's about when
you get into the boxing ring, which, like, symbolizes life. But he's like, everybody has a plan till
they get punched in the face, and then the plan goes out the window. And I think you're spot on
is like, people will be very quick to jump on the founders, be like, you idiot, like you knew you
were planning ahead.
00:09:56:17 - 00:10:09:06
Stefan
You knew that you didn't have the thing. And it's like, well, that's the whole point of a startup.
And a good example of this is, remember we were working kind of close with, was it Conway?
No. What was that? Trucking company. Conway.
00:10:09:09 - 00:10:10:10
Jens
Convoy.
00:10:10:13 - 00:10:32:03
Stefan
Convoy. Yes. Yes. So convoy. For those that don't know, they raised a billion, $1 billion in
funding and they went completely under. And the reason why is reality caught up to them. You
know, they weren't producing the maybe the PMF wasn't there. And, you know, startups are
very, very tricky. And, you know, people are very quick to jump onto founders and, to bash them.
00:10:32:03 - 00:10:48:27
Stefan
And one of the biggest things. So again, my dad told me this, he goes, you know, everything in
this world is because the founder took a risk. Everything that you have, everything that's
invented, everything that a company produces is because a person decided, you know what? I
don't like the way the world is. I'm going to go and I'm going to take a risk.
00:10:48:27 - 00:11:07:06
Stefan
And so when it works, it works. And when it fails, it fails. The sympathy and the empathy is
there. And I really think it's important. But I would add to your point, I agree. I think for
management it's tough. You have to go back into the red room. They have to figure it out. They
have to see how to, you know, keep everybody motivated, especially during a layoff.
00:11:07:06 - 00:11:24:23
Stefan
But I would agree. What do you think though about layoffs. And like I see it all the time on
LinkedIn. But like you wouldn't get that stupid quote. By the way you won't get laid off if you
were producing. Do you agree or disagree with that?
00:11:24:26 - 00:12:01:21
Jens
Let's say I hire Lewis Hamilton. Probably not the worst F1 driver, and I put him on the tractor.
Can he be producing? Yeah. Like he's the one of the best drivers. I can also take Verstappen
and tell Verstappen to to do I don't know to, to to build a better framework to, to do federation.
Well so I mean it's, it's super simple to put it on the, on the people.
00:12:01:26 - 00:12:26:29
Jens
I being, being at the head of the company, I have the opinion that if something is not working in
the company, it's always my fault. Like you have someone in the front line, maybe they have a
manager and, maybe not. Maybe they report to me, or maybe they report to someone and that
someone reports to me, or that someone reports to someone and this person reports to me.
00:12:27:03 - 00:12:45:15
Jens
So at the end of the day, it's it's like a tree. I am at the top. And if it's not working, I'm
responsible. Super simple. So just putting it on the like, you know, if WunderGraph doesn't work
or work out, I don't I won't go to the engineers and be like, guys, you have fucked this up like
that.
00:12:45:22 - 00:12:47:20
Jens
Yeah. That doesn't do.
00:12:47:20 - 00:13:04:22
Stefan
Very much for you. It's a very mature yourself. That's a very mature answer. And sometimes you
see like CEOs trying to hide behind that. But really like if you're CEO like you have to take the
blunt of everything. If the company doesn't work, it's because of you. You didn't make the right
decisions or the founding team. But I like that answer.
00:13:04:22 - 00:13:08:14
Stefan
It's very mature.
