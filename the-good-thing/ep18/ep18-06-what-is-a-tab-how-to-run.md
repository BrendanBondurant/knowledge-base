summary: |
  Stefan introduces the Technical Advisory Board concept as both a business tool and personal development method, emphasizing the importance of unfiltered feedback from trusted advisors. He describes their structured approach: 30-minute meetings every two weeks with diverse engineering roles, initially focusing only on listening to understand daily workflows rather than showing products. The methodology, influenced by Adam Frankl, helps clarify product vision through customer conversations in their own words.

Stefan
I like that. And it kind of transitions into where we're going. So the topic of today's episode is a
TAB, a technical advisory board, and not only do I think this is great if you have a company, I
also think this is a great for personal. Like if you want to improve yourself, you should probably
set up.
00:32:30:18 - 00:32:59:29
Stefan
It doesn't have to be technical advisory, but a board of people that you trust or people that you
want to learn from, or people that you want to sell to, or people that you just trust that can give
you feedback back, people that will give you unfiltered feedback about your product or even
yourself. And so what the technical advisory board is, is you create imagine like a board of
people, like the board of directors at a company or just a board of people that give you their
feedback and you set up every two weeks, meetings on the same day.
00:32:59:29 - 00:33:18:08
Stefan
So we do Thursday, and sometimes we do Wednesday afternoon because our schedule is a
little bit different. But Wednesdays and Thursdays every two weeks, I think Jens has six
meetings a day. And with these people, it's a 30 minute zoom meeting and it's no show and tell.
For the first couple weeks. You don't show them anything about the product that you want to
build.
00:33:18:10 - 00:33:38:16
Stefan
Instead, you just talk to them and you listen. And we'll take it from the technical advisory board
of what we want to do, and we just talk with them and we understand their day to day. And it's
important that you build your TAB with people that you think could potentially benefit from your
solution. So we have principal engineers, we have CTOs, we have architects, we have senior
developers.
00:33:38:16 - 00:33:56:27
Stefan
We even have a couple of junior developers. But we have that whole range on to there.
Because the problem that a junior developer has is completely different than a problem that a
CTO has, but you still want to talk to them and understand what it is. And this is from actually
Adam Frankl. He's this, developer marketing guy, this guru, and it's kind of amazing.
00:33:56:28 - 00:34:15:29
Stefan
Like, we set it up and already in the conversations, what you're seeing is things that we're
already working on. But it's so cool to see a customer say it in their own words in a way that you
probably didn't have in your head. And so each meeting that you have every two weeks, the
vision of what you're building, it's clear, clear and clear.
00:34:16:01 - 00:34:36:03
Stefan
And a little anecdote about this is if you ever heard of a company called zip, which is a
procurement software, they built a TAB when they first started of ten procurement people and
they had them pay. By the way, this was crazy to me. They had them pay and they said, I'm not
going to give you the solution yet, but I'm going to give you the best solution in six weeks.
00:34:36:03 - 00:34:49:07
Stefan
But I need you to trust me on this. I need you to be my design partner on it. I'm going to build it
to exactly what you want, but let me, like, talk to me about the biggest problems that you have.
And so for six weeks they worked very closely with these people, this TAB. And they built the
product.
00:34:49:07 - 00:35:06:03
Stefan
And now they're a series D company. And I think what we're doing with this world class TAB is
you're understanding deep down from all these members what their biggest problem is. And I'll
pass it off to Jens now because he's been the closest to them Jens. What have you learned so
far? What do you like about the TAB?
00:35:06:05 - 00:35:14:14
Stefan
What are some of the biggest, you know, antidotes or observations that you've seen that our
customers have been telling us?
00:35:14:16 - 00:35:48:07
Jens
First of all, I think building building a TAB, it's it's a lot about trust. So it's it's hugely beneficial if
you have already built a relationship. So with many of our customers, we we are now together
more than a year. Some of them have renewed already. And so we have built the relationship
with Cosmo. And obviously with the series A investment, we want to go beyond Cosmo, we want
to go further.
00:35:48:09 - 00:36:14:00
Jens
We want to to solve like the, the, the real problem. And I think what is what is super important or
like one way I think about it is you can have different classes of problems you're solving. So it's
it's like, you, you can solve like a day one problem, but you can also solve like a day three
problem.
00:36:14:03 - 00:36:35:10
Jens
And I would say like day one, it's kind of like you're, you're an outsider to the market. Like
obviously everybody is sees themselves as an insider. So so you think you you know, it. And
you have an assumption about the market. So you talk to some people, you, you, you try to
figure out what, what does the market want.
00:36:35:10 - 00:37:10:01
Jens
You you interview people and maybe you get them to pay for something like what you just
described with zip. But still, I think it is it is really hard to to get to the nitty gritty when you are an
outsider. So in our case, I think where the, the real benefit is, and this is something you can do
on day three and then like if you if you are past like seed stage, I think you should absolutely
build a TAB and you should start trying to zoom out of your own solution.
00:37:10:04 - 00:37:38:21
Jens
So like the, the, the first step in the, in the TAB and the most important step is you can you can
read books like mom test and whatever these are these are kind of good to to give you a little bit
of a structure on on how to conduct these meetings, but I think one super important point is you
need to zoom out of your solution, and you need to just stop thinking about what you're doing
because you're, you're you're going to be so biased.
00:37:38:25 - 00:38:03:28
Jens
And it's it's even possible if you if you cannot do it in an unbiased way, just hire someone
external to, to do this. Because the less you know about your solution, the more you know, if
you're thinking in your solution, you try to connect it to everything they have. And it's like, okay,
we have Cosmo. How can we solve all your problems with Cosmo?
