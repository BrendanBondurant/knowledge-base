summary: Stefan and Jens discuss developer emotional attachment to code, triggered
  by feedback from a text.ai founder who felt "roasted" by their tier list episode.
  They explore how developers become personally identified with their work, making
  criticism feel like personal attacks. Jens reflects on WunderGraph's early days
  and the lesson that small startups should embrace their size rather than trying
  to behave like big companies, particularly in how they position against larger competitors
  like Apollo.

Stefan
And we're live. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing.
Joined by, as always, by my co-host. Jens. Jens How are you doing today?
00:00:34:08 - 00:00:40:27
Jens
I'm good. By the way, I last second changed my mic. Is it working?
00:00:40:29 - 00:00:48:28
Stefan
Yeah, I can hear you. It's important. Last-minute change,
00:00:49:00 - 00:01:04:07
Jens
Yeah. Today we're here without our producer. He would ask us to, to, check the mic and
everything, and, Yeah. Hi, Jacob. By the way. You will. You will later see the footage.
00:01:04:10 - 00:01:16:14
Stefan
The funny thing is also, like, I was, like, setting up my, headphones, and I was, like, setting up
the mic. And then I was going through the checklist, and I was like, damn, Jacob's not here. Like
our content guy. I was like, I have no idea what to do. Actually.
00:01:16:16 - 00:01:33:01
Jens
Yeah. Also, welcome to the to the chat. I, I hope we have some fun people again. Like last week
I think last week we had a bunch of fun with some startups. AI startups going through them.
00:01:33:03 - 00:01:38:09
Stefan
You want to hear something crazy though about that. Something, something my background. All
right, there we go.
00:01:38:14 - 00:01:40:14
Jens
But, you get any feedback?
00:01:40:16 - 00:01:50:27
Stefan
Yeah, I got feedback from, the startup founder of, the text one. You know, the chat GPT, but it
lives in your text. We said that it would die.
00:01:50:29 - 00:01:54:12
Jens
Did they did they feel hurt?
00:01:54:15 - 00:02:08:29
Stefan
Kinda like he was just like, I don't think it's cool that you're roasting startups and, for content.
And I was like, I don't think you watched the video because at the very beginning we said, we're
not roasting startups. We're just going through it based on what we think in this AI wave. Like,
I'm sorry that you felt roasted.
00:02:09:01 - 00:02:20:07
Stefan
And then, he was like, but I did like your feedback. We are trying to expand further because we
think Apple intelligence might kill us. So I was like, okay, well, not bad, but yeah, like he like
found me on LinkedIn.
00:02:20:08 - 00:02:21:29
Jens
That's what we said.
00:02:22:01 - 00:02:33:21
Stefan
Yeah. And so like, I don't know, I actually was having this debate the other day. I was talking
about Dax. So Dax posts you saw yesterday how the whole internet went down right?
00:02:33:24 - 00:02:48:12
Jens
Actually, I was on vacation. No, I didn't see, I didn't. It doesn't bother me, but it's interesting how
interconnected the world is. Like one one tiny glitch at Google and everything is broken.
00:02:48:15 - 00:03:09:28
Stefan
It was kind of funny, but, basically, if you saw on Twitter, the CEO of Planet Scale, he was kind
of just like, not roasting, but he jumped on the opportunity to roast neon a little bit because
Neon's downtime and, like, availability wasn't always the best during their time. And, obviously
our friend Dax, he jumped on the bandwagon a little bit.
00:03:10:00 - 00:03:35:29
Stefan
And, he was getting DMs from, like, the people that work there. And it got me thinking, is that I
don't know, you can you can help me explain this. Like developers get very attached to what
they build, to the point where it's like them, like they become the product. Like, I don't
understand it because they got really hurt that somebody said like, something kind of mean
about a product that they built.
00:03:35:29 - 00:03:50:27
Stefan
But I don't know, like, do you think developers get too attached to their code or to the things that
they build? Like you are not Cosmo. I'm not WunderGraph, even though sometimes we think we
are. But what's your take on that? I know this is off script, but I'm just kind of curious.
00:03:51:00 - 00:04:20:18
Jens
I think it's a big problem. It's so easy to get hurt. When for example, in in pull requests, you, you
write some code and then you get feedback to improve something, and you, you immediately
feel like emotionally attacked. I think that is something every developer goes through because
like, I hey, I wrote it. It's it's it's my code and, yeah, I, I think that's, that's the problem.
00:04:20:21 - 00:04:50:01
Jens
I also think, to be honest, if you're a startup and you, you get roasted, like what we did last
week, did you really start with, with, significant problem you're solving, like, you know, let's let's
be real. When I started WunderGraph in the very early days, it was just it was just, me and the
code, and it was like, hey, interesting problem.
00:04:50:01 - 00:05:14:07
Jens
I want to work on it. I want to solve it. It's fun. And you get super attached to the to the solution
by itself. But are you really solving, like a massive problem? I mean, we, you know, the the rest
of the story we figured out over the years that we were not solving the biggest problem. So, I
don't know, it's a tough one.
00:05:14:10 - 00:05:35:08
Stefan
It's tough. And like if you've ever read about like, Buddhism and, nihilism, what they try to say a
lot in it is like to remove your emotion from everything, just to detach from people, to detach
from products, things like that. And I wonder because, like, it makes sense, like you put your
hard work into something, you obviously become attached to it.
00:05:35:11 - 00:05:42:10
Stefan
You were attached, to WunderGraph SDK. You remember when we were shutting it down and
you you were you were affected a little bit by that.
00:05:42:12 - 00:06:06:27
Jens
Yeah, I, I was very much hurt, but, I mean, it's normal. You have an idea, you execute it. It's not
working the way you were hoping to. And it's it's kind of like your baby. So. Yeah. If, if now
someone comes around the corner and tells you, like, hey, Stefan, the landing page of Wunder
Graph it's it's garbage.
00:06:06:27 - 00:06:28:01
Jens
It's broken. It doesn't tell me anything, but, you know, like, I don't know, a few weeks ago, we
were we were talking about our landing pages, and we we said, like, okay, our landing page is
also not the greatest, but what we what we kind of figured out in retrospect is.
00:06:28:04 - 00:06:28:23
Stefan
For.
00:06:28:23 - 00:06:38:11
Jens
For, snitching, snatching for, for for snatching away Apollo customers. It's actually.
00:06:38:13 - 00:06:39:26
Stefan
Top notch.
00:06:39:28 - 00:07:07:02
Jens
It's it's the best. You you know, this is one of my biggest learnings when you are a small startup,
you might be thinking, too, that you want to behave like a big startup. And the the one big
learning for us was just, just accept that you're the small startup and just play the small startup
role, you know?
