summary: |
  Jens uses the bell curve meme to explain startup communication strategy - very early and very mature companies both focus on simple, direct messaging, while middle-stage companies often overcomplicate with grand vision statements. He reflects on WunderGraph's early tendency to lead with big vision rather than practical solutions, and how their approach has evolved to be more direct and problem-focused as they've matured.

Jens
When when we were like super, super small, I was like, okay, big vision. And we put the the
vision on top and we, we speak about the vision and we make it a big thing. And, it's, that's how
we communicate what we are and what what we solve. And now, by the way, Do do you know
this meme where on the left side, you have this dumb guy on the right side, you have the super
smart guy, and then the middle you have like, the bell curve.
00:07:35:04 - 00:07:36:14
Jens
Do you know this meme?
00:07:36:17 - 00:07:46:06
Stefan
Yeah, but it's the same guy on the on the left and the right. And then, like the the dumb guy. The
dumb guy? No. Is it. I know what you're talking about. Hold up. No.
00:07:46:06 - 00:07:54:03
Jens
You have, like, super dumb on the left side, and you have super smart on the right side. And
then the middle you have like everybody else.
00:07:54:05 - 00:07:56:19
Stefan
Yes yes yes yes yes I do.
00:07:56:21 - 00:08:22:18
Jens
So you know the dumb guy on the very left, he will be like, just say what your biggest competitor
does and make it open source because you're dumb. You have no fucking clue. So let's just say
like okay, we're doing. Yeah. Exactly this. So on, on the, on the left side, it's like just copy Apollo
okay. And then on the right side it's, it's also just copy Apollo.
00:08:22:18 - 00:08:24:01
Stefan
Oh yeah.
00:08:24:01 - 00:08:41:03
Jens
But look in the middle and in the middle it's like okay do some like super sophisticated hero
whatever. But the dumb guy and the super smart guy, it's it's really just. Okay. Apollo Federation,
open source and that's everything.
00:08:41:05 - 00:09:05:04
Stefan
I mean, this one does a perfect example. Like I just do whatever I feel like. I visualize my future,
make a ten year vision, set Smart goals, break those down into productive daily routines.
Discipline beats motivation and then I just do whatever I feel like Apollo Federation like it's kind
of funny. People overcomplicate things a lot. Like usually the simplest answer is the right
answer, but I really like that bell curve meme.
00:09:05:10 - 00:09:20:02
Stefan
And it does make sense. Like we got pretty attached to the things that we built. But it's human
nature, you know, devs build it, they feel close to. It's the same thing. If you build a house and
somebody comes, it's like, well, your house sucks, so I get it. But today we have a lot of topics
to discuss.
00:09:20:08 - 00:09:37:28
Stefan
Some of the topics we're gonna be discussing today is, Jens, I wrote a blog post on OpenAI and
GraphQL, so I'll share his post in a little bit. And this one was funny. I think we should start with
this one. This would be so funny to rant about because Apollo is breaking their own principles. I
want to talk about the principles of GraphQL and how Apollo is breaking them.
00:09:38:01 - 00:09:57:14
Stefan
That one's going to be an interesting one. This one I was pretty upset about, which was, some
stupid article from futurism.com. They said learn to code, is backfiring. And, there's a high
unemployment rate for computer science grads. Basically saying maybe learning to code is a
mistake. Computer science people should be wary. So we'll talk about that one.
00:09:57:17 - 00:10:16:06
Stefan
And then this was a cool post. That don't let an LLM dumb or dull your creative edge. It is
something I am seeing. A funny story. I sent a really good article, like it's maybe 50 pages, but
it's a fantastic article. And I to my friend, you know what he did? He used AI to summarize it for
himself.
00:10:16:06 - 00:10:28:05
Stefan
And I was like, dude, you're missing the whole point. Like, this is what the article is talking about
is that we're using AI to dumb ourselves when you should read the article. Like, can we not read
50 pages anymore? But we'll talk about that when we get to that.
00:10:28:07 - 00:10:35:28
Jens
You know that there was a time in the past when we were reading books, but nowadays we're
too lazy. We're just summarizing books.
00:10:36:00 - 00:10:46:18
Stefan
Okay, so I still read books, by the way, one of the best things you could possibly do. But let's
start with, the rant about Apollo. I think that one will keep the interested viewers.
00:10:46:18 - 00:11:01:08
Jens
But but, but by the way, just a question. Like at what stage should we stop ranting about Apollo?
Like is it is it becoming boring or.
