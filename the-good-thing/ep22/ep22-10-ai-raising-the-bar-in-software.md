Jens
But other than that I think AI hasn't changed much. There's there's a probability that one of the
underlying patterns for this article could be maybe in the past we hired too many developers, or
maybe, too many developers were interested into getting into this field. Even people who don't
really care, who just want to make money. And yeah, I think it's if you're if you're a good
developer, if you care about your, your craft, I think nothing really has changed except with
LLMS, you now have pretty awesome tooling that, solves boring problems and that makes us,
more efficient and lets us generate more output faster.
00:55:14:14 - 00:55:37:08
Stefan
You hit such a good point. So if you remember, during Covid, like 2020 to 2023, we called it the
ZIRP era. It was in, zero interest rate phenomenon. Like all these companies were raising crazy
money. Zoom exploded because of the pandemic. Companies like cameo and all these tech
companies exploded. They were hiring developers like mad during that time.
00:55:37:08 - 00:55:55:11
Stefan
The hottest thing that was available was bootcamps here in Miami. So many bootcamps spun
up where they would teach you a basic mern stack. You would learn react, Flask, and all of a
sudden you're a developer. I, I'm a developer, and they were cranking out developers like crazy,
and people were actually getting hired because people were just hiring for developers.
00:55:55:14 - 00:56:20:19
Stefan
And what I think actually happened is, ZIRP area went down 2022 to 2024 was kind of a dead
era for startups, was really hard to raise, and there was a lot of layoffs and it wasn't layoffs
because of companies doing bad. It was layoffs laying off the people that they hired in 2020 to
2023, which was not the best candidates because they were coming from just quick learning,
and they wanted to get into tech because there was this big boom.
00:56:20:22 - 00:56:38:15
Stefan
And I think what AI is doing is it's actually raising the bar, because you can do a lot with AI, but
there's also a lot you cannot do with AI because it's what you said LLMs, and it's based on the
feedback and the input that you give them. But it cannot reason. It cannot solve hard
architectural problems.
00:56:38:15 - 00:56:55:27
Stefan
It can't do what Dustin does. He can't do what David does. It can't do what you do when we talk
with these customers. And so I think AI is actually just raising the bar. Meaning if you're
interested in the technology, if you're interested and you love your craft and you're a good
developer, you will always have, employment opportunities.
00:56:55:29 - 00:57:04:06
Stefan
But I don't think AI is firing people or helping people out. I think it's still important to learn to
code. I think it's one of the best skills you could possibly learn.
00:57:04:08 - 00:57:40:14
Jens
I, I really like one of your points, like how you say it's raising the bar because I think there's a lot
of truth to it. If you think about it like five years ago, you would have gotten a job. If you can read
a JIRA ticket, like back then, it wasn't a linear ticket. It wasa JIRA ticket, but if you could read a
JIRA ticket and write HTML and JavaScript, or maybe you can write React to implement the
frontend code to do what the ticket states.
00:57:40:16 - 00:58:05:04
Jens
I think five years ago you would you would have gotten a job with this kind of skill set. And today
with LLMs, you can write a prompt and it will generate the react code. But if you give people like
a more complicated task, the people who could write this little bit of react, they would then fail.
So you're exactly right.
00:58:05:04 - 00:58:25:26
Jens
So the bar is now at a different level, like just writing a bunch of react that's you're not a
programmer anymore. That's what LLMS can do. If you want to be a programmer, you you need
to. Yeah, you need to be able to do, more, more high level, more complex stuff.
00:58:25:28 - 00:58:39:19
Stefan
Yeah. And, like, back then, if you could write a little bit of react, a little bit of stuff, very minimal.
In America, you can make a good salary 60 to 80,000 just starting just because like you write
little.
00:58:39:19 - 00:58:41:00
Jens
You had such, you know.
00:58:41:03 - 00:58:59:22
Stefan
That's what I'm saying. Like I was not very good at react. I knew a little bit of react. I had a
computer science degree and I was able to jump and get a degree or a job very quickly. Right
now with LLMs marketing people with zero knowledge can make changes to the website. They
can change react components, they can build their own react components.
00:58:59:22 - 00:59:19:27
Stefan
Might be a little bit trial or error, but the thing is, is developers are still going to be a very highly
paid field because the best developers cannot LLMs cannot do what the best developers do.
And so I stand by my point. I really think it's a good one is that the overall bar to enter into the
field has just gone up higher because of AI, and I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.
00:59:19:27 - 00:59:24:06
Stefan
I think it's actually quite a good thing because it pushes us to be even better.
00:59:24:09 - 00:59:49:02
Jens
Yeah, I mean, look at our tech stack, for example. It is super simple on our website like our
marketing website, it's a static website. You want to change the hero. Okay. Go to the, go to the
component that does the hero thing and then write some cursor stuff and tell cursor to change it
in some way, and it will do it.
00:59:49:02 - 01:00:44:21
Jens
It will be fine. But go go into Cosmo and like pick up one of the issues of one of our customers,
like real issues, like from enterprise customers where you have to touch a bunch of things back
end front end, maybe add a new index to clickhouse or whatever, and it quickly gets to a level of
complexity where an LLM can do absolutely nothing, where you have to coordinate with
different team members, and then you look into into analytics, like who's using that feature, etc.
like the whole process of software engineering is just so complex, like, and that's the thing
software developers, they are already like so busy coordinating with teammates, pull request
reviews, writing
01:00:44:21 - 01:01:17:05
Jens
the right tests, end to end tests, deployment, Kubernetes is like there's already like so many
problems. Like actually we're welcoming LLMs because they can help us like make one boring
thing writing code make that simpler. Because honestly, I think, by the way, you you can you can
unshare is but I think one of the, one of the big parts is that software engineering it is for me, it's
not so much about writing the actual code.
01:01:17:07 - 01:01:50:00
Jens
It's more about taking, taking, a feature requirement or taking requirements from customers and
figuring out what is a good architecture to do it. Is it even a good solution in the first place? So
it's about solution engineering. It's about working with the customer, figuring out like, how can
we do it? What is a great developer experience? One thing that a lot of people sayLLMs often
like it's taste like if you build something.
01:01:50:03 - 01:02:16:20
Jens
Yeah, do it in a way that's actually enjoyable. Like, you know, the software doesn't have to suck.
Build it in a way that's actually cool and easy to use, and that's that, helps the guy in the end
who's using the software to to get the job done, done faster. And like, there's so many things
once you have built it or even before you build it, you can think about, how can I educate him on
it?
01:02:16:21 - 01:02:37:01
Jens
How can I create content on a documentation? You need to properly document the feature.
What is the usability and like there's so many things. Then you have to to bring it into into a
sprint or you have Kanban. You have to prioritize things. When you prioritize things, you have to
coordinate with other team members, maybe with other teams.
01:02:37:03 - 01:03:02:15
Jens
It can affect one or more components in the stack. So you have to coordinate how to roll out and
everything. So again, like there's an infinite amount of problems, many of which LLM cannot
solve. And so yeah, I think every good developer will will welcome this current ongoing trend
with cursor and whatnot because it it makes our lives easier now.
