Stefan
Well said I think it's a great place and the podcast app. But guys if you're looking for a great job
and you're a great engineer and you want to work on some interesting problem, consider
working at wundergraph if we're growing. We're working on some very fascinating stuff. You're
very close with the customers and we welcome I. Everybody on the team uses AI, but if you're
relying on AI too much and you don't have the skills to back it up, this might not be the place for
you.
