Jens
Like obviously not. And I think we're we're the biggest innovators in the in the space actually. If you look at our blog wundergraph.com/blog, you will find, I don't know, 100 plus blog pro blog posts from myself and teammates, but mostly from myself about the topic of GraphQL and Federation. I think I'm the only person, or I'm the I'm the number one person.

00:04:09 - 00:04:29
Jens
And by the way, I'm not bragging at all like I'm. If you know me, I'm never someone like, I never put myself on a, like a podium or something. It's not what I do. I'm more like a tactful person, but I am. I'm number one person to write blog posts about GraphQL and Federation. Absolutely. Just by numbers.

00:04:29 - 00:05:02
Jens
So why would we not care about federation? Just recently we solved a very, very interesting problem together with eBay. eBay, I would say one of the biggest users in, GraphQL, and Federation. And they, they didn't just partner with us. They're not the customer. Not just the customer. They're also an investor. And what this relationship allows us to do is, first of all, we're building an open source implementation of GraphQL federation.

00:05:02 - 00:05:33
Jens
And people like, if you throw mud at us and you're like, oh, we're, we're doing cosmo connect, we're doing gRPC on the backend side, we're moving away from, from Federation. Then my first answer will be like, what do you mean by federation? Like what what what spec? And the reality is, there never was a spec. There will never be a spec currently because Apollo doesn't want a spec.

00:05:33 - 00:06:14
Jens
Apollo doesn't want competition. I think competition is amazing for the for the customer, for the for the market. And the other thing is, currently there's this composite schema working group. It's driven by chili cream people. And Apollo does a little bit of consulting. So the, the people who drive the space, is it Apollo. And then like before you throw mud at like like in a David versus Goliath style, why don't you just innovate and build better products so that nobody would actually care?

00:06:14 - 00:06:49
Jens
So to me, it looks like we're just such a strong competitor that it is now time to talk negatively about that. About us. And honestly, one of the policies we always had and I'm kind of I'm upset and I'm, I'm reconsidering this. But one of the policies, you can ask every single of our prospects when we're on, when we are on a sales call, we really try to avoid mentioning names of our competitors.

00:06:49 - 00:07:13
Jens
Just because we don't want to, to focus on on competition. We want to focus on on solving the customer problem. And it's kind of like unwritten rule for us. We we never go like, negatively against the competition. It's we we always focus on okay, customer. How can we help them. What what can we do. And it's just I don't know, it's it's a change in behavior.

00:07:13 - 00:07:47
Jens
We take note and our our take is to focus on customers, to focus on relationships with people like eBay. By the way, ask yourself, why is one of the biggest users of Federation? Why are they leaving the market leader? Why are they going with us building something open source together? And and what what is this relationship leading to?
