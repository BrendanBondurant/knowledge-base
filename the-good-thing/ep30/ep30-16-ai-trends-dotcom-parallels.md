Stefan
We are going to a bi monthly or every two weeks. But who knows maybe Jacob, if this keeps going we go back to every week. We'll see. But we should have some guest coming on to the pod but Jens. Anything from your end?

00:52:05 - 00:52:24
Jens
It yeah, we we have, 53 people currently on the stream, so it's, Jacob, David and Nithin, and then, 50 annoyed salespeople from Apollo. Our Stefan.

00:52:24 - 00:52:27
Stefan
Three just left, by the way. Three just left. Oh, you said that. Okay.

00:52:28 - 00:52:37
Jens
Yeah, that that that was too much. Stefan. Question for you. How how do you like, as a junior developer?

00:52:37 - 00:52:55
Jens
No. But for real, from from your perspective, I mean, you you ask quite a few questions. How how do you currently feel about the, the the climate and then what do you think about, like, API space versus AI space and how do you where do you see us in the next year?

00:52:55 - 00:53:19
Stefan
It's a great question. So like there's two hats from the founder point of view like the AI space. It's the only thing investors will talk about. I fundamentally believe I actually you told me this. So there's a great book that Jens recommended, which was The Rise and Fall of Empires. And what it means is that everything that's happening in your life a pandemic, a war or AI or a technology boom, it's already happened.

00:53:20 - 00:53:39
Stefan
You just weren't alive when it happened. And so you can see the rise and fall of empires through history by reading a lot of books and Jens recommended this book, and I read it. And one of the things I did as I pieced together the timeline of technology and when the internet came in, the 90s, like actually came, we had a.com boom, and it completely changed everything.

00:53:39 - 00:53:57
Stefan
And everybody knew that it was here to stay. But you also had the naysayers that were like, oh, it's just a fad. It's going to pass. If we go forward into history, we're going through the exact same thing right now. 90% of these AI companies are either going to get killed by OpenAI, or they're just not going to find product market fit after their initial boom.

00:53:57 - 00:54:16
Stefan
So we're in this period right now where everything's trying. What that means from the founder point of view is that money is cheap. If you're riding on that, boom. So AI is definitely something as a founder. But two, from a technology point of view, AI is going to make a difference. It's absolutely here to stay and it's going to make a difference into every single thing.

00:54:16 - 00:54:34
Stefan
For example, I was telling Jens today, I booked my flight for Gran Canaria by talking to somebody on WhatsApp. And it wasn't somebody. It was an LLM. Yeah, it was an LLM. They answered nearly. They booked my flight. They knew all my passport information. They booked. They're using my credit card. And it was done by texting my own personal concierge.

00:54:34 - 00:54:57
Stefan
So I think from an AI point of view, what we're building is super exciting, which translates to my next point on APIs. But AI from a founder point of view, if you want to get money, you have to do something with AI or at least wait until it crashes. But a very wise man once told me, he said with with fads or with trends, you either watch from the side or you join them, but don't go against them.

00:54:57 - 00:55:15
Stefan
And I typically think that's actually quite a true thing to say. So with the AI angle and the founders, I think it's important. And I really like the approach that we're taking with APIs. If you know about the space, it's it's tough. And I'll go actually one point because as a junior developer, AI has made my life so much better.

00:55:15 - 00:55:28
Stefan
So I'm building small projects on the side, and I can just talk to it in English. Like I made a stupid project and I put it on Hacker News, and I had a couple people sign up for it, and I was able to do that in 30 minutes just because I was just building something stupid. On the weekend.

00:55:28 - 00:55:48
Stefan
I was like, oh, okay. Like that's amazing. I think AI for a developer, it's a joy. Like all that boring monotone stuff that you would do now you can kind of automate and focus on the stuff that really matters, which is requirements engineering, context engineering, and thinking more about problems versus thinking more about the tools you're going to use, which is the code.

00:55:48 - 00:56:09
Stefan
And so I think from an engineering point of view, it's exciting. From our point of view with AIs and APIs. The API market is super weird, and I think we're probably the most uniquely positioned to disrupt. The reason why is if you look in the API space, the number one is Kong. That's for Rest APIs. But Kong is an old company if you don't know about their history.

00:56:09 - 00:56:31
Stefan
They came from mash API like I think 10 or 15 years ago, and they sold it and then they pivoted because they had this cool engine around the gateway, which was open source. There hasn't been an AI company or an API company in a while. You have these other kongs? competing in today. And I think this space, if you focus on collaboration, if you focus on, collaboration.
