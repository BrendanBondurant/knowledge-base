Stefan
Sorry, I said that one twice. But if you focus on that and if you focus on adding an AI angle and then three, if you focus on the graph underneath and connecting everyone's APIs together, I think we're in a very unique position about it. I really do, end of my monologue but Jens. What do you think? Do you agree with some of those points?

00:56:49 - 00:57:22
Jens
I agree 100%. And I would add one thing I think. So like you mentioned, we're we're in an absolute hype cycle of, of AI LLMs and we're, we're probably still haven't reached peak. But what I believe were the where the true winners will come out is if they don't, if they don't do like, like there will be like very, very few I would say shovel sellers like open AI.

00:57:22 - 00:57:53
Jens
But actually, for example, I think like the true winner will will probably be someone like Google because of Google with Gemini they are not burning cash or funding to to create Gemini. They have customers and what's, what's what's OpenAI currently is doing is they, they buy electricity for ten bucks and they sell it as ChatGPT for $1 or even less, I think.

00:57:53 - 00:58:15
Jens
I think they buy it for 20 bucks and sell it for one like it's 20 to 1 or something. It's absolutely crazy, how they lose money on every like every time you use ChatGPT openAI. They, they lose money because they, they want to take market share. And so, I think very, very few will survive on that end.

00:58:16 - 00:58:45
Jens
But where I see the true value and this is something where except us, I don't think like so many people invest into that topic. And I call it vertical integration. So instead of doing like, like models, AI, whatever, use AI in a vertical way. And by that what I mean is one of our biggest topics is API integration and API governance.

00:58:45 - 00:59:19
Jens
This is something where we currently build a whole product around, and we're leveraging AI for that product in a way that enables workflows that was never possible before. So that means we we take API design, API governance and collaboration. We take that to the next level through the use of AI. I still think like Federation is is a really good thing to to integrate APIs and to put AI on top.
