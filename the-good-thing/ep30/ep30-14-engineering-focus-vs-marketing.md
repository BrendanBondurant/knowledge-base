Jens
They add a feature, they market the hell out of it, but they never really complete the, the, the things. And yeah, it's a yeah, that's I don't know.

00:47:35 - 00:47:40
Stefan
What's funny is you had a little Freudian slip defer deburg  DeBergalis.

00:47:41 - 00:47:55
Jens
Defer derfbulous. So did you know that like a while ago, I did an interview with Matt debug of this. I have it still on on my camera. I never published it.

00:47:55 - 00:47:58
Stefan
Should we should we publish it? It was from GraphQL conf 2023, I think. Right.

00:47:59 - 00:48:40
Jens
I'm not sure like how, how interesting it is. It's it's in the vault. I have to say, I like I can differentiate it. Okay. So when when, when some people talk negatively about our company, I, I don't like that. And at the same time, I can respect Matt because I think he's a smart person and, and a good engineer and, yeah, we had we had conversations in the, in the past, not so many just, recently and, like, leadership at Apollo also changed, a little bit.

00:48:40 - 00:49:06
Jens
But, yeah, like, I in general, the I think the ethos inside WunderGraph is that we are a very engineering focused company. And, by the way, we have a lot of open roles, like very, very interesting roles. For example, you can you can help us work on, on, algorithms on improving the Federation tooling and everything.

00:49:06 - 00:49:38
Jens
But what I'm trying to say is, like, we're very engineering focused and we respect other engineers, like, we're we're probably not the best marketers or we're not known for our sales strategies or something. But in terms of engineering, the companies that work with us, we have very close relationships. When you are a customer, it is very rare that you don't talk to engineers, that you don't talk to founders.

00:49:38 - 00:49:59
Jens
Whenever a topic gets more interesting, it's typically like, I'm I'm the like the product owner of wundergraph. So I'm, I'm typically, involved. But if you don't know me I'm also like an engineer. Sometimes I, I code on wunder graph, but it's becoming less and less just because we have a lot of people and, and stuff to do.

00:49:59 - 00:50:44
Jens
And, everybody has a question but yeah. So we're, we're very engineering focused and we really respect engineers and yeah, I think, on on that you are my. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm testing for, for Nithin, for example, where we're working on, on on hub together actually next week we meet in, in Cologne. So if you're an engineer, if you want to join a rocket ship, if you want to, to, work with a cool crew of people like Nithin or David, and if you sometimes want to meet in person, then Wunder Graph is a is a really nice place to join.
