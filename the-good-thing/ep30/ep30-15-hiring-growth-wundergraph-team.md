Jens
Later this year, we will all meet in, in Gran Canaria, where we have our, our last retreat for this year. And then for next year, we have some very big plans. We just hired a field marketer, so we will be much more in person. We will come to to conferences and, we will have a lot to, to talk about.

00:51:06 - 00:51:23
Stefan
Cool. Well said, really want to emphasize on the hiring. So we're hiring all across roles. I know you said that we're stronger on engineering. Yes, I totally agree. We're an engineering first company, but we're hiring on the marketing because we want to improve and we're hiring on the sales team. So if you want to come join us, there's a lot of opportunity, a lot of pipeline for you guys to join us.

Stefan
But also on the engineering thing, there's so much ownership. One of the things I love about Wunder Graph is everybody owns something and you can come work with Nithin. And, I know he would love a little bit more help on hub, but okay, fantastic. And then the Jens I think I kind of covered to all my points.

00:51:40 - 00:51:54
Stefan
I mean, we, we went through every single thing. And I think you addressed it pretty well from your end. Do you have any questions or anything that you want to add? We have a quite a decent amount of viewers today. So guys, thank you so much for joining us this Friday morning. We're definitely going to keep it coming.
