Jens
I don't know Stefan I, I'm excited for next year and I'm excited for, for joining API conferences and talking about like, new concepts and, and, really, really helping people to design better APIs and, and to, to govern them, in better ways with, with great workflows. And ultimately, if you want to like I said earlier, if you want to enable AI, you need to have a well-designed API and it needs to be well documented and there needs to be meaning and use cases, otherwise AI can't do can't do anything with it.
