Jens
So it can also benefit from that, AI trend directly. But I think the, the real value is because, before the AI boom, we had people who wanted to do Federation, who wanted to have microservices because the company needs them to grow. And even if the whole bubble bursts, people will still have APIs, because if you go to the eBay website, you want to see listings.

00:59:47 - 01:00:12
Jens
And that has nothing to do with AI like Bubble burst or not, people will continue shopping or people will still go to SoundCloud and and do things there, or they will go to Paramount and and get info about sports or whatever. So all these things, they will continue. What's going to happen to AI? We don't know. What will AI cost in the future?

01:00:12 - 01:00:52
Jens
We don't know what what will happen to companies like OpenAI and their products when funding dries up. We don't know. But I can, I can I can tell you like 1,000%. In the future, you will have people who design APIs and who need better tooling for governance and collaboration. And that's what we're what we're focusing on. So there's I just recently saw a post from someone working for, Andreessen Horowitz, and they were asking on Twitter, if you're working on something super, super boring, I want to talk to you.

01:00:52 - 01:00:53
Jens
Oh, the enterprise one.

01:00:53 - 01:00:54
Stefan
I saw it too.

01:00:54 - 01:01:24
Jens
Yeah, yeah. And, collaborative API design. Microservice governance is probably one of the most boring things you can think of, like go, go to your friends and, tell them, like, it's a bit like, you know, PHP, like, you know, these, these guys with their with the Lamborghinis, who, who, who put on them, like, paid by, PHP.

01:01:24 - 01:01:27
Jens
But the point I'm trying to make is.

01:01:27 - 01:01:27
Stefan
Or graphql in the future.

01:01:27 - 01:02:00
Jens
A feature AI will peak and whatever, but, GraphQL Federation or more specifically, microservices APIs, collaborative schema design and governance, these kind of things stay. They will stay forever. And we're, we're working on on making them much, much, much better with AI. So I don't know, we're we're insanely excited for for that. And maybe the we will in some way benefit and ride the AI wave.

01:02:00 - 01:02:28
Jens
But even even if we don't at some point, I think, every company will need a strategy. How do we build APIs across ten, 20, 50, 100 teams? And currently I don't see anything that even comes close to Federation. And with what we're building today, I think, it, it will take it to the next level. So yeah.
