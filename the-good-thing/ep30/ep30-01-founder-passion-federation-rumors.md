00:00:24 - 00:00:36
Stefan
And we're alive. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing. As usual, we're a little bit late. I apologize. That was on my behalf. But again, I'm joined by Jens. Jens how are you doing today?

00:00:36 - 00:00:40
Jens
So when we don't have guests now, I am your special guest.

00:00:40 - 00:00:45
Stefan
Yeah. And then when we do have guests, you're just my guest. Yeah.

00:00:45 - 00:00:55
Jens
I like, do you know, like, who is it? Is it Jimmy Kimmel or someone they have, like this? This, the thing on the side, like, like a skeleton or what is it?

00:00:55 - 00:00:59
Stefan
Yeah, I forgot who it was. Don't. But he has the skeleton. It has a name?

00:00:59 - 00:01:00
Jens
Yeah. The skull.

00:01:00 - 00:01:01
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. That's you.

00:01:01 - 00:01:04
Jens
I'm. I'm your. I'm your skull.

00:01:04 - 00:01:17
Stefan
Yeah. I mean, when we don't have a guest for sure. But it's good to have you back on the show. We've been off for a little bit, so I apologize, but we're working on getting more guests, and we're going to be working on a better cadence with Jacob, so it's going to be awesome. We're going to keep going forward.

00:01:17 - 00:01:36
Stefan
We're doubling down on our content strategy. But I think today is going to be an interesting episode. I'm not as bubbly today because the reports of our demise as the name of the title have been greatly exaggerated. And honestly, one of my favorite things about being a founder and following other founders is how passionate they get.

00:01:36 - 00:01:53
Stefan
Like, you see Elon Musk yelling at Sam Altman on Twitter, or you see Guillermo yelling at the Replit founder, and people are like, oh, you're bigger than that. But I've always been a guy that passion is important. If you watch tennis, Novak Djokovic, gets upset, Cristiano Ronaldo gets upset. All the best players in the world get upset.

00:01:53 - 00:02:14
Stefan
And it's the same thing. And founders, because it's a high stakes game. And so recently there's been a lot of reports and I know Jens, he's a little bit less emotional than me, but if you piss him off, he comes in with the facts. Jens. Talk to me a little bit about what's been kind of been said in the community recently, especially around GraphQL Conf, and like the direction that we're going.

00:02:14 - 00:02:21
Stefan
It's a little bit upsetting. I'm not going to lie to you.

00:02:21 - 00:02:23
Jens

00:02:23 - 00:02:28
Stefan
He's trying to think of it as the most political way he could say.

00:02:28 - 00:02:39
Jens
I don't know. I'm, I, I'm, I'm typically ranting, but, how how would you put it? What what what was being said?

00:02:39 - 00:02:52
Stefan
Well, well, a little bit of backstory. So you guys know about Wunder Graph? We've been really focusing on Federation, and it's gotten to a point where customers are coming to us and like, wow, you really know your stuff. And you're like, oh, if you've been working on this since 2018, you think you would know. And we do.

00:02:52 - 00:03:09
Stefan
We love Federation. We love solving problems for our customers. And when you start to eat a little bit of the market share, sometimes people will look at you like a toy and they'll be like, oh, that's cute what they're doing over there. But then slowly that toy gets bigger and bigger and they start eating more and more and they get bigger customers.

00:03:09 - 00:03:32
Stefan
And then they go, oh my God, there's a threat. And so recently, Apollo has deemed us as a threat and has been just putting blatant lies, if you will, into the ecosystem saying things about us. We can talk about what happened at GraphQL conf, why we didn't go, why we're investing into federation. But basically the backstory is competitors have been saying that we're moving away from federation, which by the way, I think is ridiculous.

00:03:32 - 00:03:39
Stefan
But Jens, can you set the record straight? Are we moving away from Federation?
