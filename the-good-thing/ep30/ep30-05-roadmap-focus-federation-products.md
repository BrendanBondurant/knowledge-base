Jens
And we're we're I think the, the first federation. Solution that that supports it. It doesn't matter that we are the first or something that that's not the point. But the point is we're we're heavily investing. And yeah, instead of talking negatively about us, just be better. And I can assure you, the the reason we didn't go to the, to the, shit this monologue this long, but the reason we, we didn't go to the conferences, we recently really scaled the team and we were focusing on one on three very, very big projects.

00:12:31 - 00:12:54
Jens
And we had to make a very difficult decision. We, we, we just thought like, okay, it's it's not the right timing. Like this year, we had some, some projects that slipped a bit and then we our, our roadmap wasn't executed the way we, we wanted to, which was, to some degree was my mistake. And so, yeah, this year we, we just couldn't make it.

00:12:54 - 00:13:28
Jens
But I can assure you, three products are coming over the next couple of months. This will be, like, game changing. In the in the community, all products focus on on, GraphQL and Federation. And. Yeah. So apologies for not for not coming and for not sponsoring and doing more, but we didn't want to, distract the team and, yeah, that's that's where we currently are.
