00:13:31:26 - 00:13:58:01
Jens
And I know for myself, I'm also not an easy person. Like I, I care about stuff, I have opinions
and, I have opinion, experience and, I think if you want to build a successful startup and, and
the CEO is, is not weird in some way or crazy in some way, I don't think it's a, it's a good sign.
00:13:58:01 - 00:14:04:08
Jens
So yeah. Kudos to to Sam. He's he's building something great.
00:14:04:10 - 00:14:13:01
Stefan
I agree I do want to though see if we can find his tweet. But he just kind of roasted old.
00:14:13:08 - 00:14:14:20
Stefan
Where is that?
00:14:14:22 - 00:14:16:09
Jens
He roasts what
00:14:16:12 - 00:14:26:21
Stefan
whatever?
Where he roasts. Basically somebody is like, what's the difference between you and neon or
00:14:26:23 - 00:14:28:03
Stefan
Yeah.
00:14:28:06 - 00:14:48:21
Stefan
I mean, to be honest, though, like, uptime is a pretty tough thing. Like, it's really, really hard. I
mean, have you been seeing what's been happening with, like turso, like for the past couple of
months? They had some pretty bad outages. And then you have somebody like Sam check this
out.
00:14:48:24 - 00:15:13:03
Stefan
To the right it says people ask what's unique about the planet scale postgres product. Here's
one thing. This is a direct dig towards neon. But look at this, 100% uptime. Granted, it is from
April, but still in between April and July 2025, there have been neon outages. So I think also I'm
a fan. You do have to be intense as a founder, but this is pretty badass.
00:15:13:06 - 00:15:17:15
Jens
Do you know how you achieve that? Like, do you know what is behind this?
00:15:17:17 - 00:15:26:21
Stefan
A lot of hard work and dedication and great engineering, but that's all I could say to it. What is
it? Give us a little insight, context.
00:15:26:23 - 00:16:01:24
Jens
So I think what's crazy about this is you cannot achieve, this level of high availability if you are in
a single zone. Because there's always, like, glitches or something. So there's a lot of
engineering behind it. And then, I think platform engineering wise, they are they are pretty
decent. They, they have figured out like, I don't know how they how they are completely
redundant on like so many layers and then they, they obviously work on, on vitess.
00:16:01:24 - 00:16:34:08
Jens
So they, they merge changes, which also means they must have a pretty good workflow
process, whatever for testing, for bringing in changes like I think in general, there must be a very
good engineering culture because if you, if you don't have, like staging environments and
everything and then a lot of redundancy and good process for, for verification, of of code
changes and everything good testing then you would never see those numbers.
00:16:34:10 - 00:16:42:09
Stefan
You know what we should do? Note for Jacob. We should try to get Sam on the podcast and
just talk to him about, like, hard core engineering, like, what are you guys doing over at
planetscale?
00:16:42:09 - 00:16:43:06
Stefan
Yeah, would be.
00:16:43:06 - 00:16:51:22
Jens
Interesting. Like, what's what's behind this, this graph. Like what? How does a company need to
look like from the inside to achieve this?
00:16:51:25 - 00:17:09:13
Stefan
And I think the total headcount for them, I am. I could be wrong if someone could double check
for me, but I think it's like 40 or 50 people or like 40 or 50 engineers at least, which is to achieve
this. It's incredible. So official approval of Jens, stamp I approve. Yeah.
00:17:09:19 - 00:17:24:06
Jens
We we have an emoji in our slack. It's, colon impressed. And then we have a second one. It's
it's colon. Unimpressed. And both are a picture of me and it's the same picture.
00:17:24:09 - 00:17:34:24
Stefan
I mean it tells us the it's the German roots in there, but I love it. Let's get on to a little topic
though. That's not pretty happy. So this is pretty crazy.
00:17:34:24 - 00:17:41:18
Jens
We can also take the happy path first. So we talk about, someone leaving Vercel.
00:17:41:21 - 00:17:56:24
Stefan
Ahh ok. So let me bring up the tweet. Yes. All right. Hold up. But, give us a little bit of context. So
everybody knows this person. Just left vercel. So let me bring up the tweet so we can actually
see it. This is actually.
00:17:56:27 - 00:18:03:29
Jens
Pretty insane I would say he he redefined what, what, developer advocacy means, right.
00:18:04:01 - 00:18:24:26
Stefan
Well, so I had a weird opinion. So in 2021, I met a bunch of developer advocates. And I hated
that whole profession. Like, you just make to do apps, you just make, like, whatever you say. I'm
a developer, developer advocate. I just write blog post. I totally agree, I think Lee Robinson, like
what he did for Vercel, was insane.
00:18:24:28 - 00:18:37:13
Stefan
I think he was one of their most critical components. It's crazy to me that he's leaving, though.
Like, Vercel just did it like a series d. I think I can see them going for an IPO path, but intense.
00:18:37:15 - 00:18:39:02
Stefan
Yeah.
00:18:39:04 - 00:19:09:01
Jens
What do you think? I, I don't know, I have a lot a lot of respect for Lee. I think he, he did great
work. I think he, he helped a lot make Next.js what it is and to until a certain point I slowly start
to see some, some cracks in Next.js like this. There's some, some controversies now, like
Vercel moving back and forth, vercel moving more into AI and other things.
00:19:09:03 - 00:19:45:12
Jens
But overall, I think, yeah, Lee really has shaped what what we know today is like rep dev and
and, developer advocacy. So I think he did a great job, five years with Vercel. So that kind of
indicates, he might be fully vested. Another part is you would typically stay inside a company if
you if you're expecting to get, like, more shares or that you can significantly increase the value
of your shares.
00:19:45:14 - 00:20:08:15
Jens
It seems like this is not the case for for Lee. And maybe there's other opportunities. Maybe in
the in the AI space, I don't know. I could totally see how he's starting tomorrow with anthropic or
whatever. And I, I don't know what. Yeah. It seems like things are going well for him.
Congratulations on on this run.
