00:26:18:29 - 00:26:24:14
Jens
So I think these are these are big questions, Stefan. What are your thoughts?
00:26:24:17 - 00:26:43:27
Stefan
I'm just like kind of reading these comments, like when you have to give them like benefit of the
doubt, like they're, what, 25, 26, 27 like they're young guys for co-founders. They built this
rocket ship that's actually exploded. And then now, you know, they're trying to figure it out. How
much have they raised? They've raised over like I think a billion something in funding.
00:26:43:29 - 00:27:04:18
Stefan
You know, they're at like 500 million ARR I'm just confused with all with that many people and
success. Why wouldn't you like try to figure out the pricing test the AB, test it, take your time with
it. But three times in the span of a month they messed it up. I don't get it. I don't understand.
00:27:04:20 - 00:27:30:14
Jens
The the other question is the normal playbook would be you raise all that money, you capture
the entire market, and then you figure out the business model and it feels like they are like, I can
only imagine that they must be under extreme pressure to make these changes because, I don't
know, maybe they're losing so much money.
00:27:30:17 - 00:27:50:08
Stefan
You know, it's crazy. I was actually reading a blog post about this. Somebody said that this is the
new age of the tech is not there yet. So what that means is you raise a bunch of money and
your goal is to completely own the market, and then the product and the tech will get there. So
for example, cluley, cursor and icon, have you seen like you.
00:27:50:11 - 00:27:52:24
Jens
And you can close this if we're just talking.
00:27:52:26 - 00:28:15:05
Stefan
Yeah. So icon is this AI video generation for ads. Then you got cluley that cheating tool and then
you got cursor which is we raise a bunch of money, we completely own the market and then the
product and the tech will catch up. But you want to own the market first by being there first and
owning it with the money, which is what cursor could have done.
00:28:15:08 - 00:28:33:01
Stefan
But now, if you're reading the comments, they've already pissed off a lot of people and you have
open router, you have all these open source projects coming out. Now you have claude with the
API keys, everything. They're kind of killing their own market share, which is we've raised the
900 million. Why not just keep going and owning the market?
00:28:33:01 - 00:28:36:18
Stefan
I don't get it. I think you're right on that.
00:28:36:20 - 00:28:59:19
Jens
Yeah. You want to have the biggest market share. You want to have the best tech. So hire hire
the best people and improve the tech and and don't lose to alternatives. And with this behavior
they they push people away. I don't know this this can go really badly. Currently I see everybody
talking about like how they go to, to claude.
00:28:59:21 - 00:29:13:01
Jens
So they go to anthropic and correct me if I'm wrong, but anthropic has their own models and
cursor has no models. Does cursor have models?
00:29:13:04 - 00:29:25:24
Stefan
I don't think cursor has any models. I think that's what they raised the money for, was to build
their own models, which is going to be tough, especially in this climate right now. And like the
headstart these companies have, but they don't have their own models. I don't think so.
00:29:25:26 - 00:29:55:05
Jens
Yeah. My my prediction this will consolidate and the winner will be someone for example
Microsoft who has hardware who can offer copilot or agent coding at reasonable pricing. And
they will they will win this war like Microsoft has so much money. They they they can wait. They
don't have to make money tomorrow. They they can take a long term bet.
00:29:55:11 - 00:30:15:12
Jens
No problem. And, yeah, with this much pressure and this kind of behavior or like, I'm not sure
about the be the pressure, but I can only get the impression from, from the outside that if you if
you make these rushed price changes that, that push people away, then something is going
wrong inside.
00:30:15:15 - 00:30:33:10
Stefan
You know, it's crazy. And it just goes back to the social network or Facebook. Everyone's seen
that movie. I mean, just the story of Facebook's amazing, but do you remember very early on,
the business guy was like, we need to start making money. We need to start charging for ads.
And the guy was like, no, ads are uncool.
00:30:33:11 - 00:30:51:27
Stefan
You want to get as many people as you want onto the Facebook. No ads. And he did for years
and years and years and years. No ad. They didn't even have a business model. They brought
on that Sandy lady who's going to figure out the business model. But the goal was get
everybody on Facebook. I think they had a billion people on Facebook before they even started
to make money.
00:30:51:29 - 00:31:15:29
Stefan
And it's the same thing is they first owned the market. Cursor. I like what you're seeing right now
with Vercel or not vercel or so with, OpenAI. It's like they're bleeding money. That's why they're
raising so much, but they're going and trying to own the complete market. And what's crazy
about Microsoft with what you said is true is they're moving slowly on purpose, because one a
flip of a button and now they have AI code reviewers.
00:31:15:29 - 00:31:33:08
Stefan
Now every company built on like AI code reviewing is dead. Why? Because it's built into GitHub.
It's built into VS code. Second, they actually have the data centers. They actually can build their
own models. They can acquire companies that they want. So I think you're right, at the end of
the day, the guy from comma, he's really funny.
00:31:33:08 - 00:31:54:07
Stefan
Founder. He said there's five tiers in this AI or there's the companies that matter, which are
Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, whatever. And then you go one layer down and then you have the
OpenAI, the anthropic, the claudes, and then you go one layer down. He goes, these are the
useless companies you have, windsurf. You have these because they actually don't own
anything like they have no moat.
00:31:54:09 - 00:32:04:10
Stefan
They're just a middleman. And the the two layers above can demolish them at any point. It's it's
going to be interesting to see how this plays out in a couple of years.
00:32:04:13 - 00:32:44:16
Jens
I mean, they they have something they have distribution. Distribution can also be useful. But
you know, you know, the the, the you know, the graph slack versus teams like, you don't even
have need to have a, a better product. If you have the distribution, you can you can absolutely
win. But in this case, what it what it means is, I think it's it's, it's no comparison if you think about
the distribution of cursor versus vs code, like probably like vs code, I don't know, has so much
more market share.
00:32:44:19 - 00:33:14:09
Jens
And if, if they offer copilot for a reasonable amount and then let's say you, you buy Microsoft
products and you, you get let's say you, you buy a Microsoft license for 100 bucks and for five
for ten bucks more, you also get AI capabilities. So you you now pay 110 bucks and you get all
this stuff, you get teams and whatever, and the a zoom alternative and and blah, blah, blah and
all this bundled together.
