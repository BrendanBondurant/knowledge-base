Jens
And if you give people cursor, it means if I have the perfect spec for my frontend, and if I have
the perfect spec for my backend, okay, I can now build it a little bit faster, like it's it's not taking
like, three days anymore. It's just taking like one day or half a day. But the real the real problem
was coming to the spec, coming to okay, here's our design.
00:50:32:00 - 00:50:52:20
Jens
What API do we need? And then you have this API definition. What kind of server, which
services should own that that logic. How does how do we distribute that. Yes. And then task
management. Like how do I ensure that, I'm implementing all the, the right parts. Meanwhile
how can I unblock unblock frontend guys to to work on that.
00:50:52:23 - 00:51:16:19
Jens
So all these kind of problems and that's something we, we figured as a, as a company we, we
want to solve that. So we're currently building building a solution to help with this whole, journey.
And, yeah, I think that's that's pretty interesting. Stefan, what what are you what are your
thoughts on on what?
00:51:16:19 - 00:51:23:28
Jens
We're what we're currently building and and, what what kind of feedback did you get from the
from the market so far?
00:51:24:00 - 00:51:41:22
Stefan
Good question. But first, I remember one time I was talking to a very like he IPOd a company
very successful founder, and he started a new company. I was like, why are you starting a new
company like you IPO? You can do whatever you want in the world. And he's like, I wanted to
build this product because I think the world needs it.
00:51:41:26 - 00:52:02:10
Stefan
Not that I think it needs it, but the world must have it. It must have this product because I have
to. And it's like, he's like, I felt I was put on this earth to solve that problem. And as long as Ive
known Jens. But I fundamentally think that the product that we're building, it's not a we're doing
this to get rich, but it's a thing that we're building this product because the world needs this
product.
00:52:02:10 - 00:52:24:16
Stefan
It needs the end to end business platform product to build digital products or however we end
up wording it. And what I've seen in the calls is you might be having a rough day. You go into
this call, you show this new product, and when you're showing a new product, like your anxiety
is pretty high because you've taken something from your head, you've put it out there into the
world and you don't know if they'll understand it.
00:52:24:16 - 00:52:40:10
Stefan
You don't know if they'll get it. Sometime people are like, wait, what? But then somebody is like,
oh my God, you don't know how many times I've done this. You don't know how many tools I've
used to do this. And you're like, oh, okay. Like so they also have experience of pain, what I do,
and then somebody else is like, this is amazing.
00:52:40:13 - 00:52:57:01
Stefan
Do you have plans for this? And then you're like, yes. And then they're like, okay, how much?
And what you've quickly realized is like, Holy crap, somebody actually wants this. And it's, you
know, I think that's what's the joy of entrepreneurship is like that little thing is like a little rocket
booster. It's like a little like, you know, like shot of adrenaline.
00:52:57:01 - 00:53:19:01
Stefan
And then you go into another company and they're like, oh my God. I also have the same
problems as that other company. But they don't they don't know each other. They've never
spoken to each other, but they have the exact same problem and they start doing the exact
same thing. So what I've seen is right now with this product that we're building, it's it really is
beautiful, you know, just coming out of a creation and then having that, people use it and we're
going to be releasing it soon internally to our customers.
00:53:19:01 - 00:53:30:09
Stefan
time.
It's it's gonna be fantastic. Let's jump though, if you're okay with it. Because I do want to talk
about the last ten minutes, which is kind of relates to this new product, which is we're almost at
00:53:30:09 - 00:53:31:09
Jens
Right?
00:53:31:11 - 00:53:36:01
Stefan
hinting at it.
Do we have time to talk about it, or should we just keep talking about our new product and
00:53:36:03 - 00:53:37:11
Stefan
Where we can.
00:53:37:11 - 00:53:40:23
Jens
Talk next week about the other thing?
00:53:40:25 - 00:54:03:14
Stefan
But Jens, if you can, without giving too much, like what was the biggest issue that you saw with
these companies like and also like how did you see it like when everyone knows our history, we
were about to die. We pivoted into Federation, we exploded. Everything's going great. But that
was never the end goal. The goal was never to stay there.
00:54:03:14 - 00:54:09:15
Stefan
Like, how did you see it?
00:54:09:18 - 00:54:13:06
Jens
So it was like two years ago and we were.
00:54:13:06 - 00:54:16:01
Stefan
Building we we.
00:54:16:01 - 00:54:32:19
Jens
We, we built the Wonder Graph SDK, which is a back end for front end framework. That was
kind of like my invention, I wouldn't really say invented. By the way, you keep pumping against
your microphone. You need you really need to stop doing that.
00:54:32:21 - 00:54:33:19
Stefan
But okay.
00:54:33:19 - 00:54:35:15
Stefan
It's my mic when I go here.
00:54:35:18 - 00:54:58:13
Jens
Yeah, it's it's that. Okay. So we were building on the graph SDK, the backend for front end thing.
And was my invention. I really liked it. Everybody liked it. Nobody wanted to pay for it. Long
story short. This this was a great product. And, it didn't help us to build a great company. Okay.
So.
00:54:58:15 - 00:54:59:25
Stefan
Yeah, we.
00:54:59:28 - 00:55:18:00
Jens
We were running out of money. We still had, like, I don't know, like half a year or something. Left
four five, so. Okay. Like two, two and a half years ago we, we said okay, pivot. What what are
we pivoting. And it was it was very funny. It was like Stefan he had like, he had like a black
notebook.
00:55:18:01 - 00:55:21:01
Jens
No, like a real notebook. Do you have it still?
00:55:21:03 - 00:55:31:19
Stefan
So is it a pandemic? No, no, no, no, it's not The Notebook. But I buy the same notebook and I
write all my notes and thoughts in. Okay, I have here on my bookshelf just six of them. The one
that I had is there.
00:55:31:20 - 00:55:33:13
Jens
You have the old one still.
00:55:33:15 - 00:55:35:09
Stefan
Yeah. Good one. So. Okay.
00:55:35:14 - 00:55:39:09
Jens
Yeah. You we don't need it. It's it's fine, but okay.
00:55:39:11 - 00:55:40:28
Stefan
00:55:41:01 - 00:55:43:28
Stefan
But it's more fun if I bring it because, look.
00:55:44:00 - 00:55:44:17
Stefan
So.
00:55:44:20 - 00:55:46:26
Stefan
Much notebooks.
00:55:46:28 - 00:55:48:24
Jens
I thought it was black. Was it not.
00:55:48:24 - 00:55:49:18
Stefan
Black?
00:55:49:20 - 00:55:51:13
Stefan
No its red.
00:55:51:15 - 00:55:52:19
Jens
Okay. Right. But.
00:55:52:19 - 00:55:55:05
Stefan
So we had this notebook. We were. We were on.
00:55:55:05 - 00:56:21:03
Jens
The retreats in the Netherlands on, old sheep farmhouse, and we were like, okay, we're fucked.
This is over. We need to pivot. And then Stefan opened the like, you know, we were all sitting
around. We were all all sad, and the mood wasn't great. And Stefan was opening his notebook
and he was like, okay, let me see what what what kind of notes I have.
00:56:21:05 - 00:56:44:17
Jens
And he he figured out that a bunch of people ask us, about open source Apollo Federation
alternative, and, Yeah. So. Okay, well, what are you going to do? So we had some money left,
some runway left. We were too many people. So we we had to, to part ways, part ways with,
with a bunch of people.
00:56:44:17 - 00:57:07:07
Jens
Unfortunately. And then we built cosmo. That's like two years ago or something. And, shortly
after I was on, on, a summer vacation with the with the family. And what what typically happens
is when I'm. when I'm on a vacation, I move out of the day to day business, and, I can never
stop thinking about WunderGraph.
