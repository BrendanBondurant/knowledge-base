00:20:08:15 - 00:20:13:09
Jens
I think, he did pretty well. Yeah.
00:20:13:12 - 00:20:18:00
Stefan
Like, does he get to get the stamp? Does he get the stamp of approval?
00:20:18:02 - 00:20:19:18
Jens
Absolutely.
00:20:19:20 - 00:20:20:11
Stefan
Yeah.
00:20:20:13 - 00:20:39:27
Stefan
I also want to go through his blog post. So I think it's got some good stuff into here. For
example, go hard at work and go home. So he talks a little bit here about like, going hard at
vercel and he has pictures. This one is really cool. Everything can be done faster. I really, really,
really like this one.
00:20:40:03 - 00:20:40:21
Stefan
What would you say?
00:20:40:22 - 00:20:43:06
Jens
I think he also has a kid now right?
00:20:43:08 - 00:20:48:20
Stefan
Yeah. He also has a kid.
00:20:48:22 - 00:20:55:13
Stefan
Yeah. This one I like. Everything can be done faster. Scale or die trying.
00:20:55:15 - 00:21:02:03
Stefan
Pretty cool. This is a great one. He's got some good stuff into there.
00:21:02:05 - 00:21:04:01
Stefan
Yeah.
00:21:04:04 - 00:21:16:00
Stefan
Guys, I recommend reading. I will drop it below into the notes. But congratulations Lee. I'm
excited to see where he goes. How much you want to bet he goes to an AI company? Should
we bet?
00:21:16:02 - 00:21:23:06
Jens
It in this climate. So maybe he leaves tech. Maybe he starts a farm.
00:21:23:09 - 00:21:23:25
Stefan
Yeah.
00:21:23:28 - 00:21:26:24
Jens
Or he goes into AI.
00:21:26:27 - 00:21:37:24
Stefan
I think he goes to AI. I think he's going to go to OpenAI anthropic. Maybe. Cursor. He'll probably.
How much do you want to bet? He goes to cursor.
That that's that's a problem with cursor. Like it's not the the most liked company at the moment
00:21:37:26 - 00:21:46:07
Jens
anymore.
00:21:46:08 - 00:21:50:23
Stefan
Good, good. Transition. Good transition. So let's say that we.
00:21:50:27 - 00:21:54:12
Jens
We we didn't plan this transition. It happened.
00:21:54:14 - 00:21:58:05
Stefan
Yeah. We didn't. So yepJens is right. Let me bring up the article by.
00:21:58:05 - 00:22:05:20
Jens
The way Jacob. The the the Good Thing logo sits on top of the Stefan's, name.
00:22:05:22 - 00:22:08:26
Stefan
Well, once I start sharing it, if it goes to normal.
00:22:08:29 - 00:22:12:04
Jens
Then, then it moves to the right. Yeah. That's correct.
00:22:12:07 - 00:22:13:24
Stefan
Oh. There we go.
00:22:13:26 - 00:22:16:11
Jens
See? It's improving.
00:22:16:14 - 00:22:17:27
Stefan
Magic.
00:22:17:29 - 00:22:34:06
Stefan
And get rid of this stupid ad. Okay, so walk me through what happened. You brought it up, I saw
it, I was messing around with cursor this week, but basically, they just kind of change their
pricing and just kind of, like, missed a lot of things up. But I think.
00:22:34:09 - 00:22:35:21
Jens
Not once.
00:22:35:23 - 00:22:39:16
Stefan
Twice walk us through what happened.
00:22:39:18 - 00:23:04:03
Jens
Yeah. There, there's, I think there's a Reddit thread. It describes it best and we have the Reddit
link somewhere and let's go to that. So essentially there, there was like, there was an unlimited
plan or like a pro plan and somehow it wasn't really unlimited. And suddenly it was like 500
requests in a month, and then it was like 200 something requests in a month.
00:23:04:03 - 00:23:29:07
Jens
And then, yeah, they kept changing pricing and everything. And, I think it's it's pretty interesting
because it, it shows two topics or this like two, two threats I would talk about. One threat is, I
had a discussion a while ago with the VC and we were talking about, okay, you're bringing up
something that's. Take a look.
00:23:29:10 - 00:24:01:04
Jens
Cursor. Okay. We missed the mark. Yes, but they they they, they kind of missed it multiple times.
Go to the second post. Second answer maybe. I don't know. Here. Okay. GitHub copilot gives
you 300 sonnet requests for ten bucks. And you have 20 bucks. And then you get something
like 40 requests in five hours or every five hours.
00:24:01:06 - 00:24:26:04
Jens
So there's cracks in the business model and, cursor. They raised a lot of money. And coming
back to the, to the two threats. Yeah. Here, this this is interesting. They had like 225, sonnet
calls and then they, they kept changing it and it, it was a whole mess. And I think what's, what's
interesting to observe here is two things.
00:24:26:04 - 00:25:01:23
Jens
So I had this discussion a while ago with a VC and the VC said, and I think this is also,
something Marc Andreessen said that, bad founders in a good market is still good. And good
founders in a bad market is bad and things like that. Yeah. And my point is, I think what we're
currently seeing is that we have, like, founders with very weird behavior in a good market, and
they keep changing the, the licenses.
00:25:01:29 - 00:25:24:03
Jens
And, it's possible that that they that they really harmed the company with that kind of behavior.
And the second part is, in the in the beginning, there was like a lot of talk about how Curser is
just an AI wrapper and they don't have a moat and so on, so forth. And now it seems like they
are under pressure.
00:25:24:03 - 00:25:52:14
Jens
It seems like they they are not really figuring out the business model. They are. They are
tweaking it. And it. I think there's a lot of evidence that behind the scenes, something is going
really, really badly. And they they tried to figure out how can they make money. And it seems like
it's it's currently tough for them. I know that VCs pump a lot of money into, into, AI coding tools.
00:25:52:16 - 00:26:18:29
Jens
Like, anthropic, for example. My, my big question is what is the real cost of an AI coding tool?
And can we justify, the, the margins and everything, like in the long term will, will it to like first or
will it actually work? Or is the business model so broken that if, if, VC money goes dry then it
doesn't work anymore.
