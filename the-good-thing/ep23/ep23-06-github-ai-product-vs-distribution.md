Jens
And now there's like a startup and they want to sell you AI coding for 50 bucks. And then the
CFO will be like, guys, we have 10,000 employees. It's not gonna happen. We already have
Microsoft. You will use VS code and that's it. Well, end of story.
00:33:32:25 - 00:33:48:15
Stefan
I always go back to this because a lot of people are always like used to build a following first
and then you should build a product. Distribution is key, distribution is key. And I kind of disagree
with that because like if you look back at all the best founders, they didn't have a huge Twitter
profile. They didn't have a lot of followers.
00:33:48:15 - 00:34:14:23
Stefan
Jeff Bezos was a nobody. Elon Musk was a nobody, Peter Thiel, nobody. Every great founder,
they didn't have a following. And the same thing with Microsoft is they have distribution now. But
they had the best product before. Like I think you have to fundamentally build a good product.
OpenAI eight years they spent building a product. Sam Altman had a following, and he didn't
even talk about it because he spent all his time on product.
00:34:14:23 - 00:34:31:29
Stefan
I think at the end of the day, I will always maybe I'll change my opinion in a couple of years. But
for me, I think companies that are building this distribution in this model, it doesn't work out
because at the end of the day, you actually have to have the best product. I mean, the best
example that let's talk about neon and planet scale, like neon had crazy distribution.
00:34:31:29 - 00:34:43:05
Stefan
People love what they were doing or whatever, but planning skills to better product. And now it's
absolutely crushing. So I don't know, I'm more on the product side. I think the product is more
important than the distribution. Distribution matters later.
00:34:43:07 - 00:34:53:24
Jens
But but you know, you, you you kind of made a counter argument to yourself because neon did
an exit for over a billion. And what did Planet Scale do?
00:34:53:26 - 00:35:07:20
Stefan
Well, they made an exit in stock to a billion, and that's at data bricks or whatever. And we also
don't even know if it was cash. We don't even know if it was a successful like an exit. We don't
know that planet scale was profitable.
00:35:07:20 - 00:35:10:12
Jens
Would you take Microsoft stock.
00:35:10:15 - 00:35:12:18
Stefan
No, it's, it's Databricks.
00:35:12:20 - 00:35:15:13
Jens
Is it Databricks I thought Microsoft.
00:35:15:16 - 00:35:19:18
Stefan
No, Microsoft invested into them, and then Databricks acquired them.
00:35:19:21 - 00:35:21:15
Jens
Oh, I see, okay.
00:35:21:18 - 00:35:34:21
Stefan
But it depends. It depends on, like, what you consider success. Like planet scale eventually
could IPO and it could be a public company and they built a better product. The VC game is
weird for me. I just think product is better, which is weird because you're a product guy. I thought
you would agree.
00:35:34:24 - 00:36:04:20
Jens
But you know, it's also interesting because planet scale also has a risk. They have risky
investment. So at some point there needs to something needs to happen either like and I don't
see planet scale going IPO. I don't think they will have that level of revenue. So it must be an
acquisition. But I'm not sure who who would acquire those.
00:36:04:23 - 00:36:06:11
Stefan
Good point.
00:36:06:13 - 00:36:26:28
Jens
We need to see how old planet Scale is and when was the last round. Because like after a
couple of years, investors want to want to get returns. But I would have to dig into like who are
the lead investors and what's the behavior. And then then you can kind of see what's going to
happen with planet scale in the future.
00:36:27:00 - 00:36:40:04
Stefan
Yeah. And to kind of add to this hold up, I think this is great, man. We are like on like our, what is
it called, our transitions. Our segments are pretty good. Check out what the next topic is.
00:36:40:06 - 00:36:42:01
Jens
What's the next topic?
00:36:42:03 - 00:36:42:21
Stefan
It's so funny.
00:36:42:21 - 00:36:44:18
Jens
I don't even know.
00:36:44:21 - 00:37:07:03
Stefan
So it talks about what we've been talking about distribution versus product. Speaking of that,
check out what just VSCode. Just added. So now you can drop a cloud. Sonnet four and cloud
opus four now available on GitHub copilot. So they've already started distributing out to VS
code. And they're doing this on purpose. If you already saw you can now get AI code review
within GitHub.
00:37:07:03 - 00:37:24:05
Stefan
Microsoft owns GitHub. They own the biggest place that all developers are. You are a
developer. If you're on GitHub. They've already started this, I would say I don't know. I would
say this stomping is what they're going to start doing is crushing these AI companies. Have you
read the blog post? What do you think about it?
00:37:24:08 - 00:37:32:12
Jens
But this means, you can use claude in VS code, correct?
00:37:32:12 - 00:37:34:04
Stefan
Yeah. They added an extension.
00:37:34:06 - 00:37:36:22
Jens
Which is good for anthropic, right.
00:37:36:25 - 00:37:41:21
Stefan
Good for anthropic, yes. And good for Microsoft as well.
00:37:41:23 - 00:38:11:06
Jens
I mean, I think, I think, I think GitHub makes, makes a smart move here or Microsoft in general
with copilot because they, they don't have their own models. They just leverage their
distribution. And they, they bring all the good models they have contracts with, with the good
providers like Gemini, open AI and claude. I don't know, it's it's pretty smart.
00:38:11:08 - 00:38:31:18
Jens
I mean, GitHub has another problem because there's now there's this discussion going on
between the CEO of GitHub who posts on Twitter that, developers are not going away. And I
think that's a, that's a pretty controversial thing because, you know, like.
00:38:31:20 - 00:38:33:12
Stefan
CEO of.
00:38:33:15 - 00:39:06:00
Jens
GitHub says that developers like AI will not kill developers. Obviously it is what this person has
to say. Otherwise he would harm GitHub because GitHub is a tool for for devs. I'm I'm super
curious what what direction GitHub is, is going on on the long term, like my, my personal opinion
and I, I don't know, I, I have a, I have a limited, limited knowledge in the field.
