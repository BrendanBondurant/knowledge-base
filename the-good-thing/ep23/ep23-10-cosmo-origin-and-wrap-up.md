Jens
So I don't know if I'm. If I'm not dead I'm thinking about WunderGraph. Probably, sometimes
about the family, but, most, most of the time, I, I don't know, I the head just can't stop thinking,
okay. So. And two years ago, I was on summer vacation with the family, and I had to I had an
idea.
00:57:28:04 - 00:57:40:25
Jens
I called Stefan, and I said, Stefan, we will make Cosmo open source. it's a stupid idea, but we
have to, because if we don't do it, someone else will do it.
00:57:40:27 - 00:57:42:09
Stefan
So we just we.
00:57:42:09 - 00:58:09:19
Jens
Just make it open source. And I still remember how I said, we make this thing open source. We
get momentum. And once we have momentum, we we will figure out the next step. I cannot tell
you today what this next step will be, but if we get enough traction, if we get enough customers,
we will learn something. We will figure out something, and that will help us then build the the
next step.
00:58:09:19 - 00:58:32:29
Jens
And it's like, you know, like it's like building a rocket ship. You know, you have like one stage it
lifts you in the air. And then, you have to have a second stage that that lifts you somewhere
else. The only problem with a startup, you don't have stages. You just have your one stage. And
you you really have to hope that's burning your first stage.
00:58:33:06 - 00:58:41:26
Jens
You figure out something to create the second stage because otherwise. Yeah, true. You had a
startup.
00:58:41:29 - 00:58:56:03
Stefan
No. It's a it's beautiful. We are almost at time. So, guys, we'll talk a little bit more next week.
We're going to be back regularly. Jens might be going on vacation in August. Me too. So we
may have some delays there, but we'll figure it out. Jacob, let's really try to get Sam on the
podcast.
00:58:56:03 - 00:59:10:15
Stefan
I'll connect you with a couple people. We should bring a really cool guest on here and talk
hardcore tech Jens. I'm happy we're back. I missed the podcast. I missed this conversations. I
missed the story. We do have a meeting we need to run to. But guys, thank you so much for
joining us today. Yes they were they were cursor.
00:59:10:15 - 00:59:22:13
Stefan
I barely knew her. And of course David with the banter. Guys, thank you so much. Have a great
weekend and we will see you next. Oh wait. Just kidding. Wait. Yeah, actually, no. What's the
good thing?
00:59:22:16 - 00:59:25:15
Jens
What's the good thing? Oh, we're we're back next week.
00:59:25:17 - 00:59:26:15
Stefan
You see, it's been.
00:59:26:17 - 00:59:28:21
Stefan

00:59:28:24 - 00:59:29:22
Stefan

00:59:29:24 - 00:59:35:23
