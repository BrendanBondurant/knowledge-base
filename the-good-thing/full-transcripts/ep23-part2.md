00:28:36:20 - 00:28:59:19
type: podcast-chunk
Jens
Yeah. You want to have the biggest market share. You want to have the best tech. So hire hire
the best people and improve the tech and and don't lose to alternatives. And with this behavior
they they push people away. I don't know this this can go really badly. Currently I see everybody
talking about like how they go to, to claude.
00:28:59:21 - 00:29:13:01
Jens
So they go to anthropic and correct me if I'm wrong, but anthropic has their own models and
cursor has no models. Does cursor have models?
00:29:13:04 - 00:29:25:24
Stefan
I don't think cursor has any models. I think that's what they raised the money for, was to build
their own models, which is going to be tough, especially in this climate right now. And like the
headstart these companies have, but they don't have their own models. I don't think so.
00:29:25:26 - 00:29:55:05
Jens
Yeah. My my prediction this will consolidate and the winner will be someone for example
Microsoft who has hardware who can offer copilot or agent coding at reasonable pricing. And
they will they will win this war like Microsoft has so much money. They they they can wait. They
don't have to make money tomorrow. They they can take a long term bet.
00:29:55:11 - 00:30:15:12
Jens
No problem. And, yeah, with this much pressure and this kind of behavior or like, I'm not sure
about the be the pressure, but I can only get the impression from, from the outside that if you if
you make these rushed price changes that, that push people away, then something is going
wrong inside.
00:30:15:15 - 00:30:33:10
Stefan
You know, it's crazy. And it just goes back to the social network or Facebook. Everyone's seen
that movie. I mean, just the story of Facebook's amazing, but do you remember very early on,
the business guy was like, we need to start making money. We need to start charging for ads.
And the guy was like, no, ads are uncool.
00:30:33:11 - 00:30:51:27
Stefan
You want to get as many people as you want onto the Facebook. No ads. And he did for years
and years and years and years. No ad. They didn't even have a business model. They brought
on that Sandy lady who's going to figure out the business model. But the goal was get
everybody on Facebook. I think they had a billion people on Facebook before they even started
to make money.
00:30:51:29 - 00:31:15:29
Stefan
And it's the same thing is they first owned the market. Cursor. I like what you're seeing right now
with Vercel or not vercel or so with, OpenAI. It's like they're bleeding money. That's why they're
raising so much, but they're going and trying to own the complete market. And what's crazy
about Microsoft with what you said is true is they're moving slowly on purpose, because one a
flip of a button and now they have AI code reviewers.
00:31:15:29 - 00:31:33:08
Stefan
Now every company built on like AI code reviewing is dead. Why? Because it's built into GitHub.
It's built into VS code. Second, they actually have the data centers. They actually can build their
own models. They can acquire companies that they want. So I think you're right, at the end of
the day, the guy from comma, he's really funny.
00:31:33:08 - 00:31:54:07
Stefan
Founder. He said there's five tiers in this AI or there's the companies that matter, which are
Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, whatever. And then you go one layer down and then you have the
OpenAI, the anthropic, the claudes, and then you go one layer down. He goes, these are the
useless companies you have, windsurf. You have these because they actually don't own
anything like they have no moat.
00:31:54:09 - 00:32:04:10
Stefan
They're just a middleman. And the the two layers above can demolish them at any point. It's it's
going to be interesting to see how this plays out in a couple of years.
00:32:04:13 - 00:32:44:16
Jens
I mean, they they have something they have distribution. Distribution can also be useful. But
you know, you know, the the, the you know, the graph slack versus teams like, you don't even
have need to have a, a better product. If you have the distribution, you can you can absolutely
win. But in this case, what it what it means is, I think it's it's, it's no comparison if you think about
the distribution of cursor versus vs code, like probably like vs code, I don't know, has so much
more market share.
00:32:44:19 - 00:33:14:09
Jens
And if, if they offer copilot for a reasonable amount and then let's say you, you buy Microsoft
products and you, you get let's say you, you buy a Microsoft license for 100 bucks and for five
for ten bucks more, you also get AI capabilities. So you you now pay 110 bucks and you get all
this stuff, you get teams and whatever, and the a zoom alternative and and blah, blah, blah and
all this bundled together.
00:33:14:15 - 00:33:32:23
Jens
And now there's like a startup and they want to sell you AI coding for 50 bucks. And then the
CFO will be like, guys, we have 10,000 employees. It's not gonna happen. We already have
Microsoft. You will use VS code and that's it. Well, end of story.
00:33:32:25 - 00:33:48:15
Stefan
I always go back to this because a lot of people are always like used to build a following first
and then you should build a product. Distribution is key, distribution is key. And I kind of disagree
with that because like if you look back at all the best founders, they didn't have a huge Twitter
profile. They didn't have a lot of followers.
00:33:48:15 - 00:34:14:23
Stefan
Jeff Bezos was a nobody. Elon Musk was a nobody, Peter Thiel, nobody. Every great founder,
they didn't have a following. And the same thing with Microsoft is they have distribution now. But
they had the best product before. Like I think you have to fundamentally build a good product.
OpenAI eight years they spent building a product. Sam Altman had a following, and he didn't
even talk about it because he spent all his time on product.
00:34:14:23 - 00:34:31:29
Stefan
I think at the end of the day, I will always maybe I'll change my opinion in a couple of years. But
for me, I think companies that are building this distribution in this model, it doesn't work out
because at the end of the day, you actually have to have the best product. I mean, the best
example that let's talk about neon and planet scale, like neon had crazy distribution.
00:34:31:29 - 00:34:43:05
Stefan
People love what they were doing or whatever, but planning skills to better product. And now it's
absolutely crushing. So I don't know, I'm more on the product side. I think the product is more
important than the distribution. Distribution matters later.
00:34:43:07 - 00:34:53:24
Jens
But but you know, you, you you kind of made a counter argument to yourself because neon did
an exit for over a billion. And what did Planet Scale do?
00:34:53:26 - 00:35:07:20
Stefan
Well, they made an exit in stock to a billion, and that's at data bricks or whatever. And we also
don't even know if it was cash. We don't even know if it was a successful like an exit. We don't
know that planet scale was profitable.
00:35:07:20 - 00:35:10:12
Jens
Would you take Microsoft stock.
00:35:10:15 - 00:35:12:18
Stefan
No, it's, it's Databricks.
00:35:12:20 - 00:35:15:13
Jens
Is it Databricks I thought Microsoft.
00:35:15:16 - 00:35:19:18
Stefan
No, Microsoft invested into them, and then Databricks acquired them.
00:35:19:21 - 00:35:21:15
Jens
Oh, I see, okay.
00:35:21:18 - 00:35:34:21
Stefan
But it depends. It depends on, like, what you consider success. Like planet scale eventually
could IPO and it could be a public company and they built a better product. The VC game is
weird for me. I just think product is better, which is weird because you're a product guy. I thought
you would agree.
00:35:34:24 - 00:36:04:20
Jens
But you know, it's also interesting because planet scale also has a risk. They have risky
investment. So at some point there needs to something needs to happen either like and I don't
see planet scale going IPO. I don't think they will have that level of revenue. So it must be an
acquisition. But I'm not sure who who would acquire those.
00:36:04:23 - 00:36:06:11
Stefan
Good point.
00:36:06:13 - 00:36:26:28
Jens
We need to see how old planet Scale is and when was the last round. Because like after a
couple of years, investors want to want to get returns. But I would have to dig into like who are
the lead investors and what's the behavior. And then then you can kind of see what's going to
happen with planet scale in the future.
00:36:27:00 - 00:36:40:04
Stefan
Yeah. And to kind of add to this hold up, I think this is great, man. We are like on like our, what is
it called, our transitions. Our segments are pretty good. Check out what the next topic is.
00:36:40:06 - 00:36:42:01
Jens
What's the next topic?
00:36:42:03 - 00:36:42:21
Stefan
It's so funny.
00:36:42:21 - 00:36:44:18
Jens
I don't even know.
00:36:44:21 - 00:37:07:03
Stefan
So it talks about what we've been talking about distribution versus product. Speaking of that,
check out what just VSCode. Just added. So now you can drop a cloud. Sonnet four and cloud
opus four now available on GitHub copilot. So they've already started distributing out to VS
code. And they're doing this on purpose. If you already saw you can now get AI code review
within GitHub.
00:37:07:03 - 00:37:24:05
Stefan
Microsoft owns GitHub. They own the biggest place that all developers are. You are a
developer. If you're on GitHub. They've already started this, I would say I don't know. I would
say this stomping is what they're going to start doing is crushing these AI companies. Have you
read the blog post? What do you think about it?
00:37:24:08 - 00:37:32:12
Jens
But this means, you can use claude in VS code, correct?
00:37:32:12 - 00:37:34:04
Stefan
Yeah. They added an extension.
00:37:34:06 - 00:37:36:22
Jens
Which is good for anthropic, right.
00:37:36:25 - 00:37:41:21
Stefan
Good for anthropic, yes. And good for Microsoft as well.
00:37:41:23 - 00:38:11:06
Jens
I mean, I think, I think, I think GitHub makes, makes a smart move here or Microsoft in general
with copilot because they, they don't have their own models. They just leverage their
distribution. And they, they bring all the good models they have contracts with, with the good
providers like Gemini, open AI and claude. I don't know, it's it's pretty smart.
00:38:11:08 - 00:38:31:18
Jens
I mean, GitHub has another problem because there's now there's this discussion going on
between the CEO of GitHub who posts on Twitter that, developers are not going away. And I
think that's a, that's a pretty controversial thing because, you know, like.
00:38:31:20 - 00:38:33:12
Stefan
CEO of.
00:38:33:15 - 00:39:06:00
Jens
GitHub says that developers like AI will not kill developers. Obviously it is what this person has
to say. Otherwise he would harm GitHub because GitHub is a tool for for devs. I'm I'm super
curious what what direction GitHub is, is going on on the long term, like my, my personal opinion
and I, I don't know, I, I have a, I have a limited, limited knowledge in the field.
00:39:06:00 - 00:39:08:17
Jens
But my, my current observation is that.
00:39:08:19 - 00:39:09:15
Stefan
00:39:09:18 - 00:39:37:22
Jens
LLMs help good developers to get more stuff done. So my current take is, developers are not
going anywhere. Like I see it in our company and I have some observations with tools like
cursor. Yeah, exactly. Jacob. Thank you. GitHub CEO says the smartest companies will hire
more software engineers, not less, as AI develops. So that's what he's saying.
00:39:37:24 - 00:39:39:10
Jens
My observation.
00:39:39:12 - 00:39:41:02
Stefan
Currently is.
00:39:41:04 - 00:40:03:21
Jens
That LLMs are cool and they help you write code. A lot of code. But you still need very good
developers. You you still need, senior devs. You still need people who guide the LLM to do the
right thing. Like, it's so easy to to generate a garbage code with an LLM that looks right, but it's
wrong.
00:40:03:23 - 00:40:22:23
Jens
And one other topic I wanted to to bring up you know, you keep seeing this post that like, just
like two days ago, I saw that, someone posted somewhere that, Google is now or at Google,
there is now more than 50% of the code is written by LLM.
00:40:22:24 - 00:40:25:07
Stefan
That was Salesforce. That was Salesforce.
00:40:25:09 - 00:40:35:12
Jens
Okay. So yeah, I was okay. Well, what's your take on on this post? Because I, I think I will have
a different one. I have, yeah.
00:40:35:14 - 00:40:55:05
Stefan
Okay. So my take is Salesforce is pushing there like AI, CRM called Agent Force. And I think if
you say it again, so 50% of all the code at Salesforce is being written by AI. I think it just means
that they're 50% faster because the developers are using AI, not the AI is writing the code and
it's adding to it.
00:40:55:05 - 00:41:06:21
Stefan
But I think he's trying to say is that developers are more productive, but he's spinning it that I've
replaced 50% of my workforce with AI. That's my take on it. Are you on the same one or not?
00:41:06:24 - 00:41:44:29
Jens
Okay. My take is that that it's complete nonsense. Like I'm not dismissing what you said, but. So
here's my take. Let's say your company writes 100 lines of code per day in total. And if we now
say that we, we write, 50% of the code with AI, with LLMs, you would assume that tomorrow
when this is right that we would now write 50 lines of code with AI and 50 lines of code with
humans.
00:41:45:01 - 00:41:47:09
Jens
That's what you would assume, right?
00:41:47:12 - 00:41:48:13
Stefan
Yeah.
00:41:48:16 - 00:42:24:15
Jens
But my observation is completely different. My observation is that LLMs have a tendency to just
write a lot of code. They don't reuse code in smart ways. They don't understand the entirety of
your code base. So my assumption is that yesterday the humans wrote 100 lines of code. Then
they discovered that they can now use AI, and suddenly they are writing like 200 lines of code in
a day.
00:42:24:18 - 00:42:53:02
Jens
The problem is, it doesn't mean that these new 100 lines of code are equally good or even
better. It's just we are now writing more code, and I'm telling you, experienced developers know
this. Every line of code is a liability. Like, ideally, you could be a billionaire with zero lines of code
because if you have code, you have to test it, you have to maintain the technical debt, blah blah,
blah, blah, blah.
00:42:53:07 - 00:43:21:20
Jens
So actually, I think and then I'm very curious to see this, but I would like to know like from
companies if you're using, if everybody's now using cursor, it's the amount of code that you
write. Is it, is it growing faster. So does it mean you're now writing more code, more verbose
code or something? Because that means you're essentially the liability grows faster.
00:43:21:20 - 00:43:50:10
Jens
So this take of 50% of the code, we're now writing it with LLMs. I'm I'm curious in a sense that's
like, first of all, how do you measure that? And and second, I'm not sure if it's a totally positive
trend, to be honest. And I can also speak from my personal experience. We have different code
bases. Recently I wrote some code in our in our GraphQL engine, our GraphQL engine.
00:43:50:10 - 00:44:16:13
Jens
It's so complicated that I don't I don't use cursor to write code in it because it doesn't make
sense. It doesn't it doesn't get what we're doing there. So I'm just writing it by hand. And then we
have a CLI and I added a new command and the code, the existing code didn't really I don't
know, it it didn't feel like this is the most amazing code.
00:44:16:15 - 00:44:43:20
Jens
So I was like, okay, whatever, I just use cursor for that and it generates and generates and blah,
blah, blah. And, yeah, it's it's quite verbose, but my, my, my real question is like is the code that
is written by AI like, is it really like more valuable or, you know, better questions I would ask is if
you use a LLMs to write code, is it more reliable?
00:44:43:23 - 00:45:01:06
Jens
Is the code faster? Are we are we shipping faster? Are we saving time? And you also have to
offset this against the the cost for the for the LLM. So I think it's more than just saying we're now
writing 50% of our code with AI.
00:45:01:08 - 00:45:17:17
Stefan
I think you're spot on with that. Also, recently we were working with a very big company and,
they submitted a PR. And what did you say today? You're like, what the hell? This is just cursor
garbage or something. And we had to go back and review it. And I think we're starting to see a
lot of that.
00:45:17:17 - 00:45:40:25
Stefan
Like we work with some pretty big companies and they're starting to use cursor. But if you
remember, I think a year and a half ago Klarna that big like pay later company. They said we've
replaced 80% of our customer support and customer success with AI. It's all going to be AI year
later. We messed up. We're sorry, and they've hired back all the customer success people.
00:45:40:25 - 00:45:57:18
Stefan
I think we haven't seen the repercussions yet at a large scale of writing garbage code. I really
don't think so. And I'll give you a thing like for example, yesterday I was messing with cursor and
I'm like building like some small like, if you remember Skyrim, they have this like constellation
where you can like uplevel. And I was just building that for myself.
00:45:57:18 - 00:46:17:28
Stefan
Maybe I can like, track my progress and are there and it's great at that. It's great at building very
simple, fun stuff, but I cannot see it building complex where code bases, where you ever see the
notes where it's like, please don't remove this. I don't know why, but this function makes sure
that our company runs. Please don't remove it.
00:46:18:03 - 00:46:28:19
Stefan
It's like, if we cannot understand it, how do you expect cursor to be like, oh, this function does
this like the guys literally like, if we remove this, the entire website will break. We don't know
why. Please don't remove.
00:46:28:19 - 00:46:32:06
Stefan
This. Like what? Yeah, I don't know. Oh.
00:46:32:06 - 00:46:57:21
Jens
Also in a in a similar direction, one thing I observed in the GraphQL subreddit, and you might
see it in other subreddits as well, I haven't checked, but there was recently there was a guy who
posted in like 24 hours. He posted two new repositories that solved different problems, and you
always see the same pattern. It's like you see from the description.
00:46:57:23 - 00:47:02:14
Jens
It has like emojis and it's like.
00:47:02:16 - 00:47:04:09
Stefan
Yeah, you know, immediately.
00:47:04:09 - 00:47:30:13
Jens
Okay, this is AI generated. And I, we see this new trend and I really hate it honestly, that people
are like, oh, there's a little problem. I created a library with it. I cursor together and then they,
they publish it. So I think we currently see a lot of like low quality things. And then under one of
such repositories there was a comment like, hey, are you are you implementing like the full
GraphQL spec?
00:47:30:13 - 00:47:39:16
Jens
And then the response was kind of like, I don't know. It's working for these cases here. I have
tests and.
00:47:39:18 - 00:47:40:19
Stefan
Yeah, you.
00:47:40:19 - 00:47:48:14
Jens
cursor.
Can you can clearly see that there's there's not just positive effects of of having tools like like
00:47:48:17 - 00:48:06:19
Stefan
Yeah. And I think we'll definitely start to see more and more. It's an interesting environment that
we're in right now. I'm always wondering like I'm seeing it also in film, like people are starting to
add AI into film and like if, if you can add AI to help edit faster. So that way you can make
movies faster, that's great.
00:48:06:21 - 00:48:20:20
Stefan
But if you start adding AI actors and you start killing that essence of film, like film is an art,
programing is an art. Like you should use tools that speed it up. But if you kill the very essence
of that art, like what you have kind of sucks.
00:48:20:22 - 00:48:48:07
Jens
Which which leads a little bit into the direction that we're going with WunderGraph as a, as a
company, because look what we kind of figured out is that cursor and AI coding tools. They are
great. They are great at solving some problems, but we believe like the real problem and we get
a lot of positive feedback from the market where we are showing our new product.
00:48:48:09 - 00:49:11:29
Jens
We get a lot of, of, of feedback that, the, the real problem is collaboration. Like, I think what is
going to happen with AI is that we will see like more and more parts of software or more or
more. Yeah, more and more parts of of software development. We will we will automate them,
we will make them faster and so on, so forth.
00:49:12:01 - 00:49:14:27
Jens
But, the, the real.
00:49:14:29 - 00:49:15:24
Stefan
I.
00:49:15:25 - 00:49:39:18
Jens
Think the like the real bottleneck is, is better collaboration. So for example, if you if you take the
whole journey of creating, creating software, and going from like I have a product owner, they
have new requirements, they go to the designer, they now have a design from this design, you
have to figure out, like, what kind of APIs do I need to to solve that problem.
00:49:39:18 - 00:50:04:15
Jens
Then you have the the API definition. You need to figure out like what services should
implement that. Then, you kind of block the frontend team because there is no service running
yet. So you need to think about how can I provide mocks that can take, a lot of time on the, on
the backend guys. So this whole journey, we kind of figured out that, it's, it's very hard to
actually go through that.
00:50:04:15 - 00:50:32:00
Jens
And if you give people cursor, it means if I have the perfect spec for my frontend, and if I have
the perfect spec for my backend, okay, I can now build it a little bit faster, like it's it's not taking
like, three days anymore. It's just taking like one day or half a day. But the real the real problem
was coming to the spec, coming to okay, here's our design.
00:50:32:00 - 00:50:52:20
Jens
What API do we need? And then you have this API definition. What kind of server, which
services should own that that logic. How does how do we distribute that. Yes. And then task
management. Like how do I ensure that, I'm implementing all the, the right parts. Meanwhile
how can I unblock unblock frontend guys to to work on that.
00:50:52:23 - 00:51:16:19
Jens
So all these kind of problems and that's something we, we figured as a, as a company we, we
want to solve that. So we're currently building building a solution to help with this whole, journey.
And, yeah, I think that's that's pretty interesting. Stefan, what what are you what are your
thoughts on on what?
00:51:16:19 - 00:51:23:28
Jens
We're what we're currently building and and, what what kind of feedback did you get from the
from the market so far?
00:51:24:00 - 00:51:41:22
Stefan
Good question. But first, I remember one time I was talking to a very like he IPOd a company
very successful founder, and he started a new company. I was like, why are you starting a new
company like you IPO? You can do whatever you want in the world. And he's like, I wanted to
build this product because I think the world needs it.
00:51:41:26 - 00:52:02:10
Stefan
Not that I think it needs it, but the world must have it. It must have this product because I have
to. And it's like, he's like, I felt I was put on this earth to solve that problem. And as long as Ive
known Jens. But I fundamentally think that the product that we're building, it's not a we're doing
this to get rich, but it's a thing that we're building this product because the world needs this
product.
00:52:02:10 - 00:52:24:16
Stefan
It needs the end to end business platform product to build digital products or however we end
up wording it. And what I've seen in the calls is you might be having a rough day. You go into
this call, you show this new product, and when you're showing a new product, like your anxiety
is pretty high because you've taken something from your head, you've put it out there into the
world and you don't know if they'll understand it.
00:52:24:16 - 00:52:40:10
Stefan
You don't know if they'll get it. Sometime people are like, wait, what? But then somebody is like,
oh my God, you don't know how many times I've done this. You don't know how many tools I've
used to do this. And you're like, oh, okay. Like so they also have experience of pain, what I do,
and then somebody else is like, this is amazing.
00:52:40:13 - 00:52:57:01
Stefan
Do you have plans for this? And then you're like, yes. And then they're like, okay, how much?
And what you've quickly realized is like, Holy crap, somebody actually wants this. And it's, you
know, I think that's what's the joy of entrepreneurship is like that little thing is like a little rocket
booster. It's like a little like, you know, like shot of adrenaline.
00:52:57:01 - 00:53:19:01
Stefan
And then you go into another company and they're like, oh my God. I also have the same
problems as that other company. But they don't they don't know each other. They've never
spoken to each other, but they have the exact same problem and they start doing the exact
same thing. So what I've seen is right now with this product that we're building, it's it really is
beautiful, you know, just coming out of a creation and then having that, people use it and we're
going to be releasing it soon internally to our customers.
00:53:19:01 - 00:53:30:09
Stefan
time.
It's it's gonna be fantastic. Let's jump though, if you're okay with it. Because I do want to talk
about the last ten minutes, which is kind of relates to this new product, which is we're almost at
00:53:30:09 - 00:53:31:09
Jens
Right?
00:53:31:11 - 00:53:36:01
Stefan
hinting at it.
Do we have time to talk about it, or should we just keep talking about our new product and
00:53:36:03 - 00:53:37:11
Stefan
Where we can.
00:53:37:11 - 00:53:40:23
Jens
Talk next week about the other thing?
00:53:40:25 - 00:54:03:14
Stefan
But Jens, if you can, without giving too much, like what was the biggest issue that you saw with
these companies like and also like how did you see it like when everyone knows our history, we
were about to die. We pivoted into Federation, we exploded. Everything's going great. But that
was never the end goal. The goal was never to stay there.
00:54:03:14 - 00:54:09:15
Stefan
Like, how did you see it?
00:54:09:18 - 00:54:13:06
Jens
So it was like two years ago and we were.
00:54:13:06 - 00:54:16:01
Stefan
Building we we.
00:54:16:01 - 00:54:32:19
Jens
We, we built the Wonder Graph SDK, which is a back end for front end framework. That was
kind of like my invention, I wouldn't really say invented. By the way, you keep pumping against
your microphone. You need you really need to stop doing that.
00:54:32:21 - 00:54:33:19
Stefan
But okay.
00:54:33:19 - 00:54:35:15
Stefan
It's my mic when I go here.
00:54:35:18 - 00:54:58:13
Jens
Yeah, it's it's that. Okay. So we were building on the graph SDK, the backend for front end thing.
And was my invention. I really liked it. Everybody liked it. Nobody wanted to pay for it. Long
story short. This this was a great product. And, it didn't help us to build a great company. Okay.
So.
00:54:58:15 - 00:54:59:25
Stefan
Yeah, we.
00:54:59:28 - 00:55:18:00
Jens
We were running out of money. We still had, like, I don't know, like half a year or something. Left
four five, so. Okay. Like two, two and a half years ago we, we said okay, pivot. What what are
we pivoting. And it was it was very funny. It was like Stefan he had like, he had like a black
notebook.
00:55:18:01 - 00:55:21:01
Jens
No, like a real notebook. Do you have it still?
00:55:21:03 - 00:55:31:19
Stefan
So is it a pandemic? No, no, no, no, it's not The Notebook. But I buy the same notebook and I
write all my notes and thoughts in. Okay, I have here on my bookshelf just six of them. The one
that I had is there.
00:55:31:20 - 00:55:33:13
Jens
You have the old one still.
00:55:33:15 - 00:55:35:09
Stefan
Yeah. Good one. So. Okay.
00:55:35:14 - 00:55:39:09
Jens
Yeah. You we don't need it. It's it's fine, but okay.
00:55:39:11 - 00:55:40:28
Stefan
00:55:41:01 - 00:55:43:28
Stefan
But it's more fun if I bring it because, look.
00:55:44:00 - 00:55:44:17
Stefan
So.
00:55:44:20 - 00:55:46:26
Stefan
Much notebooks.
00:55:46:28 - 00:55:48:24
Jens
I thought it was black. Was it not.
00:55:48:24 - 00:55:49:18
Stefan
Black?
00:55:49:20 - 00:55:51:13
Stefan
No its red.
00:55:51:15 - 00:55:52:19
Jens
Okay. Right. But.
00:55:52:19 - 00:55:55:05
Stefan
So we had this notebook. We were. We were on.
00:55:55:05 - 00:56:21:03
Jens
The retreats in the Netherlands on, old sheep farmhouse, and we were like, okay, we're fucked.
This is over. We need to pivot. And then Stefan opened the like, you know, we were all sitting
around. We were all all sad, and the mood wasn't great. And Stefan was opening his notebook
and he was like, okay, let me see what what what kind of notes I have.
00:56:21:05 - 00:56:44:17
Jens
And he he figured out that a bunch of people ask us, about open source Apollo Federation
alternative, and, Yeah. So. Okay, well, what are you going to do? So we had some money left,
some runway left. We were too many people. So we we had to, to part ways, part ways with,
with a bunch of people.
00:56:44:17 - 00:57:07:07
Jens
Unfortunately. And then we built cosmo. That's like two years ago or something. And, shortly
after I was on, on, a summer vacation with the with the family. And what what typically happens
is when I'm. when I'm on a vacation, I move out of the day to day business, and, I can never
stop thinking about WunderGraph.
00:57:07:07 - 00:57:28:04
Jens
So I don't know if I'm. If I'm not dead I'm thinking about WunderGraph. Probably, sometimes
about the family, but, most, most of the time, I, I don't know, I the head just can't stop thinking,
okay. So. And two years ago, I was on summer vacation with the family, and I had to I had an
idea.
00:57:28:04 - 00:57:40:25
Jens
I called Stefan, and I said, Stefan, we will make Cosmo open source. it's a stupid idea, but we
have to, because if we don't do it, someone else will do it.
00:57:40:27 - 00:57:42:09
Stefan
So we just we.
00:57:42:09 - 00:58:09:19
Jens
Just make it open source. And I still remember how I said, we make this thing open source. We
get momentum. And once we have momentum, we we will figure out the next step. I cannot tell
you today what this next step will be, but if we get enough traction, if we get enough customers,
we will learn something. We will figure out something, and that will help us then build the the
next step.
00:58:09:19 - 00:58:32:29
Jens
And it's like, you know, like it's like building a rocket ship. You know, you have like one stage it
lifts you in the air. And then, you have to have a second stage that that lifts you somewhere
else. The only problem with a startup, you don't have stages. You just have your one stage. And
you you really have to hope that's burning your first stage.
00:58:33:06 - 00:58:41:26
Jens
You figure out something to create the second stage because otherwise. Yeah, true. You had a
startup.
00:58:41:29 - 00:58:56:03
Stefan
No. It's a it's beautiful. We are almost at time. So, guys, we'll talk a little bit more next week.
We're going to be back regularly. Jens might be going on vacation in August. Me too. So we
may have some delays there, but we'll figure it out. Jacob, let's really try to get Sam on the
podcast.
00:58:56:03 - 00:59:10:15
Stefan
I'll connect you with a couple people. We should bring a really cool guest on here and talk
hardcore tech Jens. I'm happy we're back. I missed the podcast. I missed this conversations. I
missed the story. We do have a meeting we need to run to. But guys, thank you so much for
joining us today. Yes they were they were cursor.
00:59:10:15 - 00:59:22:13
Stefan
I barely knew her. And of course David with the banter. Guys, thank you so much. Have a great
weekend and we will see you next. Oh wait. Just kidding. Wait. Yeah, actually, no. What's the
good thing?
00:59:22:16 - 00:59:25:15
Jens
What's the good thing? Oh, we're we're back next week.
00:59:25:17 - 00:59:26:15
Stefan
You see, it's been.
00:59:26:17 - 00:59:28:21
Stefan
A while, man.
00:59:28:24 - 00:59:29:22
Stefan
I'm out of touch.
00:59:29:24 - 00:59:35:23
Stefan
Bye, guys. So so funny. I was like, maybe that's what's.
