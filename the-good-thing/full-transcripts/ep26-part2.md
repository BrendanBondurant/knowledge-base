I think it depends how your company is being valued. Right. You know, you and if you if you
believe that certain amounts of burning leads to growth. Right. So this is there's, there's this
growth and there's very durable growth. Right. There's you can buy growth. I mean, you just
look at the, we don't do anything silly like post user graphs.
00:32:00:08 - 00:32:29:01
Sam
If any database companies are measuring themselves by user graphs. Very silly because we
have companies that pay us millions of dollars of a year, and they have 3 or 4 user accounts on
the on the platform, they have 3 or 4 people that administrate the database. So user growth for
a database is indicative of literally nothing. But they're connected up to these vibe coding
platforms and they're giving away free computers at an extreme loss to themselves.
00:32:29:03 - 00:32:45:25
Sam
And seeing growth. Right. Well, I mean, is that growth, is that? Is that durable growth? No
obvious is a happy that we've built a successful business and actual business. It's not a
business until it makes money, right. Like when when you when you see more money going into
the bank than leaves. That is a business.
00:32:45:25 - 00:33:27:00
Sam
You have solved. You've conquered really, really tough, problems and built a positive gross
margin business. Even the bottom end tiers of our product are profitable to us. Like you, nobody
costs us money to run on our platform, meaning that every company, every customer that
comes in it, like, contributes to the health of the business. Whereas if you're VC funded, and
burning, you can be VC funded and profitable, VC funded and burning capital really
aggressively to grow or to to get some sort of paper growth that you have to turn into, like real
growth one day, if you're doing that, then it's very hard to know how you'll invert that, right?
00:33:27:00 - 00:33:48:10
Sam
Like and all of these, these numbers that you see of extreme user growth get very muddied
when they're giving stuff away for free on the internet. Right? Like it's once you're giving stuff too
much away for free on the internet, all of your growth numbers are just they don't mean
anything, right? Like it is like, you know, you are not beating Domino's because you're giving
away free pizza outside Domino's.
00:33:48:10 - 00:33:52:08
Sam
You are giving away free pizza outside dominoes. That's that's it. You have not built a healthier
business.
00:33:52:09 - 00:34:21:20
Jens
Domino's at the same time, like, how VCs typically work like they have a they have a fund. This
fund has a lifetime. And at some at some event in that lifetime, they they want the money back.
They want an exit or, or something. And, like being, being profitable in that case it's, it's not
enough. Right. They, they, they will want to see something.
00:34:21:20 - 00:34:30:24
Jens
How do you how do you think about the future of, of planet scale given that it's it's it's not the
youngest, company anymore.
00:34:30:27 - 00:34:48:24
Sam
It's fairly young for a database company, I'll tell you that. Like, if you look at if you look at the if
you look at the true arc of infrastructure, you know, Figma IPOing reminded me of this, actually,
and like I saw, I remember how far along before they even had a product out in the world was
like, what, five years?
00:34:48:29 - 00:35:13:24
Sam
Because they were solving hard technical products. Problem product problems before they went
and built something. Database is the same. Mongo dragged along for a long time. Snowflake
dragged along for a long time. You just it takes a while to build trust. If you're going to build
something, that is enduring. And yeah, like every company wants an exit, it's much easier to get
to that exit when you have a business with good numbers.
00:35:13:24 - 00:35:35:15
Sam
That is additive to any company that went and, and did those things. And obviously it aligns for
everybody, for everybody. But companies are built more slowly than people realize. I think when
we sold github to Microsoft, it was its 13th year. Figma is like ten years and it just takes a long
time and longer than people imagine to go and do these things.
00:35:35:15 - 00:36:05:07
Sam
And the incentives are still aligned. The the chance of you doing those, like, look at the AI thing.
Right? If we'd have just tried to flame out like everyone else and had died before, AI. You can't
catch like if you're dead, right? You just you can't, you can't. You can't adapt when you're not
around. And so when it comes to infrastructure, it's about enduring and building up, something
foundational that people can work with.
00:36:05:09 - 00:36:26:02
Sam
It's also very good for beating out the companies that aren't profitable because you you can be
much more strategic. You just wait like if im in a Postgres market map, I just scrub a third of it off
because they won't be here in two years. They just won't. Right? Like we're already seeing it.
We're seeing it. We've already seen database vendors, just shutting down or running to other
exits or whatever.
00:36:26:02 - 00:36:35:16
Sam
We're not going to do that. We're going to build something that's enduring. And and that's how
we will return the most money to our investors and our employees.
00:36:35:19 - 00:36:49:28
Stefan
Well said. With that in mind, so I remember the blog post, you guys are a series B funded now,
right? C are you guys planning on doing D eventually or is it just continuing the growth the way
you guys are doing?
00:36:50:01 - 00:37:07:18
Sam
We might maybe, but it depends what the options are, right? If we if you don't have to raise
money. I think it depends the problems you have to solve. Right. Like we're still we have a
bunch of technical things that we need to get done, and we have. And we hire engineers, to do
those. And we are hiring.
00:37:07:18 - 00:37:31:06
Sam
We're like hired I think if I like ten people in the last, month or so, so that headcount is going to
sneak up a little bit, but it's great to embrace investment when you're problems now, are like go
to market problems, right. Like you need to reach you want to invest ahead of pipeline and
ahead of of of revenue to go and pull people in.
00:37:31:08 - 00:37:55:00
Sam
We have technical problems to solve right now, and we want to get our Postgres product out of
private preview and then move on to the sharded product. So we may if I try not to be dogmatic
about these things, I try to just do what I believe is the right thing. And if an investment is what's
going to grow the business more quickly and lead to better outcomes for our customers, we'll
take investment.
00:37:55:03 - 00:38:32:03
Sam
If we don't need to do that. Obviously that's a strong thing to do as well. There's so many
companies that just invest massively over their skis because they have to, and it produces a
worse outcome. Like this venture math is you have to get really big, right? For it to work. And if
you don't and you've just raised yourself, you've just diluted yourself out even there's this
founders that could have sold their company for 200 mil and made more money than when they
sold for there's a bunch of billion dollar exits where the founders make much, much less than
they would have made selling even at the first acquisition offer that they got.
00:38:32:09 - 00:38:35:15
Sam
It just depends what you're trying to build and what you're trying to do.
00:38:35:17 - 00:39:09:24
Jens
You know, when you see companies, with young founders raising like 200 million like this,
there's two things I'm thinking about. One is they don't have experience in spending that money
efficiently. And so what are you going to do with the money? And second, there there will be
expectations like that. The exit needs to be absolutely mental. And and at that point the the big
question is will you ever get there?
00:39:09:24 - 00:39:45:08
Jens
What's going to happen on on the way there? And then in the end to to be honest, if you do that,
I think your only chances somehow sell secondary somehow save something like and put the
put the money off the table. And other than that, you know, it's, it's a bit like when you, when you
watch these, these, these videos from, like, from the, from the rockets from, from Elon and those
like, if a rocket goes too fast at some point, it just disintegrates.
00:39:45:10 - 00:40:07:16
Jens
And like, the question is, how much money can you pour into a startup before it just blows up?
Because I don't know, like how do you actually manage 200 million like, I, I don't know, like for,
for us we're, we're, we're quite small still like every hire counts. And you, you think about how
you do things and you think strategically.
00:40:07:18 - 00:40:18:08
Jens
And if you, if you had 200 million, I don't know, we we would have so many people like, I, I'm not
sure if, if that makes sense.
00:40:18:10 - 00:40:39:10
Sam
Yeah. It really depends what you're doing. Right. Like, you just really there's some people that
can take that amount of capital and are in certain types of business where they can allocate that
capital incredibly quickly and put it to work and make it work. Elon being a good example of this.
But yeah, there's some companies that absolutely just explode because the, the there's less
consequences.
00:40:39:10 - 00:41:07:06
Sam
Like when you're when we want to be profitable, we want to be lean. You think about those
things, right? Like you think about how you're going to spend this money and get an ROI from
this money, versus these companies that you see just, like, explode. And then they're all over
with spending 50 grand on marketing videos and stuff like that, and they never really track
whether it comes back and makes anything, and it's fun and it's just like it creates that romance
story that Silicon Valley has and people like it.
00:41:07:06 - 00:41:25:13
Sam
And there's also just too much capital around. This is, you know, there's some of them. It's all on
Twitter about like VC market fit, which is kind of apt. Right. There's you know. Yeah. People I
don't think people I don't think, you know, you see people tout these big rounds in these raisers
and they think, oh, we're too big, we can't possibly fail.
00:41:25:15 - 00:41:46:21
Sam
And there's just a graveyard of companies that were the hottest thing. And then and then went
to nothing. All of these are kind of things we should think about. Meditation for all of us running
companies and to take those things very seriously. All I do know is that if you're going to sell
databases to large companies, you have to be able to communicate to them that you've got a
healthy future.
00:41:46:21 - 00:41:55:05
Sam
And we're luckily able to do that. And good luck to our competitors. So called competitors that
have to figure that out for themselves.
00:41:55:07 - 00:42:10:10
Stefan
Speaking of competitors, interesting question because we're talking about VC market fit. What
do you think of the acquisition of Neon by, Databricks. So they raised over 100 million in
funding. They had a way bigger team size than you. What do you think of that acquisition by
Databricks? I think right.
00:42:10:13 - 00:42:33:09
Sam
Yeah. Great. It's great for the neon team. Was a good outcome. Just agree. Just selling your
products and to to anyone that's paying is amazing milestone. Getting to $1 million of revenue is
an incredible milestone. Getting to 20 million is an incredible milestone. Any company that goes
through these milestones is amazing. But the main one, the big one, is some exit.
00:42:33:09 - 00:42:51:23
Sam
I hate the word exit, but I just keep the camera. I hate the word exit, by the way. Like it just
always triggers me. But yes, an exit or a form of liquid liquidity for your employees is an amazing
thing. So it's great. I'm like, congratulations to the neon team for doing that. It's it's a very hard
thing to do.
00:42:51:23 - 00:43:01:09
Sam
And they achieved it. So I'm I'm happy for them. It puts you know, set some value of like how
valuable growing Postgres companies are. So it's nice.
00:43:01:11 - 00:43:06:20
Jens
Well said speaking of employees, you're you said you're 55 people, right.
00:43:06:22 - 00:43:08:14
Sam
Yeah. Around that.
00:43:08:16 - 00:43:45:25
Jens
Okay. It's not easy to build to to build a company of 55 people that moves in one direction. What
what what is something where you would say, this is something you you as CEO, you
established in your company that that really made the difference. Like, what's it like working at
a, at planet scale and and how do you actually do it that the people, people like it and then they
can perform and all of that.
00:43:45:27 - 00:43:56:04
Sam
Yeah. That's a there's so many layers to that question. I think there's.
00:43:56:06 - 00:44:13:25
Sam
You have to really think about why people want to work at a tech company. Like, can they go
and do the craft and the things that they adhere to do well with this little kind of administrative
burden as possible? And we focus really hard on that. We stay very low in terms of meetings,
low on management overhead.
00:44:13:25 - 00:44:40:04
Sam
You don't have like tons of managers running around. We think very carefully about what it
means to be kind of a functional and performing employee at the company, and we treat our
employees with a ton of respect and, and we have them influence the things that they're here to
influence, and we trust them. It's a very trust based culture.
00:44:40:06 - 00:45:00:07
Sam
We, you know, get subject matter experts for every area of, of of, of what we're here to do and
give them immense freedom to go and do those things we just don't like, kind of micromanage
them. I have run big teams, like the largest team I ran, I think it was about 400 people. And
yeah, I mean, you can do all these things.
00:45:00:07 - 00:45:22:01
Sam
You need to do the performance reviews, the people management and all that stuff. But if you
have a small team of very good people, and fit the culture around that, you can. You can build a
company that people like working out. Like if you work with other smart people that you find
challenging, and then you learn and you grow, it becomes very addictive to go and do that and
have influence.
00:45:22:01 - 00:45:52:08
Sam
And that's the kind of feedback we get from from folks. We do miss the mark sometimes. You
don't hire people, great people every time. And that's why we have one of our values is no
passengers, meaning we don't really tolerate people not kind of being here and working hard
and being present and doing good work. And you have to kind of clean up those types of issues
and let people go and if you're fair about how you do that, then it kind of works.
00:45:52:10 - 00:46:12:15
Sam
Another one is experts, leading experts, which is we believe that everyone should be an expert
in the field, that there are and should be. You want to work for a boss that you aren't, you know
that you respect as an expert. So we have we don't have non-technical managers and things
like that's just silly things like that.
00:46:12:18 - 00:46:15:12
Jens
Are you still writing code?
00:46:15:14 - 00:46:41:22
Sam
I do, but not really anything that goes into the critical path in production, because if I would not
be able to make myself available to, like, be on call to kind of remediate those things. Plus, I'm
probably the worst engineer at the company now. So that's not, it's not a anything anyone's
caught. No one's missing me writing code, but I've done a few, you know, small features or
integrations or add ons for our ecosystem and things like that.
00:46:41:23 - 00:46:45:07
Sam
I'll fuck around with.
00:46:45:09 - 00:46:55:24
Jens
Yeah. Like people are also sometimes annoyed when when I write some code or they joke
about it and, yeah, it's similar. It's fun.
00:46:55:24 - 00:47:16:09
Sam
Like we've had some like niche MySQL issues that, you know, I've been able to, like solve or
just remembered some similar things in the past. And it's always kind of funny when it's me that
remembers that or whatever. But yeah, not a whole load.
00:47:16:12 - 00:47:28:01
Jens
The thing I love the most is, when I get impatient, I vibe code something and then I go to the
guys and then they are super annoyed because they have to get to production ready.
00:47:28:04 - 00:47:47:08
Sam
What's the best way to do it? Right? It's like have come up with something that people sort of
dislike, and then they'll go and tidy up and fix it. One thing I do, do is I have access. The
customers, our customers give me access to their planet scale orgs, and I'll often work with
them as a user and so help them out a bit.
00:47:47:11 - 00:48:02:22
Sam
I like joke. It's like the the most premium tier of support that we have, which is like, I'll go and
mess around with their stuff. And it's a really nice way of seeing from their side how interacting
with the product is and seeing the any pain that we put them through.
00:48:02:24 - 00:48:03:29
Jens
Yeah.
00:48:04:01 - 00:48:05:26
Stefan
That's awesome.
That's that's a good one. Another question I have is, so, vitess open source. It's, Cncf project,
00:48:05:29 - 00:48:16:10
Jens
right?
00:48:16:13 - 00:48:17:23
Sam
Yes.
00:48:17:25 - 00:48:34:27
Jens
And like a while ago there was like in the situation between Cncf and, the guys behind NATs and
a, what's the company called? Something with s.
00:48:34:29 - 00:48:43:18
Sam
Oh, I vaguely recall this. Yeah, I know I didn't pay much attention. Yeah, there was some drama,
I think. No, I can't remember.
00:48:43:18 - 00:49:08:06
Jens
Yeah. So they, they, they, they somehow they wanted to pull out the, the, the project out of the
Cncf and get more control over it. I don't even want to talk about that, but what I'm interested in
this. What's your relationship with, with the Cncf and, Well, is it good that vitess is a Cncf project
or is it neutral or.
00:49:08:07 - 00:49:10:15
Jens
I don't know, is it anything.
00:49:10:17 - 00:49:30:03
Sam
I think it's a good thing. I believe in open source. I believe if you're going to be open source, you
should be you should be really open source. You know, like there's types of licensing that I don't
like. When they pretend they're open source, when they're not or whatever. But there's also
licensing that I think is great and defends companies against companies like Amazon.
00:49:30:03 - 00:49:49:23
Sam
And yeah, like there would be a downside if Amazon just stole our tech and went and started
using it. Right. And that was not a good thing. But that's kind of what you throw into when you
do open source. And I think it's good to have these foundations in these bodies that protect
open source and allow some purity to these projects.
00:49:49:25 - 00:50:06:23
Sam
There is downsides generally from the model, but they're not specific to Cncf at all. And they're
a great crew. Chris and the team over there are just fantastic. And they do something that's very
difficult to do and wrangle a lot of the complexities that come with open source. And so, yeah, I
don't see it really as a downside.
00:50:06:23 - 00:50:12:23
Sam
I think it's the goods that keeps us honest. As an open source company.
00:50:12:26 - 00:50:28:09
Stefan
And what are some open source licenses that you don't like? So like for us, just for context,
we're licensed under Apache 2.0. Some of our competitors do BSL. I think BSL was created
because of Mongo right Amazon went and took it. Yeah okay. So what are some licenses that
you like or and don't like.
00:50:28:12 - 00:50:48:13
Sam
There's lot like I guess I should have I but I don't dislike the license I dislike the pretense. Right.
So yeah BSL for example. Right. It's not an open source license. It is officially not recognized as
an open source license. But there's companies that will do BSL and refer to themselves as open
source. And I don't like that.
00:50:48:15 - 00:51:13:17
Sam
Like your code is open. That's fine. But you can't I mean, you've blocked any contributors to that
going and starting a rival company to you that's not open source. That is not how that works.
And so I don't like the kind of layering on top of, you know, I think if there's a lot of people that
have one way relationships with open source and it's very take, take, take, and I don't like that.
00:51:13:19 - 00:51:36:29
Sam
If you're going to use the glow and the incredible branding of what is the most in one of the most
amazing human achievements, which is the open source, like you think the open source
community is just a phenomenal human achievement to be able to, like, bask in the glory of that
and use open source in terms of your branding and furthering your company.
00:51:37:01 - 00:52:01:08
Sam
But holding back the actual license from being an open source license, I think is very wrong. So
yeah, I don't really have a Beef for the specific, like there's some licenses that are just more.
The GPL is annoyingly like niche and well, has like niche ramifications that GitHub would always
just suggest people use their MIT license because it's the most simple and most open.
00:52:01:10 - 00:52:10:23
Sam
But yeah, it's no no specific license problems. It's more like the approaches people take by
taking these non open source licenses and claiming to be open source. I think it's very cheeky.
00:52:10:25 - 00:52:19:28
Jens
Do you have like like a fork of like an internal fork of of vitess or is it just you use the open
source. We test. That's what you deploy.
00:52:20:01 - 00:52:40:22
Sam
We do have an internal fork and it's really for simplicity. Right. Like rather than there's no we're
not trying to do like a kind of premium thing where you, there's like a ton of features hidden.
There's some stuff that's platform specific to us, which we don't even want to bend the, vitess
project out of shape too much to be specific to planet scale.
00:52:40:22 - 00:53:01:15
Sam
So we run our forecast selves to kind of address some of those things. Same with our MySQL
fork. It's open, but you know, it's not like we push it out there for people to go and like run it
themselves. It just has the things we need to go and do our platform. But yeah, we run a fork.
We do, but not it's not the kind of like, oh, here's like a super pared down thing in terms of
vitess.
00:53:01:15 - 00:53:17:12
Sam
It's, it's it's more like fit and functionality to work well with our platform. And that's things we just
we wouldn't put into the test anyway. The everything we can upstream into vitess. We absolutely
do. And a lot of things just start with the test code base and get pulled into our fork.
00:53:17:15 - 00:53:28:03
Jens
Is there a possibility that that someone could prevent you from from merging something into the
into the public? vitess repo.
00:53:28:06 - 00:53:32:09
Sam
If we didn't have control of the maintainer ship, then yeah. Yes.
00:53:32:12 - 00:53:33:18
Jens
You have you have control.
00:53:33:23 - 00:53:39:13
Sam
Yes. We are the maintainers. The project. Yes. Or like nearly all the maintainers work for us is.
00:53:39:19 - 00:53:54:05
Jens
way.
But by the way, by by the I read something about the C, Cncf and maybe I misunderstood it, but
is it not like you need to have, like other companies who also contributed and in a meaningful
00:53:54:08 - 00:54:15:13
Sam
And we do slack, HubSpot, Etsy, they, they all contribute, it's great that Uber have put a lot of
contributions into vitess lately. It's fantastic. We we absolutely do. We have we're very happy
with, that's what makes it great. Right. Like that was what makes it generalizable. You know, it
means we can we get to listen and deal with the concerns that they have.
00:54:15:13 - 00:54:46:18
Jens
It's fantastic when when someone from Uber wants to, wants to merge something upstream,
and you would have to spend a significant time to, to plan the feature, to review, to collaborate,
etc., etc. is that is that's all something like I would get from you for free or do I need to have a
contract with you? Or would you just spend time with me or or how are you handling these kind
of relationships?
00:54:46:20 - 00:55:04:22
Sam
Yeah, you don't need to have a contract. Basically. Yeah. Like we we recommend if you're going
to send a very large change to vitess that you consult us first on the approach. Like there's
some people that say, like people are generally fairly sensible. They'll like hit us up and say, you
know, we we're thinking vitess should do this.
00:55:04:24 - 00:55:22:10
Sam
And we'll tell them if we disagree, like if someone shows up and say, we think we should change
vitess to be a Postgres compatible or Mongo compatible, we would say we disagree and we
wouldn't accept patches that do that. Right. On the other hand, if someone says we want to take
this approach to do this thing, can you kind of guide us towards it?
00:55:22:10 - 00:55:41:14
Sam
We'll say, yeah, absolutely. It's valuable. Or sometimes people show up with a bunch of
functionality and we need to go back and forth a bit to kind of help them. Maybe they've missed
certain ways of doing things that are already there that, you know, can just be tidied up, or we
need to tidy up this implementation. And they haven't thought about a downstream effect that
would affect a load of other people.
00:55:41:16 - 00:55:57:29
Sam
They may not have thought about the elegant upgrade path or whatever. Right. Like we help
them think through those things, but that's part of the burden of running a really big open source
project that has so many large companies that depend on it. You just have to kind of do that to
keep the project healthy. Again, that's another hard dynamic for companies, right?
00:55:57:29 - 00:56:07:15
Sam
this magnitude.
They it's this in or out thing. You have to take it super seriously. When you maintain projects of
00:56:07:17 - 00:56:37:22
Jens
Yeah. You you have, a pretty decent score in terms of availability of your service. And, like one
thing, I think we we all agree software has bugs. Yeah. And when you change software, you
introduce bugs. You fix some, you add some more. How how how can you actually ensure that
whatever you're deploying, like, you're, you're not breaking your your customers.
00:56:37:22 - 00:56:47:09
Jens
Like what? What is happening like behind the scenes to to be able to continuously contribute to
a database project and not mess it up.
00:56:47:12 - 00:57:07:02
Sam
Yeah. So we're not perfect. We obviously do create bugs and our software has bugs and has
edge cases. I think it all begins with the acknowledgment that those things happen. Right? Like
if you if you're leveraging that, you're going to create bug like the idea that you're going to create
bug free software, you're going to make less availability, right?
00:57:07:05 - 00:57:31:26
Sam
There's a lot of stuff that comes down to our shared nothing architecture, meaning that we have
no single, no true single points of failure in the stack, meaning you can incrementally roll things
out in ways that, get well tested and you can roll things back very, very simply. We obviously
start with a progressive kind of rollout and monitoring of of with that via our tooling that make
that possible.
00:57:31:28 - 00:58:06:07
Sam
And you just have to be very careful. You have to embrace a system that constantly changes.
So we excuse me. No, node of planet scale stays online for more than 29 days. Every single
node expires after 29 days, meaning the whole environment is entirely ephemeral. And it makes
you much like all those little things that churning through connections, churning through state, all
of those things that companies don't do often causes more outages for folks.
00:58:06:10 - 00:58:21:21
Sam
The fact we do it constantly and the system is designed, and when you ship something to
production, you have to account for the fact those things are going to happen. That's the that's
the, the special sauce.
00:58:21:23 - 00:58:38:23
Jens
. So with the with the 29 day expiry on all on all nodes, you, you kind of have Chaos monkey
embedded in the system because it probably means that every day some nodes come, some
go. And it's, it's a continuous every hour spiking of nodes.
00:58:39:00 - 00:59:01:02
Sam
Yeah. We run at such scale that you just we have constant node failures just constantly disks
explode like just constantly. And so it's great. I mean, the way you actually heal the
infrastructure is you kill nodes. We we have a prs and the ers is a planned repair parent shard
and a is is emergency. Those are like the ways you fix most problems.
00:59:01:02 - 00:59:21:16
Sam
If a node's misbehaving rather than like coddling it and trying to figure out just kill it, get rid of it,
look through the logs, isolate and find out what actually truly happened. But the immediate fix is
to kill it and have the cluster resolve back to a healthy state. When you've done that millions
upon millions of times, you get something that's very robust.
00:59:21:23 - 00:59:48:23
Sam
And it's the same with again, back to airplanes, right? They just have done millions and millions
of flight hours on very simple, principles. And the components of the system are very well tested
and stress tested. If you do that, you can you can gain continual leverage. And it's hard to
compete with. It's very hard to start like it's from first principles and build systems like that
without a lot of knowledge and expertise.
00:59:48:26 - 01:00:12:03
Jens
Yeah. But by the way, like when we're talking about, like, killing nodes and starting new nodes
and something well, what's what's the kind of scheduler behind the scenes like one of the most
well-known schedulers for running things is like, for example, Kubernetes. But do you, do you
have some like do you use like an existing product or have you built your own or how do you do
Kubernetes?
01:00:12:03 - 01:00:16:06
Sam
We by far run the most state in the world on Kubernetes.
01:00:16:08 - 01:00:18:08
Jens
Even with your metal machines.
01:00:18:08 - 01:00:19:19
Sam
Yes.
01:00:19:21 - 01:00:22:04
Jens
So on metal you run Kubernetes.
01:00:22:07 - 01:00:42:08
Sam
Its extremely light. They run as pods. Yeah, but an extremely light VM layer on top of the, on top
of the metal. So it's all scheduled and managed through that. So our, our Kubernetes operator is
very advanced. And that's another part of our kind of special sauce that you get when you use
our product.
01:00:42:10 - 01:00:45:11
Stefan
It's funny because I'm talking about you got to meet our CTO.
01:00:45:13 - 01:01:05:29
Sam
Yeah, it's really fun. It's really funny because, we did a survey and like 50% of the people
responding didn't believe you could run state on Kubernetes. And we're over here with
petabytes of state. And is this complete? It's very possible. It's hard. It's not easy to do. But you
get these all these benefits. So yeah, we use Kubernetes and, and our Kubernetes, right.
01:01:06:01 - 01:01:10:19
Sam
We're very cloud native, very, very much in the Cncf ecosystem. There.
01:01:10:22 - 01:01:17:00
Jens
And, what do you use as the, as the virtualization layer on, on behind the scenes?
01:01:17:03 - 01:01:23:11
Sam
What is it that Amazon use? It's the Amazon. What is it they point.
01:01:23:13 - 01:01:24:15
Jens
You mean firecracker.
01:01:24:16 - 01:01:27:07
Sam
Yeah, probably.
01:01:27:10 - 01:01:29:29
Jens
Yeah okay. That's
01:01:30:01 - 01:01:42:28
Sam
We run on we can run on EKS. We run on Google's version too. Yeah, it just fits in. Which was
specific to whichever cloud that we're running in. Basically.
01:01:43:00 - 01:02:06:26
Jens
Okay. If you if you didn't, if you wouldn't be in planet scale today. Would you start another
database company. Would you ever recommend anybody starting a database company? Is it
cool to run a database company, or would you do something else?
01:02:06:28 - 01:02:37:12
Sam
I don't do databases. Yeah, I don't know, I do something, I just like working at scale. You know, if
I didn't have a if I wasn't running a database startup, maybe I'd work at another product
company that has a lot of scale, and that would be fun. I don't know, though, like, there's
something about working at an infrastructure company that has all of these various customers
that I find incredibly fun and interesting, like just seeing what our customers do and doing
something that's so critical to them.
01:02:37:15 - 01:02:56:10
Sam
It's really fun. You live, like, vicariously through your customers. It's like a real kick to like, yeah, I
mean, we just signed up a customer that is a product, the product in the physical world that I
use all the time. And it just it's really fun to know that, like, the things you're doing. Empowered.
Yeah. Yeah. I've had by your product.
01:02:56:10 - 01:03:00:25
Sam
It gets really addictive sending a slack message or, you know, it just feels really fun.
01:03:00:28 - 01:03:12:09
Stefan
I tell that to my wife all the time. Like, we'll be walking by and I'll be like, oh, their website
powered by Wundergraph for, like, this retail store. Like, that stuff is powered by Wunder Graph.
And she's like, do you get discounts? I'm like, well, no, not like that.
01:03:12:09 - 01:03:23:08
Sam
But still yeah yeah yeah yeah. No, it's exactly that. You go, yeah. You drive past a billboard. It
just feels nice. And you became really loyal to your customers that you feel really grateful to
them. It's that it's lovely.
01:03:23:11 - 01:03:28:09
Stefan
I agree. And Jens, I have one question though, so I'll go ahead. We have one more. We have
time for one more. But go ahead.
01:03:28:11 - 01:03:42:28
Jens
Is it about the the scale by itself or the complexity of the problem, or is it really you, you like to
be, to be part of these companies, to be powering them or like what, what what's it's.
01:03:42:28 - 01:04:07:20
Sam
All of those like the complexity comes from scale. But like databases or any tech stuff that's not
at scale, just a real boring to me. Like what's like this is the issue with database world, right?
Like there's the academic end, which they have is obviously have significant contributions, but
you see these like hot new database is or whatever that do all these little like these fun whizzy
features and just can't scale at all.
01:04:07:20 - 01:04:32:29
Sam
It's like, okay, that's that's the boring. But you may join me. We all pretend we're an aircraft. We
sit in a box and go make noise, plane noises. It's like it's actually putting real stuff on the line.
People backing real products, is the bit that's hard. Like there's just. I watched a customer spin
up a cluster the other day that was a single database cluster with about 500 nodes in it.
01:04:33:01 - 01:05:02:25
Sam
Right? So it just they pressed one button and behind the scenes, all of our orchestration starts
in across three zones, hitting Amazon to start spinning up machines and just watching 500
servers orchestrate spin up, get a clean version of our infrastructure report for duty and
immediately act in unison to provide to like serve a database through one connection string.
01:05:02:27 - 01:05:21:13
Sam
It's just so fucking cool. Like it just was so nerdy. Like you just go, wow, like, you know what I
mean? It's just this orchestration of, yeah, I've always just love this all, seeing all these nodes
kind of, like, dance together, come together and do one thing. It's just amazing to me. And I just
beautiful. And I just love it so much.
01:05:21:15 - 01:05:41:20
Sam
It just feels so satisfying. Like, same with GitHub. You just get hooked too. You get, you know,
it's fun. Is living dangerously, deploying a website that I remember the first time, like when I
when I was onboarding at Facebook. Like deploying like pushing code that was about to get
deployed to Facebook for millions or billions of users. And you're just like, it just feels so cool.
01:05:41:20 - 01:05:55:21
Sam
It feels so meaningful. It's hard to go back and and and do anything differently. I'm glad other
people do. But for me, some for me, it's all theory until it works at extreme scale.
01:05:55:24 - 01:06:04:11
Jens
Do you have like a cool visualization layer or something that where you can where you can see,
like all the planet scale nodes across the globe or something?
01:06:04:14 - 01:06:36:10
Sam
No we don't. This is the thing we're very like. We're too utilitarian for that stuff. We don't do any
of the flashy bits. We just make it work. I mean, our UI is very beautiful. Jason and the team
have done a phenomenal job of making it look lovely, and it looks really nice, but it very simple.
It it kind of I don't know, it doesn't make you an even when you the you get tempted sometimes
like we could make some really cool visualizations show everyone all of these nodes all
orchestrating together, and then we just go back to doing other things.
01:06:36:17 - 01:06:46:12
Sam
You know, it's really hard to to fight the temptation to make all that fancy stuff. But no, you really
just see it in a terminal or a graph or something and, you know, it's cool.
01:06:46:15 - 01:07:04:22
Jens
Maybe if you want to do some cool marketing stunt, you know, there's from I think GitHub,
there's like, this animation they have like a globe and you can see all the, the commits,
whatever. Yeah. Maybe you could do like a globe where, where I could see all the planet scale
nodes coming up and down like green and red then.
01:07:04:23 - 01:07:05:08
Jens
Yeah.
01:07:05:11 - 01:07:32:24
Sam
I have so I actually started messing around with, like I sort of like dots that represent each one
of our nodes. And then as they flip, they change colors. And so I may do something similar to
that. It depends where the thing is from is people when you put stats like, like we announced
large customers migrating. And I don't want people to be able to correlate change with that with
those like people are very sensitive about data and the scale of what they do.
01:07:32:26 - 01:07:50:20
Sam
We just have to be very careful because, you know, what we put out there. But I do try and think
of ways we can represent that. And sometimes, you know, we've got one customer that's going
to talk publicly about the scale. They run out on plant scale. And I think some of those numbers,
well, will really impress people.
01:07:50:22 - 01:08:07:25
Stefan
And what I said and then we got a comment from somebody in the audience. But the last one
that I wanted to kind of end on. So we are a little bit over. But Sam, like, we can't end the
episode without talking about AI. And so how do you see AI interacting with databases? Has
MCP change how plants go conducts its day to day?
01:08:07:25 - 01:08:14:12
Stefan
databases?
Have you guys adopted tools like cursor windsurf or things like that? How do you just see AI in
01:08:14:14 - 01:08:41:11
Sam
It's lovely. I mean, there's the A's had an effect on databases in many ways. One way is that,
you know, there's there's this new type of database which is not really for production usage, but
they're like fit for AI. You know, they spin up quickly in serverless and all this sort of stuff. And
that's kind of interesting. It's not really what we do, but it's made it's out a different set of
constraints for what AI needs.
01:08:41:13 - 01:08:59:13
Sam
The impact it's had on us is large companies creating lots of data that they need for AI and
wanting to keep hold of that data as well as AI. Companies know cursor is a customer of ours,
and we use cursor. So it's really fun to like be in the loop and there's some new features that
shipping that we have access to that we're integrating with.
01:08:59:13 - 01:09:22:10
Sam
And that's extremely cool itself. Like there's just you know, it's it's it's it's impacting databases in
so many ways. One of them being that we're using a ton of AI to actually write the software that
we use. And that's fun. And it's creating new usage patterns and new things at scale. And that's
extremely fun. Yeah, it's just brought more load, more demand, more concurrency.
01:09:22:10 - 01:09:35:01
Sam
And that's to me is makes for more fun database problems. Which I love, which I really love. It's
had a fantastic impact on all of all of us.
01:09:35:01 - 01:09:42:08
Stefan
Well said. Jens, any final questions before we wrap up?
01:09:42:10 - 01:09:45:27
Jens
I think this this episode was super interesting.
01:09:45:29 - 01:09:53:28
Stefan
Thank you for letting me know. Sam. This was absolutely fantastic. So for the audience guys,
we are back next week at our regular scheduled time. We actually might move it to be 1.0.
01:09:53:28 - 01:09:56:08
Jens
No, Stefan, that's not how we do it.
01:09:56:11 - 01:09:58:17
Stefan
Okay, what's the good thing?
01:09:58:19 - 01:10:05:10
Jens
The good thing is. Well, no we're not. Back next week, next week. Right.
01:10:05:13 - 01:10:18:07
Stefan
Well, I am, but regardless, Sam, thank you so much for joining us. Honestly, this was a really,
really exciting discussion. I'm excited about the future of Planet Scale. I'm excited about what
you guys are building with AI and just congratulations for your success so far. And thanks for
joining us.
01:10:18:10 - 01:10:21:13
Sam
Thank you so much for having me, folks. Really fun being here.
01:10:21:16 - 01:10:22:01
Jens
Awesome. Awesome.
01:10:22:05 - 01:10:23:26
Stefan
Thanks. We'll see you guys. Bye, guys.
01:10:23:29 - 01:10:26:10
Sam
Right.
01:10:26:13 - 01:10:27:11
Stefan
It goes a couple seconds.
