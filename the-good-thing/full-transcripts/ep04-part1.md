Episode 4
00:00:24:00 - 00:00:34:09
Stefan
And we're live. Hello, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of The Good Thing, hosted
by me, Stefan and my co-host, Jens. Jens how are you doing today?
00:00:34:12 - 00:00:39:12
Jens
With the words of Sergei. It's okay.
00:00:39:15 - 00:00:45:16
Stefan
For those of you that don't know, Sergei is our one of our founding engineers. Actually, he was
like the first person you recruited, right?
00:00:45:16 - 00:00:47:05
Jens
engineer number one.
00:00:47:07 - 00:00:56:03
Stefan
Yeah, he was engineer number one even before we got the the funding Jens was like, I know
who we're hiring. And I think you hired him right before the money came in.
00:00:56:05 - 00:01:00:15
Jens
Yes. We couldn't afford him. Yet.
00:01:00:18 - 00:01:16:15
Stefan
And then we still hired him. That was crazy. But, Yeah. So, guys, thanks so much for joining us
today. I actually got some feedback from my little sister, and she was like, I like the podcast, but
Stefan, your it's not casual enough. It needs to be more casual like you. And Jens have known
each other for 3 or 4 years.
00:01:16:15 - 00:01:33:16
Stefan
And I was like, you know what? Yeah, that's absolutely right. She's like, you need to be a little bit
more, controversial. And she's like, you need to talk about the things you see in your thing. And I
was like, you know what? It's actually very good feedback. And so today we're going to talk a
little bit different and just going to be meeting me and hanging out drinking some foxy, which is
Dustin's favorite beer.
00:01:33:18 - 00:01:34:10
Stefan
It's actually eating.
00:01:34:13 - 00:01:35:18
Jens
Dont have any
00:01:35:20 - 00:01:49:01
Stefan
I know. But if we could be we could be chilling like at a pub, and we're just going to kind of talk
about what's been going on in, I guess, our lives, what's been going on in the dev tool space
and just kind of things you've seen as a founder, what do you think?
00:01:49:04 - 00:01:52:09
Jens
So we play like, Ricky Gervais.
00:01:52:11 - 00:01:58:23
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. I mean, honestly, he's my favorite comedian. I think you like him too, right?
00:01:58:25 - 00:02:11:22
Jens
I don't actually know him as a comedian. I only know the the when he does the, the moderation
of of the globes and such. And, I don't know, it's it's hilarious. Love him.
Yeah. Where he just ripped up every single celebrity. And then I don't think he was invited back.
00:02:11:24 - 00:02:17:29
Stefan
Right.
00:02:18:01 - 00:02:22:24
Jens
I'm not sure he came, like, four times. I'm not watching this kind of stuff.
00:02:22:24 - 00:02:47:19
Stefan
Just the road. No, that's fair, but, Ricky. Gervais, he's good, he's good. I like him, but one thing
that has been on my mind is, especially with us. So for those of you that know, like, we've been
a dev tool startup from the beginning and recently, we're not a dev tools startup anymore. Jens
what would you call us?
00:02:47:21 - 00:02:48:18
Stefan
00:02:48:21 - 00:03:15:20
Jens
I'm actually currently working on on a next version of our, this morning, I started to be a bit
creative in terms of texting, and I started working a bit on, on, like a new landing page, like a
new hero and everything. And I was thinking about, like, because we were we're slowly
transitioning in from what we where what we're going to be in the future, these kind of things.
00:03:15:22 - 00:03:43:10
Jens
It's actually really hard to come up with a good hero. Like it's insanely hard. And I mean, in our
journey, one one big thing I have observed is that in the very beginning, you know, I still
remember this when I was talking to to to some friends about, starting wundergraph. I still
remember how in the very early days I said, like, I want to build a devtool company, I don't want
to have sales people.
00:03:43:17 - 00:04:36:03
Jens
I just want everybody to self sign up and use the service and whatnot. And like, I don't like
saying like, sales is bad, like sales people are annoying and I really didn't like it. And and
enterprise deals, they they suck and it's annoying and it's awful and procurement go away. And,
so we started wundergraph, like a dev tool company, but I don't know, over the last 2 or 3 years
for me, like a big realization kind of is there are no dev tool startups, at least not those who
survive because if you think about it, do you know any real dev tool company at a series B or
something that's
00:04:36:03 - 00:05:02:01
Jens
actually thriving? Like the only one I would say that comes? Or which dev tool companies do
you actually know who are really successful beyond the series a so they they have like real
revenue. It's it's growing and it's working and they are working towards an IPO or something.
Which dev tool company do you know.
00:05:02:03 - 00:05:20:08
Stefan
I don't so the only two that I can think of which is funny because they're their competitors is
super base and neon. Those are the only two like true dev tool companies I can think of. I don't
know that. Not really. Not really any.
00:05:20:11 - 00:05:23:21
Jens
SuperBase is a bit more like backend as a service, right?
00:05:23:23 - 00:05:52:06
Stefan
Yeah. But like they're starting to pivot because, one of their biggest use cases is hosted
Postgres, which is the same thing that neon does. And people have been preferring to just use
super base. As for one functionality, which is host to Postgres, and that's what they raised their
series C on, if you saw is that they they pivoted from backend as a service to AI hosted
Postgres for your AI apps, and they have some enterprise customers, but those are the only two
companies I can actually think of.
00:05:52:06 - 00:05:57:13
Stefan
And then they fall in the category of databases if they're not even developer tools, anyone.
00:05:57:16 - 00:06:00:26
Jens
What do you think about Vercel?
00:06:00:28 - 00:06:20:29
Stefan
So, Vercel, I don't think it's, like it is a developer tool at the very beginning, but I don't think with
their marketing and everything, now that they are a developer tool anymore, I think that, I mean,
they have 100 million ARR, they're growing like crazy. They raised the series D I, they, I think
they will IPO. But for Vercel.
00:06:21:01 - 00:06:26:24
Stefan
Yeah, I don't see them any more as a developer tool.
00:06:26:26 - 00:06:56:15
Jens
And. Yeah I don't know. So from, from my perspective you can you can start being a dev tool
company. You can think you're a dev tool company. But if you want to build like a successful
startup, that's only one way because think about like just just the other day I saw something like,
I saw a post from from Theo.
00:06:56:18 - 00:07:24:24
Jens
He was talking about, like, he's building some AI whatever thing, like he builds things. We know
that. But, he he did a post and he said something like, blah, blah, blah. See how much value
you get for $8 a month? And to be honest, like in my life, I never want to create anything again
that sells for $8 a month because I don't know that.
00:07:24:27 - 00:07:55:09
Jens
What a miserable life like. Imagine you have like like, okay, let's let's do a little bit of math. $8,
ten customers, 80 bucks, a hundred customers, 800 bucks, a thousand customers. Eight. What
is it, eight K so 8000 MRR. And you have eight. What 8000 customers, right?
00:07:55:12 - 00:07:56:21
Stefan
Yeah.
00:07:56:23 - 00:08:03:18
Jens
Like, how do you do support for 8000 people with eight K MRR?
00:08:03:20 - 00:08:06:04
Stefan
It's actually a thousand customers. So a thousand.
00:08:06:07 - 00:08:09:12
Jens
Okay. Yeah. It's all still a thousand customers.
00:08:09:12 - 00:08:31:16
Stefan
So on I mean support for them is like a high tech. Like there's no personalization like you're just
talking to them. But imagine if you had 10,000 customers. It's 80,000. So you just broke 1
million ARR with 80,000, MRR but 10,000 customers. It doesn't make any point at that scale.
00:08:31:18 - 00:08:59:29
Jens
To 10,000 customers. How many support stuff will you have? How many engineers working on
the product for? For a million ARR. And depending on where you hire them, you won't get very
far. So I don't know, like in, in, in general, I also what I also found is theres a correlation between
what people pay and how they behave.
00:08:59:29 - 00:09:32:00
Jens
And for whatever reason, somehow the people who pay more, they treat you better. They they
treat you with with more respect. The worst customer interactions I ever had was with people
who came in, and they tried extremely hard to haggle you down and then like, like they wanted
to have like, crazy price and then customer interaction. They were extremely, extremely
demanding.
00:09:32:03 - 00:10:07:25
Jens
They never respected the time. And they they wanted everything, every feature. And they just
just, I don't know, super annoying. And, I don't know, for me, I'm, I'm kind of done with, with, like
tiny, like tiny tiny like super tiny markets. What I really love is self-serve. That kind of starts at
like $500. So for example, if you if you look at, like, Cosmo, like obviously our money like the,
the big money, we're making it from enterprise.
00:10:08:00 - 00:10:39:27
Jens
Sure. That's that's clear. But you might be thinking, okay, if people are successful in enterprise,
will they abandon mid-market? And I have to say, I absolutely love mid-market. So, for example,
our our mid-market pricing, it's it's self-serve. It starts from $500. It's goes, up to 3500 for the
month for like a bigger package. And we, we really love our, our customers in this area.
00:10:39:29 - 00:11:09:05
Jens
They get a decent amount of value. They treat us in a in a very respectful way. We have good
relationships. They give us good feedback. They help us, improve the product. And, yeah, I
really like these these relationships. Enterprise is different. Enterprise in some sense. They have
like different requirements. They, they are more strict in terms of like, security and other other
things.
00:11:09:05 - 00:11:34:12
Jens
And they need like specialized logging and they, they can go crazy on things like Opentelemetry
and Prometheus and all these kind of things, which is totally fine. They pay more. They are
more demanding. But for me, I'm, I, I'm done with like, tiny market. And it's not that I don't like
the people or something. It's it's just, I would say it's it's a matter of preference.
00:11:34:15 - 00:12:04:23
Jens
I personally don't like to build, like, consumer or directly like individual dev facing things. What
where where I found most I would say most fun is when we can enable multiple teams working
together, like the collaborative part. Like, I think building a tool, it's great. And building like
something like, like cosmo router or, you know, query planning all these things.
00:12:04:23 - 00:12:33:10
Jens
It's great. But what really excites me is if we can enable the whole organization to collaborate
better. And it's so often that you see, like teams building silos, teams not not talking to each
other. And, and, all these kind of communication problems, being able to solve this kind of stuff,
helping teams collaborate more things like schema design, all this, this kind of stuff.
00:12:33:12 - 00:12:46:01
Jens
It it actually feels like we're not just selling something, but we're we're really helping them to, to
collaborate better. And, it's fun. Yeah.
00:12:46:04 - 00:12:54:25
Stefan
And like, I would agree, like for those who don't know, know we use have a product called
Cosmo Cloud. And, the pricing started at like $25 a month, and we mean.
00:12:54:26 - 00:12:56:00
Jens
WunderGraph cloud.
00:12:56:03 - 00:13:12:27
Stefan
What did I say? Oh, yeah, I wonder graph cloud. So I WunderGraph Cloud. It was an easy way
to deploy the SDK. And our pricing started at $25 a month. And the customers that we got on
$25 a month, they were abusive. They were yelling at us. They were asking for feature requests,
only paying $25 a month.
00:13:12:27 - 00:13:29:21
Stefan
And then the craziest one was, we had like a small outage because we were relying on fly and a
$25 a month customer hopped on a call with us and was demanding that, we need to refund
them the whole year. Because you remember they said they had an SLA and we were like, it's a
$25 plan.
00:13:29:21 - 00:13:54:02
Stefan
You can't have an SLA on a $25 plan. You can on one of our more premium packages. But
that's that's not how it is. And what I found is it's actually harder, much harder to sell a cheaper
product than it is a more expensive product. The more expensive product, it's actually easier to
sell than a more cheaper product, because the type of people that you're dealing with and it's
actually kind of funny, there's always a meme where it's like $5 client.
00:13:54:02 - 00:14:14:07
Stefan
It's like, can we can we hedge against some risk? Can we have a 30 day money day policy?
And then it's like $300,000 client where do I sign? No problem. And so I mean it's crazy. And I
also feel the exact same way. Like if you're building a VC backed like dev tools company, you
have to go into enterprise.
00:14:14:10 - 00:14:39:23
Stefan
If you look at every successful dev tool company or enterprise software company, they make
their money from enterprise enterprise is. The end goal, which is why there's things like Soc2.
That's why there's things like compliance, because you start as a startup, and the end goal is to
get into the big companies, because that's where the money is. And I don't see a way a dev tool
company can do that without ever, ever actually going into enterprise, even super base.
00:14:39:26 - 00:14:57:19
Stefan
They're trying to go into enterprise. They have Google using their tooling to spin up MVP's and
things like that. But hey, at least they're in an enterprise. And so I don't know if you have any
more thoughts on that is like Jens, it's weird to me that people would build a dev tool company
without the angle of trying to go into enterprise.
00:14:57:21 - 00:15:24:21
Jens
I would slightly rephrase it because you don't go into enterprise because there is more money. I
would say because you can't just sell an empty box for for a lot of money. But actually you go
into enterprise because you can bring more value to them and it's a it's a very simple thing. The
the amount of value you can bring to a single developer.
00:15:24:28 - 00:15:49:26
Jens
It's just completely different compared to we're building a solution that enables 100 people to
accomplish a goal together. It's just you have so much more leverage in creating value, which
then this value translates to what you can charge for that. So because like we were, you know,
we were we're not like it's not like, robbing a bank or something.
00:15:50:00 - 00:16:17:05
Jens
You can't. Yeah. You need to bring value and, and, I think I'm one very big I mean, in retrospect,
it's it's so obvious. But, if you build a, you know, like, super simple startup advice, if you don't,
don't do it like us. Do it like smart people. Build anything. It really doesn't matter what you do in
the beginning.
00:16:17:07 - 00:16:51:03
Jens
Just build whatever and somehow get somehow build relationships with big companies and
through whatever you have built, talk to them, ask questions, listen and figure out what other big
problems do they have and can you bring value? And and then you you iterate. And if you listen
to enough people and if you see patterns and then eventually you build a Cosmo and and solve
it, and then yeah, then you start expanding.
00:16:51:03 - 00:17:21:20
Jens
So in the beginning, like, you know, when we started out, I had like all sorts of visions and
whatnot, and it really doesn't matter because, of course you need to have the ability to see
something in the market that others don't see. It's very important. But ultimately just connect,
connect with with customers with the right kind of customers, with customers who have who
have problems that they are willing to pay for, find the pattern.
00:17:21:20 - 00:17:51:23
Jens
And then, yeah, it sounds so easy. But oftentimes especially like technical founders, like I fell
into the same trap. You you are a bit shy. You're afraid of talking to people because if you have a
great idea and you talk to people, it is possible that your that your bubble pops. Like the moment
you ask people like, hey, I have this wonderful thing.
00:17:51:23 - 00:18:13:18
Jens
And the moment you ask people about it, like reality kicks in and it means you have to stop
building. So the the best thing is, if you don't ever talk to anybody, you can just keep building.
It's like building is so much fun. If you're young, you have infinite runway, you live with your
parents, whatever. Like you don't need money so you can build forever.
00:18:13:21 - 00:18:38:21
Jens
But yeah, it's it's, it's a great way of learning how to build software. It's the worst way of learning
how to build a business. And then the the the hard truth is, if you're a technical founder and you
want to build a business, either you or your co-founder, someone has to be like, really interested
in talking to people and solving problems for them.
00:18:38:21 - 00:18:52:09
Jens
And the biggest part of that is actually not writing code. It's talking, listening, asking the right
questions and, and, understanding the market and it's hard.
00:18:52:12 - 00:19:11:03
Stefan
Yeah, but but I think you missed one key thing there though is like, you should talk to these big
companies, but they should pay you, right. Any amount they need to put a credit card or
something. Because you remember the early days of Wunder Graph SDK we talked to? I'm not
going to say their name, but we talked to a company for how long we had slack connect with
them.
00:19:11:09 - 00:19:23:18
Stefan
We built stuff for them and they just kept, well know this huge brand. Everybody knows it. And
we talked to them for months, almost a whole year. They never put their money where their
mouth is. They never purchased anything from us.
00:19:23:21 - 00:19:53:05
Jens
Yeah. This is the very dangerous thing like story. What happened to us? Big company engineer
wants to achieve a goal. I cannot blame them. They just try to do something. And they told us if
you could, like, we could stop procurement. But actually we can't because yeah, your software
is lacking something. And our software was open source. So they said like, could you not fix this
bug or add this feature?
00:19:53:07 - 00:20:23:13
Jens
Then I could go to my manager and do whatever. And this is not how you build a business
because you want to solve a problem where there is willingness to pay. And if they don't let you
through to the manager, what it actually means is yes, there is a problem and there is interest to
solve it, but actually not enough pressure to to convince the manager.
00:20:23:13 - 00:20:47:25
Jens
So they want don't want to put their name on the line. They want don't want to risk anything. So
if the guy you're talking to, if they are not willing to risk anything, if nobody wants to pay, is it
really an important problem that you should be solving? Is there is there a business? If people
ask you to do stuff for free?
00:20:47:28 - 00:21:08:16
Stefan
No, and there's not. And when I was in San Francisco, I met the founder of zip. Zip is like a
procurement software. And when they first started out, you know, this Jens, they, they got ten
customers and, they got them to pay. And for three months, they didn't give them the software
they were building it at, like, they didn't have it yet.
00:21:08:16 - 00:21:25:24
Stefan
They were just out, but they got them to pay. But it's exactly what you said. The problem was so
big that this head of procurement was willing to put their credit card down and say here and like,
I will help you build it. I will give you the feedback because I need something like this. That's
literally how they pitch.
00:21:25:25 - 00:21:46:24
Stefan
They were like, I will build you the perfect solution, but you have to pay for it. And for three
months they didn't get the software, they didn't give it to them, but they built it with them. And
then now they just raised a series D and they have their basically the procurement software
now. But it's exactly what you said is that people were willing to pay for it because it was such a
big enough problem that they were willing to wait three months of not even having a solution.
00:21:46:28 - 00:22:00:12
Stefan
Would you trust a random company with your credit card if they don't give you the solution? Not
unless the problem that you actually have is something you're willing to bet against. So yeah, I, I
agree with you. It's kind of crazy and.
00:22:00:14 - 00:22:17:24
Jens
It but it can also go the other way around. So sometimes you meet startup founders who clearly
they clearly mess up. They are disconnected from reality. Should we talk about fly?
00:22:17:27 - 00:22:32:19
Stefan
We can talk about fly. We can talk about Apollo. You can talk about Calendly. I mean, it's all
these great companies and they just don't listen. Let's do it. I like it because it bothers me,
especially as a startup founder. But what are your thoughts on fly?
00:22:32:21 - 00:23:00:18
Jens
So when we when when I first learned about fly, the idea of being able to run containers across
the globe and you have like a global load balancer on top, I really I really like the idea because I
always thought, like the Kubernetes API, it's too complicated. And there's services like, like,
DigitalOcean app whatever.
00:23:00:18 - 00:23:01:27
Stefan
Or.
00:23:01:29 - 00:23:23:21
Jens
GCP, they have something to to deploy apps and in a simple way like Fargate or something. But
it's always like all these services, they were kind of slow, and it was really hard to like, I, I quickly
want to build and deploy a container in Frankfurt and another one in the US and another one in
London, and fly allowed me to do this.
00:23:23:21 - 00:24:15:02
Jens
And I thought, that's that's revolutionary. But, they did something that that I thought it's, it's even
it goes beyond that. They created something. It's called fly machines. And I think it's it's such a
brilliant idea. So they take the, they take the, the firecracker API, which is AWS has, built this as
far as I know, it's like an, an abstraction on top of, Linux that gives you like a very simple API to,
to deploy, like containerized workflows on, on hardware, very lightweight, thin wrapper startup
time is extremely fast.
00:24:15:04 - 00:24:41:03
Jens
And this would allow you to put like a go application or a node application like into Frankfurt.
And when a request comes in, because this is such a lightweight, virtual machine, engine, within
a couple milliseconds, it can, it can start this container started up and you can you can build
your business on top and what this allow or what this could allow you to do.
00:24:41:03 - 00:25:05:21
Jens
For example, we tried using this in, in our previous, endeavor with, with Wunder Graph Cloud.
We built a builder service with this. So what this does is we, we took this fly machines API and
we, we put on top, like, CI frameworks so that you can use fly machines to run CI within our
service.
00:25:05:21 - 00:25:32:21
Jens
It it was really cool. Like you, you trigger the CI on when you make a git commit. We start up the
fly machine. We run your work, your workflow. It's all like isolated. Like really cool tech. And
there were just huge problems. We, we had in executing this and it started with. So one of the
biggest issues was, reliability.
00:25:32:23 - 00:25:51:24
Jens
Like the fly had so many outages somehow, I don't know, they just couldn't figure out how to do
it. But we we would have been able to forgive them. However, one where I think one of the, one
of the biggest problems we had with fly is, we.
00:25:51:24 - 00:25:53:02
Stefan
Thought.
00:25:53:04 - 00:26:20:05
Jens
If if fly has this machine's API and gives this to all sorts of vendors to build products on top of
ephemeral machines, we thought, this is like a brilliant move because then, like the whole world,
everybody who runs like ephemeral workflows or the need like, like a fast stopping workload
somewhere in the world, everybody could just use fly API.
00:26:20:05 - 00:26:22:27
Jens
Fly would stabilize and and,
00:26:23:00 - 00:26:24:21
Stefan
Yeah, it's a great it.
00:26:24:24 - 00:27:02:23
Jens
Would be great. But the problem is, for whatever reason, fly wants to be something like Vercel.
Fly wants to be something that is like for individual developers. They are not really targeting us.
And we were never able to talk to the to the founders or anything. And it always seemed like
people who tried to build a platform on top of fly like, not deploy an app, but actually built a
platform for other developers on top of fly machines.
00:27:02:25 - 00:27:24:26
Jens
It always felt like we are not their ICP, they they don't care. And this showed in various things.
They didn't talk to us, they didn't really care about our feedback. We could go to the forum. But
yeah, it's it's not the same thing. And then fly machines in the early days. I'm not sure if they
changed it today, but it didn't really have, like an open API spec or something.
00:27:24:26 - 00:27:46:18
Jens
So, sometimes you were hit by surprises when they, when they changed the behavior of the API
or, or like in general. I just recently talked with someone about this and they said, but the the
statement from fly is if you want to use machines, the only way to really use it is you need to to
use the fly CLI.
00:27:46:21 - 00:28:07:00
Jens
And to be honest, I'm not going to build an integration where in my app I start a CLI and I talk to
the CLI locally while doing an in-flight API request from my users. Like I'm not starting binaries
to talk to you. So like.
00:28:07:02 - 00:28:15:21
Stefan
I don't know, they didn't listen. They didn't listen. And you know what annoys us the most or me?
We had one of the highest support tiers, right? In the early days.
00:28:15:24 - 00:28:25:16
Jens
We like the though in the very beginning there were no support tiers. And then there was
something and we we paid for it. But still it was like, I don't know, support.
00:28:25:16 - 00:28:27:14
Stefan
Like they just.
00:28:27:17 - 00:28:44:19
Jens
Didn't want to help us or talk to us or like sometimes we had outages for like two days. They
didn't really answer like, I don't know, we I, I really, really wanted to use it, but yeah. And they,
they didn't care enough about us.
00:28:44:21 - 00:29:02:26
Stefan
And we see this a lot though. Like like I have a friend. He started a company, which was they do
medical staffing, so they're basically a marketplace. And if you're a nurse and you need to find a
shift, you can go and look on this app and then you can find maybe a shift here at the hospital
next to you.
00:29:02:29 - 00:29:27:18
Stefan
But they started off, sorry. They started off with, surgical centers. So surgical centers are much
smaller. They have maybe 15 employees. Hospitals have thousands. And she told me this thing
that your ICP as you grow changes. So when we first started, it was very niche. It was surgical
centers. Eventually when we got into hospitals, we started to leave the surgical centers because
we were getting too big.
00:29:27:21 - 00:29:47:10
Stefan
The platform was just doing the hospitals. And for me, what I realized with fly. And I see it with
Calendly and I also see with Apollo is that they make the jumps too early. Like for me, why didn't
fly listen to their customers? Why? Why did they throw everybody in the forum? And what was
weird is they had big companies on their logo.
00:29:47:10 - 00:30:04:03
Stefan
big companies were leaving their logo wall. All individual developers were also leaving because
of the support. So what was going on there? Like why? Why were they just not listening to
people like, were they very stubborn on the vision or like, what is your take on that?
00:30:04:06 - 00:30:16:15
Stefan
Like, why would you not listen to your customers? Like YCs things? Listen to your customer?
Jeff Bezos was at you need to obsess on the customer. So why would you not obsess on the
customers?
00:30:16:17 - 00:30:58:03
Jens
It is. It's such a hard question. I like to be honest, I cannot answer. I don't know because, or
indirectly, I really think you should be working on something like especially the founders. They
should be working on something where they really care about about the customer and the
problem. Like for example. And this is also you can also develop it like, in the, in the in the early
days of wundergraph, we were not thinking so much about collaboration teams working
together.
00:30:58:03 - 00:31:21:21
Jens
We were more thinking about like first version of of under graph. I thought like, you know,
coming from tyk, API Gateway Company, I was thinking about I want to build a programable API
gateway because I thought, like, the way Tyk does it is it's stupid. Like, you have a gateway, you
have a dashboard, you go to the dashboard, you you click on things and then you hit save.
00:31:21:23 - 00:31:49:13
Jens
And then it produces a config that then goes to the gateway. And I thought, that's stupid. I want
to do it better. I just want to programmatically change the gateway like I'm a I'm a developer. I
don't want to click the things I want to have the config in git and boom. This was the early days,
but we completely shifted because we yeah, we met a lot of people who who use API gateways
and who use GraphQL.
00:31:49:13 - 00:32:19:06
Jens
And the more we talk with them, the more we realized that the, the biggest problem that large
companies are facing is how do we bring together all these people and let them collaborate on
on APIs? And it kind of became like our thing. And where the more we talk to them and the more
we work with them, it's, it's we're we're digging more and we're I don't know, we're getting we're
getting so excited about this, this problem.
00:32:19:06 - 00:32:54:20
Jens
And it's it's yeah, I know it's interesting. It's fun. So what? To go back to your question, also why,
for example, yeah, Apollo allows us to have this market opportunity, if you ask me, like, what is
the biggest difference Apollo versus versus, wunder graph? I would say they really have
perfected selling. They are really good, like salespeople.
00:32:54:22 - 00:33:00:08
Jens
They have a great process how to do it. We're not so good at selling, actually.
00:33:00:10 - 00:33:01:28
Stefan
We're not.
00:33:02:01 - 00:33:28:00
Jens
Yeah. We're we're we're doing okay. It's fine. But I think the big difference and you can ask all
our customers is how we, we care about this problem, how we care like we're primarily we are
not a sales company. We're we're primarily like an engineering company. And we really care
about okay. We we we I don't know, we, we love to eat up all the, all the problems.
00:33:28:00 - 00:33:58:14
Jens
You know, we will always looking like, okay, we have solved like all these federation things
already. What else can we do? For you were is the next opportunity. And I don't know we we just
like this kind of stuff and yeah, you can see this energy from from our end and, Yeah, I don't
know. So if you're choosing a vendor, find someone who really cares to like, what kind of energy
do you get from the interactions?
00:33:58:14 - 00:34:25:23
Jens
Do they really care to move you forward? Do they really care to help you? Do they like or are
they just trying to to sell you a product? And I think that that can make a huge difference. Also
like internally, if you look at our team, everybody's working on on some very interesting project
and everybody's working on like something that's, that's like very impactful customer feedback
driven.
00:34:25:23 - 00:34:50:24
Jens
And I think it also helps your engineers if they if they work on something where they know, okay,
this this moves the customer forward. You know, we mentioned it in one of our last, last
episodes, this direct feedback loop where you, as an engineer, build something, you give it in
the hands of the customer, and you immediately get feedback on the slack connect.
00:34:50:27 - 00:35:10:27
Jens
It's it's just amazing. And then you maybe you have like a second round, some more feedback.
You you polish it a bit more and then off they go. And then leverage this new feedback. And then
then there's, you know, we, there was this cool. I go into my monologues not too long, right?
00:35:10:29 - 00:35:16:00
Stefan
No, it's fine, it's fine. I'm like, tracking in my head, like things to jump back on, but real quick.
00:35:16:01 - 00:35:18:19
Jens
Yeah, okay. Well, one thing I finished.
00:35:18:19 - 00:35:19:22
Stefan
Finished the monologue.
00:35:19:24 - 00:35:58:06
Jens
Yes. So you you ship something, and then there's this magic moment. It sometimes happens,
and and everybody loves it. It's like, okay, we built something. It's called cache warmer. So we
had a customer they are preparing for, a huge, huge, huge event where they expect Super
Bowl, but they expect insane amount of traffic and they weren't really afraid of can the can the
router sustain the load because they have a bunch of queries that take many seconds to to
plan, like grow planning and GraphQL Federation.
00:35:58:06 - 00:36:28:10
Jens
It's a it's a complex topic. Competitive products. It took them like 50s or longer to plan this
cruise. We were able to put it under 10s. But imagine you are you're in a big event, you scale
our traffic and you have to plan a query for 10s like completely unacceptable. And they tried to
build like custom scripts to to warm up the router before they send the production traffic.
00:36:28:10 - 00:36:55:10
Jens
And it didn't really work. And coming back to this magic moment, they come with the
requirement we build cache warmer. I think it took us a month or two. It was a big effort. We can
talk later about what cache warmer is. And then they did like a pre run with the smaller event
where they prepared everything and they send you a screenshot like you know they.
00:36:55:16 - 00:37:27:19
Jens
Yeah, it's so funny like you do all this work and then they say it's working one screenshot a tiny
screenshot and it shows like the squiggly lines like flaky between eight and 10s. And then
suddenly everything below one second and that's that's like, yeah, this is why we're doing it,
this, this kind of moment. And, that, that was such a great collaboration because, you know, we
didn't know it's such a big problem.
00:37:27:21 - 00:37:42:12
Jens
Like, obviously you you always have like, your backlog is full of stuff, but, yeah, we always try to
find stuff that is really impactful. And yeah, in this case this is the graph.
00:37:42:14 - 00:37:44:05
Stefan
Yeah. There we go.
00:37:44:07 - 00:38:20:29
Jens
So on the left we see like spiking. So this is the maximum time that it took routers to plan
querys. That's in seconds. And we see yeah something flaky between whatever four and 15, 16
seconds. And then suddenly you can see on on, Friday 24, you can see, full deployment of, of
Cosmo Cache, Warmer and, yeah, it seems like everything is below one second, which is
absolutely amazing.
00:38:21:01 - 00:38:45:19
Jens
And yeah, this is just, you know, we really love this collaboration because, we have a long term
vision where we want to go. But in the, in the, in the medium time, like, how can you be you
know, it's it's so easy to say like, hey, like, you know, some, some people in the GraphQL
community, they do this, they say, oh, we have the fastest router, we are the best, blah, blah,
blah.
00:38:45:19 - 00:39:09:00
Jens
We have the best quality. But yeah, but what what we are doing is we we listen, we figure out,
okay, how can we prepare for Super Bowl. We identify the problem. The problem is, is, query
planning time and then we figure out how to solve it. And it's not like, oh, yeah, cache warming,
like super easy.
00:39:09:00 - 00:39:37:17
Jens
No, it's it's a really hard problem because you have directives like skip includes. They can they
can dramatically change. The shape of a query. And then you have processes like normalization
and, and other things you have like inline arguments, all these kind of things. They make
caching query plans in graphical federation very very complex. We have a I have a rabbit in my
garden
