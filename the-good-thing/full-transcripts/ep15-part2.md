00:35:29:18 - 00:35:45:01
type: podcast-chunk
Stefan
Of course, we'll do it after this one. But I love their landing page. Used to be super cool. I think
they might have changed it a little bit, but have you ever seen posthogs? No. I still don't
understand what they do. Okay. So. Okay, it's.
00:35:45:04 - 00:35:50:22
Jens
It's actually cool because I, I don't know the product. So we can now try to figure out what it is.
00:35:50:24 - 00:35:56:10
Stefan
Okay. Let's just you just go through it. So hero text talk to me. Like, what do you think of it so
far?
00:35:56:10 - 00:36:13:22
Jens
How developers build successful products. Okay, that alone, I'm not sure. The single platform to
analyze, test, observe and deploy new features. Is it like feature flags or.
00:36:13:24 - 00:36:31:09
Stefan
Kind of. So they offer a platform that does all of it. I feel like this should be first. Right. And then
this could be second. A single platform to analyze, test, observe and deploy new features. This
is how developers build successful products. What do you think?
00:36:31:11 - 00:36:42:08
Jens
backed company.
Product analytics session replay experiments. Surveys. You know what I see. Is this is a venture
00:36:42:10 - 00:36:45:03
Stefan
Yes, they but they are venture backed.
00:36:45:06 - 00:36:47:16
Jens
Where where are they in the journey?
00:36:47:19 - 00:36:49:03
Stefan
Series B.
00:36:49:06 - 00:36:51:00
Jens
How long do they exist?
00:36:51:02 - 00:36:53:20
Stefan
Three years. 2 or 3 years.
00:36:53:22 - 00:37:28:19
Jens
Yeah. You know what I what I instantly kind of feel to me, it feels like they started somewhere in
the corner and they expanded into everything. And now, you know, product analytics, session,
replay experiments, surveys, product tours, product roadmaps, web analytics, messaging, heat
maps, no code AB testing, LLM observability, prompt evaluation from management. It it feels
like they are doing a little bit of everything.
00:37:28:22 - 00:37:40:27
Stefan
But did you notice, by the way, what it says. So it's the single platform and then it literally shows
you the platform. Like this is the platform.
00:37:40:29 - 00:37:44:17
Jens
It's it's the tool.
00:37:44:20 - 00:37:56:18
Stefan
Okay. These folks by the way I love this little Easter eggs here. These folks build products users
want with post hgc. Look who they put them. They put themselves I kind of love that.
00:37:56:21 - 00:38:01:13
Jens
Okay Y Combinator. So it's a y C company right?
00:38:01:15 - 00:38:22:20
Stefan
Yeah it's a VC company. But then they have this trial. They have Airbus, they have DHL, they
have Zara, Raycast. They don't when you look at it though, they don't have any old modern
enterprises. These are all pretty like raycast as a startup hasura is a startup Airbus is probably
their biggest one. MistralAI is a startup, but you see what I mean?
00:38:22:23 - 00:38:33:27
Jens
Yeah, but you know, the next, the next title, it's already it's it's it's putting me off ten plus
products in one.
00:38:33:27 - 00:38:42:11
Stefan
This is so funny though. Product engineering has never been so lit. But you know what? I.
00:38:42:13 - 00:38:54:19
Jens
I don't know, but to me this feels like they, they got funding or something and, and the market
was too small when they started. I think posthog started in analytics or something. I'm not sure
one.
00:38:54:19 - 00:38:55:09
Stefan
Hundred percent.
00:38:55:09 - 00:39:00:19
Jens
But they expanded into everything. And, I'm not sure. No.
00:39:00:21 - 00:39:21:08
Stefan
Okay. So you're not sure on and not sold probably doesn't do well in Germany. Here we go.
Okay, so post the world. They give it to you right here. Everything we needed to find out. So we
ship weirdly fast. They joined y C W 20. So winter of 20, they launched open source analytics
thousand stars, iOS, Android, react native feature flags.
00:39:21:08 - 00:39:39:09
Stefan
Offside in Italy. Heat maps segment 33,000 stars posthog the platform. Click house support
session. Replay, raise series A wow. So 2020 is this kind of cool? Series B are they on a series
C it Jesus Christ, they do ship pretty fast.
00:39:39:11 - 00:39:48:14
Jens
But you know you know what I'm wondering why? Why is this on the landing page. What what
do I have from it as a customer.
00:39:48:17 - 00:39:59:22
Stefan
So they're telling you how they using their product have shipped fast. Here's everything that
we've shipped fast. You can do it too. If you use our product.
00:39:59:24 - 00:40:01:03
Jens
Okay.
00:40:01:06 - 00:40:26:27
Stefan
That's kind of the story that I'm getting. Okay. And then boom. SDK for web and mobile. They
like to play on the modern stuff. Stranger hogs the crown. Those are like modern shows. Code
examples. Here's what you can do with post hog. So I would say it's like oh this is funny. You will
hate post hog. Like if you enjoyed jumping on a quick call with sales.
00:40:27:00 - 00:40:47:12
Stefan
If you love needlessly wasting company money we only have usage based pricing that
decreases exponentially with scale you'd rather buy before you try. We offer a free tier so large
that only a fraction of our customers pay us anything. Even worse, we are continually trying to
reduce our pricing. You think your email is a good trade for that free whitepaper?
00:40:47:14 - 00:40:54:17
Stefan
Press control w now or ask your network administrator to close your window. These are actually
pretty freaking good. You know what's cool about this?
00:40:54:18 - 00:40:57:15
Jens
That they do objection handling right?
00:40:57:16 - 00:41:08:22
Stefan
On the landing page. It's exactly like you would rather give out your credit card details to
strangers like you're desperate for commitment. Sorry, we don't offer annual commitments
unless you ask for one.
00:41:08:24 - 00:41:14:24
Jens
I really like the the the, how they call it the the hooks, the pictures.
00:41:14:27 - 00:41:34:03
Stefan
Yeah, they're really good. And like, their animation. Like, you like buying a whole product test
suite to get access to one tool. This is quite good, by the way, if you think Csms are your friends,
honey, those emails are automated. The customer success manager. Okay, I actually love this.
You enjoy sitting through hours of training more than using your product.
00:41:34:04 - 00:41:50:24
Stefan
No training is required to use posthog. They do quite good here. Yeah, okay. Overall though,
there we got some customer proof. But overall like being your first impression on posthog. What
do you think so far?
00:41:50:26 - 00:42:26:07
Jens
I think these guys, engineers. And they are, they are, they are engineering a little bit too much. I
think they should be selling more. You know, one one thing I learned from someone, recently is
if you sell to C level and you make it so engineering style-y and you make it like here starts on
GitHub, open source and everything like C level, people might be thinking if it's open source, is
it actually good?
00:42:26:10 - 00:42:48:29
Jens
Like I want proprietary enterprise software. I know it sounds weird, but some people are put off
by open source and stuff like that. I mean, you can still make it open source, but does it need to
be like this on the landing page? And so thus does c level do they care about how much you
ship or what problems you solve for them?
00:42:49:01 - 00:43:16:06
Stefan
The thing about this is I know they do good in revenue. But this they are they're geared towards
the developer. I like them, though. I think they do a good job. But overall, I wanted to show that
one. And now we're going to jump into a really, really amazing one. Honestly, probably my
favorite. API orchestration for the cloud native world.
00:43:16:09 - 00:43:30:20
Stefan
Steam okay. And guys, for all you guys sticking around like yes, we are roasting landing pages.
We're also praising them. But we will be roasting our own the same way that we are doing
these. So yes, stick around till the very end because not even our landing page is safe. No.
00:43:30:21 - 00:43:36:28
Jens
Ors is really bad and I'm, I'm I'm very responsble.
00:43:37:00 - 00:44:05:03
Stefan
That's okay. Well, let's start off with this one first. Some praise. I love the little background how it
moves. I think it gives you all the space Apollo-y. But I'm immediately thrown off by this
buzzword, the cloud native word buzzword API orchestration. I think it's I don't know what it
means. And then this whether your team is new to GraphQL or seasoned experts, learn why
Apollo is the fastest and safest way to build and scale your APIs.
00:44:05:09 - 00:44:18:09
Stefan
To be honest, this could be the hero. Apollo is the fastest and safest way to build and scale your
APIs and then social proof. But I think that they put themselves in a box with this as well as with
this. What do you think?
00:44:18:11 - 00:44:43:17
Jens
So not sure if you know this, but cloud native is a term. It comes from the, from the Kubernetes
community. It is a few years ago that we heavily used the term cloud native. Like, I don't know,
before, before wundergraph like when I worked at the tyk like the, the, the my my when I was at
tonline, for example.
00:44:43:17 - 00:44:46:09
Jens
How many years is that ago? Like 5 to 7.
00:44:46:11 - 00:44:47:19
Stefan
1 million. I.
00:44:47:21 - 00:45:13:09
Jens
I think like five years ago. We use cloud native much more these days. Not so much. Like my
my standard reaction like and by the this is not just roasting Apollo, but I said this to all pages. It
is not active, API orchestration for the cloud native world. It is not active. And I think Apollo has
not as strong a brand as Vercel.
00:45:13:11 - 00:45:29:19
Jens
Like everybody knows. Vercel, who's Apollo like? I don't think so many people know Apollo. If
you ask people about Apollo, many people think you mean Apollo.io this. Yeah. This, thing
where where, you can, You can.
00:45:29:21 - 00:45:31:28
Stefan
What is it like for finding emails? Yeah.
00:45:31:28 - 00:45:32:09
Jens
Finding.
00:45:32:09 - 00:45:36:19
Stefan
Email and stuff like, sequences and stuff like that. It's for, like, salespeople.
00:45:36:21 - 00:46:03:20
Jens
Well, one thing I find interesting is, they brought back the term GraphQL for quite some while
the term GraphQL wasn't really on the landing page. Now it's back. But I also find interesting, I
mean, we we don't have to go into too much depth here, but, they are not even making like, you
know, GraphQL. It's not in the hero, but the company name is Apollo GraphQL.
00:46:03:22 - 00:46:14:06
Jens
You know what, Stefan? Have you ever wondered why I didn't make GraphQL part of the name
WunderGraph?
00:46:14:09 - 00:46:33:02
Stefan
No idea. Why didn't you really? Not like I always wondered it. Like so I think the reason Apollo
does it. Apollo graphql is for SEO, like just so that they can pop up when everyone words it. But
is it so you didn't have to compete? Why didn't you make it a part of the word?
00:46:33:04 - 00:46:44:10
Jens
what are you say?
Yeah, just for everybody. So I started WunderGraph kind of alone, not so super successful, but
00:46:44:12 - 00:46:54:10
Stefan
Okay. No, but.
I was going to put, like, a little, like the world's smallest violin, you know, like started it all alone.
00:46:54:10 - 00:47:18:18
Jens
I started it alone, and then, I didn't want to tie the company to a technology, so I. I like the idea
of having a graph, and I, I don't know, I somehow like the word, I, I wanted to bring a little bit of
German into, into the graph and, I don't know, WunderGraph it seemed cool.
00:47:18:20 - 00:47:46:18
Jens
So, but I didn't want to tie it to GraphQL because I wasn't sure if GraphQL would be forever or if
we somehow would exceed the GraphQL market or whatever. And so, yeah, but also Apollo
figured this out. So now the hero doesn't even mention GraphQL anymore. Just the subtitle.
Okay. So API orchestration for the cloud native world, I, I, I don't know.
00:47:46:18 - 00:47:52:05
Jens
Well, what is API orchestration? Do I needed to say what problem does it solve for me?
00:47:52:07 - 00:48:02:15
Stefan
Hey, by the way, since you're a CEO and you're looking to buy a new technology, what? How
does this stand out to you?
00:48:02:17 - 00:48:29:23
Jens
Well, let's read the subtitle. As a CEO. Whether Your team is new to GraphQL or seasoned
experts, learn why Apollo is the fastest and safest way to build and scale your APIs. So as a
CEO, I don't know what GraphQL is.
00:48:29:25 - 00:48:42:23
Jens
Yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe I know what APIs are. Maybe I don't. Yeah, I also don't want to just
make a stupid rant or map.
00:48:42:26 - 00:48:46:22
Stefan
I don't know. Yeah. You know what my favorite detail is though?
00:48:46:24 - 00:48:47:28
Jens
Yeah.
00:48:48:00 - 00:48:54:00
Stefan
Let me point to it. This tiny little animation like what is that.
00:48:54:02 - 00:48:59:06
Jens
It's just it's just a cool animation. Can you click on why API orchestration.
00:48:59:08 - 00:49:11:19
Stefan
Yeah, but if you notice it's us chasing Apollo. You see. And then eventually we eat the. Okay.
And boom. Text wall.
00:49:11:21 - 00:49:43:03
Jens
Okay Matt explains API orchestration rapidly deliver seamless experiences with lower risk. It's
very that is a very, business focused modern apps require integrating multiple APIs, but custom
backend codes to aggregate, transform and deliver them slows teams down. Actually, I did an
interview two years ago with Matt Douglas at the GraphQL. Com he he said something kind of
like that and, I, I agree with him.
00:49:43:03 - 00:50:17:03
Jens
It's it's true, custom backend code to aggregate, transform and, bring APIs to the graph. It's it's a
burden. Apollo's declarative, standards based, GraphQL powered platform. By the way, I
disagree with this. There is little details in how Apollo is not following the GraphQL spec
sometimes, and for backwards compatibility, compatibility reasons, they somehow are unable to
remove those bugs or.
00:50:17:05 - 00:50:41:09
Jens
Yeah, but no, nobody will know about this. You only learn about this when you migrate a
customer from Apollo to WunderGraph, and you have to add feature flags so that we tell our
router to do stupid things. And we really hate it. But it's it's okay. We're we're doing it. I don't
want to roast Matt. I actually like Matt.
00:50:41:09 - 00:50:48:04
Jens
I think he's, he's a very smart engineer. And I, met him in person, and, he's a he's a good guy.
00:50:48:07 - 00:50:54:25
Stefan
Okay, let's go back to the main one, because we are almost at time, so we got ten minutes.
We'll do this one couple more, and then we'll,
00:50:54:27 - 00:50:57:08
Jens
We also need to roast our own page.
00:50:57:10 - 00:51:01:00
Stefan
Actually, that's for next episode. No, I'm just kidding. We actually have to.
00:51:01:03 - 00:51:04:06
Jens
Okay, scroll a little bit. Let's let's see what's going on.
00:51:04:08 - 00:51:22:00
Stefan
Okay. Social proof. But again, my biggest problem here is it doesn't tell you like who what
trusted by. But I don't know if these are oh they're not clickable. So they're not clickable. You just
pause it I think that's kind of stupid. They should link to their case studies. thoughts?
00:51:22:02 - 00:51:28:13
Jens
Yeah. All of these customers or users or. What are they?
00:51:28:15 - 00:52:02:12
Stefan
I don't know. I have no idea, to be honest. I know what you're thinking. It's funny, but. Okay, let's
move on. Okay? Okay. Boom. New product. Introducing Apollo connectors. Accelerate app
development with Apollo connectors. Bring all APIs together in minutes on a declarative, query
based GraphQL platform. Very technical power. Any app with real time data aren't most apps
powered with real time data and then build, debug, and deploy faster than ever.
00:52:02:12 - 00:52:12:06
Stefan
Okay, that one's interesting and then interactive tutorial. Learn more. See in action. I'm really
struggling with their landing page. I'm not going to lie.
00:52:12:09 - 00:52:36:16
Jens
I have one one thing here. Bring all APIs together in minutes on a declarative query based
GraphQL platform. You know what? Remove query based? Can you Mark query based? Okay,
remove it and read this again.
00:52:36:18 - 00:52:41:07
Stefan
Accelerate app development with apollo connectors bring all I know just this one sentence.
00:52:41:10 - 00:52:42:09
Jens
Now just this one.
00:52:42:09 - 00:52:48:14
Stefan
Bring all APIs together in minutes on a declarative GraphQL platform.
00:52:48:16 - 00:53:13:15
Jens
What what a query based even mean here? I think, you know, I think what happened is, I know
how hard it is to to find this right wording, but to me, it looks like they put together a list of words
they want to have here, and somehow they put them into sentences. But declarative query
based GraphQL platform?
00:53:13:17 - 00:53:18:28
Stefan
Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't even understand what problem Apollo Connector solves. For me, it's
very, very technical.
00:53:18:28 - 00:53:43:26
Jens
I know what it does. I can tell you what's. So let's improve the landing page of Apollo. Okay?
Like okay. The real problem Apollo Connector solves is. Instead of writing a subgraph, you can
now just write a bunch of directives to connect an existing Rest API. It saves you a ton of time
and you don't have to deploy a subgraph.
00:53:43:26 - 00:53:46:05
Jens
This should be here.
00:53:46:07 - 00:54:10:08
Stefan
Stop deploying subgraph. I still think it's to focus especially towards the GraphQL space, but
okay, they can deal with that. And then next building intelligence experiences on graph OS gain
security and dynamic access to any data in context using GraphQL. Okay, built for rapid.
There's our AI angle. Start with low code. I don't know because they were saying declarative
query above.
00:54:10:08 - 00:54:25:27
Stefan
Now it's low code. Deploy fast and governance AI workflows. This will this also feels all over the
place like it's like what you said. We want to include AI. We want to include rapid. We want to
include low code chatGPT throw it what it means it to there. I don’t get this.
00:54:25:29 - 00:54:46:00
Jens
You know, by by the way they have a brand inconsistency because yesterday they did a
workshop where they say, Apollo connectors is no code here. They say low code. I think they
should all agree on what they are.
00:54:46:03 - 00:54:51:26
Stefan
I'm not boom. I like this.
00:54:51:28 - 00:54:57:05
Jens
Yes, but you know what's funny? Can you. Okay, read this out.
00:54:57:08 - 00:55:01:02
Stefan
Deliver tomorrow's roadmap today with Apollo.
00:55:01:05 - 00:55:08:06
Jens
Okay. Now open konghq.com.
00:55:08:08 - 00:55:10:21
Stefan
Look.
00:55:10:24 - 00:55:13:07
Jens
I'm, I'm a landing page specialist.
00:55:13:07 - 00:55:24:25
Stefan
No, no, honestly, we've been we've been trying to rewrite our landing page, which coming soon,
so you'll see it. All right, so here's Kong and their hero is. It starts off with there are no API.
00:55:24:27 - 00:55:34:28
Jens
No, it's not about we don't roast them. But the search for tomorrow is like.
00:55:35:00 - 00:55:40:03
Stefan
For today. And tomorrow's API needs. Yeah.
00:55:40:04 - 00:55:46:05
Jens
Someone looked at the Kong website.
00:55:46:07 - 00:55:48:26
Stefan
I mean, it doesn't make sense.
00:55:48:28 - 00:55:59:19
Jens
Yeah. Of course. Okay. Go go go back to to Apollo. We're we're not done. And we we need to
look at the time and roast ourselves. We can go a little bit over if you want to.
00:55:59:22 - 00:56:18:10
Stefan
But, give it a sec I already told the person we're having a meeting with where we'll be running
late, so no worries. Where is our amazing friends? Okay, cool. So now we're back again. Similar
to Kong. Okay, this is cool animation, by the way, but it's way too fast and it doesn't redo it
again. Okay, here we go.
00:56:18:12 - 00:56:43:25
Stefan
Oh it does. That was cool okay. define data once deliver everywhere. Eliminate accumulative
technical debt from back end from front end or experienced API. If GraphQL federation provides
a secure source of truth for the data that powers your business, I'm still missing the business
impact. Like okay, I get remove technical debt, but I still feel that's like two tech two technical.
00:56:44:00 - 00:57:00:04
Stefan
Like any company that's successful, they will always have technical debt. It's a byproduct of
your success. So I'm wondering like where is the quantifiable success? Hey, this company
removed I don't know this much. And this is what they say. You know what I mean?
00:57:00:07 - 00:57:12:00
Jens
They could do it more like vercel where they say, company X reduced boilerplate by 40%.
That's. What you mean?
00:57:12:02 - 00:57:27:02
Stefan
Yeah, like it reduced boilerplate that. Can teams contribute to a unified and composable API?
Okay, but what is the trade off like? What do I do when they're contributing to the graph? How
much time did they save? How much of technical debt, how many lines of code did you know?
00:57:27:02 - 00:57:37:05
Jens
You know what they are doing? I mean, we we understand the space a little bit. Now they are
trying to feed to to spoon feed us. Federation.
00:57:37:07 - 00:57:53:29
Stefan
Yeah. I'm not in love with it. Okay, here we go. Here's finally one. Deliver features faster. Yes,
but where is the numbers? They're also, streamlining federation here as well.
00:57:54:01 - 00:57:58:13
Jens
I like the, the, the visuals on our left side.
00:57:58:16 - 00:58:12:08
Stefan
Me too. I like to schema checks the workflow. This is good. Improve performance. Okay, but
show me, how did you guys improve performance? This is awesome. This is really cool. Oh,
that's that's it.
00:58:12:10 - 00:58:21:04
Jens
You know what I find funny about the animation on the left? On the left side. Yeah. They have
reviews and it has this, this exclamation mark. Right.
00:58:21:07 - 00:58:27:18
Stefan
Okay. Yeah. So it means that I have where is it? Okay. Yeah I see it.
00:58:27:20 - 00:58:29:04
Jens
We are not clicking it.
00:58:29:06 - 00:58:34:28
Stefan
Yeah. Why are we not clicking on the one that actually why why why are we clicking on the one
that is fast.
00:58:35:05 - 00:58:38:03
Jens
9.8 milliseconds. Why are we not clicking.
00:58:38:03 - 00:58:53:12
Stefan
On 15 seconds? Bro, it's so funny. I just realized that look improve performance across
application and then you clearly have one that has an issue 15 milliseconds. And we don't click
on it. We go right past it. That's actually kind of funny okay. That's amazing. Yes.
00:58:53:13 - 00:58:55:25
Jens
But the animation is cool okay.
00:58:55:25 - 00:59:14:24
Stefan
And then you know what's crazy? Like if you can see my bar down here, look how much I've
had to scroll to get the social proof. Like this should be at the top. Look at these logos. Look at
the names of the people. A he looks familiar. There's a couple people here that look familiar, but
I'm not going to say anything.
00:59:14:26 - 00:59:25:20
Stefan
This is okay, this is good. And then a lot of white space here. Isn't that crazy? Okay, I.
00:59:25:20 - 00:59:29:29
Jens
Think over all the pages is okay.
00:59:30:01 - 00:59:38:06
Stefan
And for those of you that, are not familiar with Germans, okay, can either mean really bad or
really good, but I'll let you guys decide.
00:59:38:08 - 00:59:40:18
Jens
But it's okay.
00:59:40:20 - 01:00:07:28
Stefan
Okay. As we promised, we will also be roasting our landing page. And no, we were not be taking
it easy. So let us go for the last one of today. The amazing, the fantastic and much needed
improvement WunderGraph. So let's start with the hero, the open source GraphQL Federation
solution. I don't know what that means if I was not anybody else other than myself.
01:00:07:29 - 01:00:21:04
Stefan
Okay, okay. Open source GraphQL Federation solution. First of all, it's kind of a mouthful. Open
source GraphQL Federation solution. What are your thoughts?
01:00:21:07 - 01:00:47:04
Jens
So if you know what GraphQL Federation is and for some reason you you don't like closed
source GraphQL federation, then open source GraphQL Federation. Sounds like a good a good
thing to look into. But yeah, that is also the problem of this hero.
01:00:47:06 - 01:01:00:00
Stefan
Okay. And then this is where it gets really funny. And Dustin I'm sorry, but this was Dustin, our
CTO that wrote this part. But we kept it for a, what do you mean full lifecycle API management
for implement?
01:01:00:00 - 01:01:01:21
Jens
I think I wrote this.
01:01:01:23 - 01:01:24:00
Stefan
Okay with you. Okay. So it was you. It's straight up developer talk, schema registry composition
checks, analytics metrics tracing. It's a huge run on sentence. It's it's it's basically trying to get
everything into the sub hero Apache 2.0. No vendor like managed servers just as much as you
can squeeze it. And yeah like all the benefit.
01:01:24:02 - 01:01:26:20
Jens
It's the it's the the elevator feature list.
01:01:26:21 - 01:01:43:19
Stefan
This and then as they like buyer like let's say I'm a CTO or whatever. I don't know much about
GraphQL federation, but I'm looking for a solution for, I don't know, API sprawl or some business
problem that I have. I have no idea if this is even solves my business.
01:01:43:19 - 01:01:49:01
Jens
Problem, but the ICP of this landing page is not what you just said.
01:01:49:04 - 01:01:58:00
Stefan
I know, I know what the ICP is and we hit the ICP, but I was just saying if we're generally
roasting it. Not a fan. Yeah.
01:01:58:01 - 01:02:04:16
Jens
No, this this hero is really bad. So I don't know maybe to two out of ten points okay.
01:02:04:16 - 01:02:26:29
Stefan
Two out of ten. And then if we dive deeper this I love platform engineering. Engineering teams
love Cosmo okay. So that's some social proof. And here are some of the customers. And then
you jump right into what our customers have to say. I really like this. I love this quote, but as I
mentioned earlier in the episode, this is what I wanted to talk about.
01:02:27:01 - 01:02:48:09
Stefan
Complex queries have seen substantial performance improvements. Cosmo plans queries in a
smarter way. The innovation rate that they're keeping up with is mind blowing. While it is a nice
quote and Frederick is amazing again, from the business point of view, what is the impact of the
complex queries that now that you have a significant performance improvements, it sounds like
your brand, like what is the impact to their customers?
01:02:48:16 - 01:02:52:27
Stefan
You know what I mean?
01:02:52:29 - 01:02:58:28
Jens
The, the, the impact will be that the, their customers can can load the page fast, right?
01:02:59:01 - 01:03:20:25
Stefan
Yeah. But do you remember how Vercel has it is like, hey, Leonardo AI saw 95%, decreases in, I
don't know, website performance or whatever. What are complex queries? Well, how does that
contribute to my customers? What are soundtrack your brand's customers experiencing? So I
think that's something we need to improve. What are your thoughts so far?
01:03:20:28 - 01:03:42:21
Stefan
I also like how we have the video one as well. That's cool. And then the logo and then here this
is cool, but these quotes could be a little bit better. Like okay, a solution that is scalable and PC
compliant. Migrated cosmos superintendent. It took just a day to reconfigure everything. I hope
Brendan is watching because Brendan, we're going to need your help on fixing this.
01:03:42:23 - 01:03:44:00
Stefan
Yeah.
01:03:44:03 - 01:03:46:22
Jens
Okay. Go scroll more.
01:03:46:25 - 01:04:01:26
Stefan
Here we go. Okay, so this one all Jens is so boom. Future of Federation. State of GraphQL
Federation. As a CEO, I want people to know I'm CEO. So I put my own quote on my landing
page. So I'm just kidding. Tell me. Tell me about this one.
01:04:01:26 - 01:04:08:00
Jens
Is.
01:04:08:03 - 01:04:39:28
Jens
So what this is trying to do is it is it is trying to to pitch a message that we know something about
the future, that we understand the market. And we we want to we want to show our expertise.
And there is a full report and you should get it. And, from the interactions with this button, we
know it works.
01:04:40:00 - 01:05:08:05
Stefan
I would say, overall not bad. Scroll down. Built for every use case. Well, that's a bold statement.
Manage GraphQL at any scale from Monolith of Federation. I do like that. And then here we go
into the four core features for our ICP. So Cosmo is a drop in a replacement to other services
like a Apollo GraphOS, it is the only OSA solution that bundles everything from router to
schema, registry, analytics and tracing, and one package perfect for monolithic or federate.
01:05:08:11 - 01:05:14:03
Stefan
I actually don't mind this. This is actually like if what we're aiming for, it's hitting right on the spot.
01:05:14:04 - 01:05:16:07
Jens
It's it's precise right.
01:05:16:09 - 01:05:20:20
Stefan
Yeah. Exactly. It's precise.
01:05:20:22 - 01:05:42:12
Stefan
I also like this animation. Kind of cool okay. So that's good okay. Nice little pop up. And then you
see, you know, I'm, I'm going to cheat a little bit because we have a designer that I like was
going through this thing and like, these are good. But there are two technical like what does the
schema registry unlock from the business.
01:05:42:14 - 01:05:49:02
Stefan
job.
What does the change log unlock? But I think from what we were aiming to do, it does a good
01:05:49:05 - 01:06:23:03
Jens
Features that enable teams to move fast without breaking things. It's not bad. It's also not. It's
not business focused enough. Schema registry like I don't know what what what does it tell
you? Change lock, synchronize changes. Integrations, feature flags. Schema checks. You know,
like one one thing we should actually do is and we have learned this over time.
01:06:23:05 - 01:06:58:00
Jens
So initially we built feature flags for one customer. They actually they used this before they were
migrating from Apollo. They used Apollo Gateway and they built their own feature flag,
mechanism into the gateway, which was pretty insane because what they did is if you send,
specific header to the gateway, the gateway would, on the fly build a custom, a custom super
graph while the request is in flight.
01:06:58:02 - 01:07:22:23
Jens
Think about it. Compose the custom feature flag subgraph into a schema and then resolve it. So
first of all, that was like super slow. And second, if something goes wrong in this composition,
then it just wouldn't work. And also it would put like crazy, crazy workload on the on the gateway
because the gateway would have to do composition at that point.
01:07:22:25 - 01:07:50:09
Jens
Composition is expensive, like it's a CPU intensive task. It can it can stop the world on the
Node.js gateway for a second or two. Like it's crazy. So we we built a version of feature flags
that works at compile time, and we build it into into Cosmo router. And what we have learned
over time is almost every of our customers is building workflows around feature flags.
01:07:50:09 - 01:08:14:18
Jens
It is such a powerful tool that you can have multiple versions of your graph on one router, and
you can run that under feature flags and we need to make that much more prominent because
it's such a, such a widely used and, broadly adopted feature. And here it is. It's just a little box
and it doesn't really tell you like how strong it is.
01:08:14:21 - 01:08:38:15
Jens
And so yeah, and also I think our schema checks over time, like we have really we have put a
lot of work into this. We you know, we have graph pruning. We now have checks with proposals
like there are so many things I think we should really revisit this part and talk more about what
feature flags enables our customers to do and what the schema checks do.
01:08:38:15 - 01:08:42:18
Jens
So these are, I think, the the most powerful things here.
01:08:42:20 - 01:08:55:09
Stefan
I would say that I would agree with all that. Like there's not really we're talking about the
customer use cases here. Like, no, you put feature flags in a tiny little box, but it's actually such
a powerful feature. Same thing with all of these. So a lot of work to be done there.
01:08:55:10 - 01:09:03:22
Jens
But but you know, like don't just put features on a landing page like what are you ready to
benefit for the customer?
01:09:03:24 - 01:09:20:16
Stefan
What's the success like, if we were rewriting this, I don't know. On the beach rolled out feature
flags and they saw 68% reduction in QA time because with feature flags like that, that's what I
mean. Like, where is the success with the customer? I agree, something we can take back.
01:09:20:18 - 01:09:47:10
Jens
For example, one thing we saw with schema checks, is one customer was able to schema
checks to reduce QA time by 30% because, previously they had, contract testing for Rest APIs
with schema checks. They could remove that. And now they, faster and more resource efficient
in shipping and shipping the graph and, the APIs.
01:09:47:10 - 01:09:48:18
Jens
So that's really good.
01:09:48:20 - 01:10:07:07
Stefan
I like it. One other thing is, I'm going to jump real quick and come back, but this needs to be on
the landing page. PlanetScale had it. Boom boom boom boom. Small little improvement here.
Tiny little spike and boom. Yes. Fantastic. We need that on the landing page.
01:10:07:07 - 01:10:08:25
Jens
Yes, yes..
01:10:08:27 - 01:10:30:17
Stefan
That's a huge, powerful feature. And the story behind it needs to be there. But yeah, this this
right here, by the way, is kind of an oxymoron. Gain valuable insights into your GraphQL API.
But then we don't show any of the insights. We just say it like, show me the dashboard, show
me the advance request tracing. Show me the valuable insights that I'm going to get through
your product.
01:10:30:17 - 01:10:41:00
Stefan
You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. Jens don't don't don't be too upset that we're roasting the
landing page. I know you put a lot of work into this, but the only way. Oh, I'm.
01:10:41:00 - 01:10:46:10
Jens
I'm not said it's you're you're absolutely right.
01:10:46:12 - 01:11:04:25
Stefan
Yeah, but what's good is we do this live and then we can actually take it back. So you guys are
going to see the improvements. This by the way I do like okay. So here we have some numbers.
But I think it's the wrong numbers. We're comparing against the Apollo router when actually we
should be talking about the P99 latency that our customers experience.
01:11:04:28 - 01:11:12:15
Stefan
What do you think. Oh also one other point. You're right. Cache warmer is tiny. It's at the very
bottom.
01:11:12:18 - 01:11:39:29
Jens
Yeah. Cache the cache warmer graph needs to be front and center. I think performance in a
router is important. Can we show differently? Yes. Is it the wrong number? Yeah. We could
actually show how it improves the customer. Like just the graph. We just had like P99 query
planning performance with the cache warmer. This is this is the router.
01:11:39:29 - 01:11:40:19
Jens
Yeah.
01:11:40:21 - 01:11:47:22
Stefan
And if we want we can even go the route of like SoundCloud. They had I forgot how many
gateways of.
01:11:47:24 - 01:12:03:21
Jens
Yeah. They, they because it's so efficient they could now run less gateways. So that's another
statement. So first statement is p95 per planning time. Second statement is SoundCloud reduce
gateways because they are so efficient perfect.
01:12:03:23 - 01:12:14:02
Stefan
So we can improve that down here. Three little features one that we don't even officially you can
kind of support and definitely need to fix that.
01:12:14:02 - 01:12:24:27
Jens
TheEDF's why why is it so small? It's it's such a powerful thing with Kafka and NATs and
everything and, yeah, but EDFS should have its own landing page.
01:12:24:29 - 01:12:46:04
Stefan
Yes. And same thing here. Okay, show me the organization. Wide access control. Like, show
me the grouping that Wilson is working on and how granular you can get, like, role based
access control on the namespace level, on the subgraph level, on the federated graph level.
Roll out your super graph to 400 developers across your organization, which, by the way, is a
use case that we have.
01:12:46:04 - 01:12:49:00
Stefan
We need to show that. Yeah.
01:12:49:02 - 01:12:54:08
Jens
Overall, out of ten points, how many points do you give this landing page.
01:12:54:10 - 01:13:12:04
Stefan
For what it was doing when we needed to do what it needed to be done? I give it like a five. It
did a great job. It really did. But I think now we definitely need to improve. Also is it just me. But
does the does the bar lag? Do you see the bar? It just like pauses your your computer.
01:13:12:04 - 01:13:12:20
Jens
It's not fast.
01:13:12:20 - 01:13:30:18
Stefan
Enough. Yeah it's viable okay okay cool. So guys we did run a little bit over. Yes. That was
actually super fun. I think for everyone that stuck around. Thank you guys so much. If you want
to, feel free to send us some more landing pages, send us your own. We can review those, too.
We're not biased.
01:13:30:18 - 01:13:43:21
Stefan
Obviously. We're going to give ours, you know, the full review that it got, if you saw we were
ripping into it. But yeah. Before we conclude, what was your idea ten score for the
WunderGraph landing page.
01:13:43:24 - 01:13:47:16
Jens
Maybe four.
01:13:47:18 - 01:13:57:17
Jens
You know, I think for a certain audience, it works. It definitely worked up until the series A.
01:13:57:19 - 01:14:09:03
Stefan
Okay, cool. So we're definitely going to be improving this, guys. So we might have a special
guest next week. If we do, the episode will be recorded, but the good thing is.
01:14:09:05 - 01:14:10:24
Jens
We're back next week.
01:14:10:26 - 01:14:19:11
Stefan
Yeah. Awesome. Thanks, guys. Happy Friday. Oh, I almost press leave studio instead of
endstream. Oh, what if everybody just keeps recording?
