Stefan
And we're live. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing.
I'm joined by always my co-host Jens. And today we have a very special guest. Viola, viola,
welcome to the podcast.
00:00:34:03 - 00:00:35:14
Viola
Thanks for having me.
00:00:35:16 - 00:00:56:07
Stefan
Of course, for those of you that don't know, viola, you're probably not one of our customers. But
for one of you that do. Viola is our amazing customer success manager. Today we're doing
something a little bit different. We're talking about how customer success is actually part of the
product. And so we thought we'd bring viola on and talk a little bit about how we do customer
success over here at Wunder Graph.
00:00:56:10 - 00:01:10:00
Stefan
And just for some context, so viola joined us in 2015. She's currently our only customer success
manager, and she's spearheading 2015. Oh my God, you're right. 2025. Sorry. That was a
Freudian slip by somebody yet.
00:01:10:03 - 00:01:10:12
Jens
Somebody is not yet 10 years old
00:01:10:12 - 00:01:31:07
Stefan
Yeah, so feels like it. I've been around here for so long that I'm just like, oh, my God. So viola
joined us very recently, 2025 as our first CSM hire. She has a background in solutions
engineering and UX research. She was previously at patch. And funny enough, Tyk, for those of
you that know the history of Tyk and Jens is also from Tyk and Jens, worked together with viola
at Tyk.
00:01:31:07 - 00:01:35:13
Stefan
He recommended her so viola that I missed anything on that introduction.
00:01:35:15 - 00:01:44:05
Viola
No, that was great. And yeah, it's been, a few months, but it's been a few intense months, so
yeah, they feel a little bit longer than that.
00:01:44:06 - 00:02:03:10
Stefan
And, and it's, it's actually my high school graduation year, so thank you. The other day I was
watching, like, on TikTok and, somebody made like an old video of, like, high school back in
2015. And they made it look like it was from the 90s. And I was like, Holy shit, am I that old
now? But yeah, I guess it's my ten year reunion in high school.
00:02:03:17 - 00:02:09:04
Jens
David, what makes you think that Stefan is already ten years old?
00:02:09:07 - 00:02:25:21
Stefan
I don't know. That was a good one. I go with David. All right. So cool. Viola, today we're going to
be talking about how we do customer success. One of the things that I'm excited about is
basically kind of the rotation that you've set up, the process that we used to have before and just
your background on that.
00:02:25:24 - 00:02:42:26
Stefan
So to kind of kick things off, one of the questions that I have is how do we currently do Customer
success at wynder Graph, and I want you to kind of explain it for the audience, and then we can
kind of go deeper into it. But as soon as we sign a contract, what do we kind of kick off for our
customers?
00:02:42:28 - 00:02:45:24
Jens
Oh, can I, can I interject because.
00:02:45:27 - 00:02:46:29
Stefan
We go.
00:02:47:01 - 00:02:53:04
Jens
Well, what I would find interesting is so, viola, how long are you with us now?
00:02:53:06 - 00:02:54:21
Viola
I think almost six months. Yeah.
00:02:54:26 - 00:03:12:16
Jens
Six months. Yeah. I would love to hear a little bit. And you can be honest. It's fine. We we we
can, we can live with that. But, you know, before you work with us, we, we kind of did everything
ourselves. And then maybe you can explain a little bit the journey. What did you find when you
joined us?
00:03:12:16 - 00:03:29:25
Jens
And how did you make that whole thing successful and scalable to, to where we are now?
Because I, I would love to hear a little bit the, the story like, well, what did you think in, in like the
first one two weeks and how did you professionalize that.
00:03:29:28 - 00:03:31:13
Stefan
And be honest.
00:03:31:15 - 00:03:59:21
Viola
Always. Yeah. So when I, when I joined, wundergraph, I think I found a team that's, you know,
super passionate. The engineering culture is permeates the company. And so a lot of the
support, a lot of the customer interactions are and some of them still are engineering lead. So
that meant that people that worked on product, would also answer customer queries.
00:03:59:21 - 00:04:31:17
Viola
And it would be an extremely efficient, process for the customers because quite literally, the
people that would build the code were the ones answering any queries, any feature requests,
any bugs. So, you know, that was incredible to see that at such scale. We are we're delivering a
great experience for the customers whilst also innovating. And that is a little bit the beauty and
the pain of start ups when you kind of have to figure things out as you go along.
00:04:31:19 - 00:05:09:05
Viola
You do a lot of things, you know, on your plate and you try to still support customers in a way
that, you would want to be supported because, again, we are delivering software that is utilized
by engineering, like yourselves. But had that had some, drawbacks, which meant that
engineering, engineering that was building product also had to sort of be part of this, support
rotation, which meant, of course they, alternating weeks where they would be on customer calls.
00:05:09:08 - 00:05:30:00
Viola
But it also indicated a lot of context switch. So, you know, having to jump on customer queries,
that would come in and having to always check, this customer channels to see if something new
is popping on. Figuring things out within your rota is also a big, you know, commitment and can
be a stressor for an engineer.
00:05:30:00 - 00:06:05:24
Viola
That's trying to also advance this product work. And so I think we figured out very, you know,
very efficiently that moving forward in this pattern might not be sustainable. It's the growth that
we have experienced. And, the context switch eventually becomes a bit untenable because you
either have to be extremely organized and figure things out very quickly, during your rotation, or
you kind of have to jump back and forth after your rotation to support the next engineer on call,
which can create a bit of a, you know, inefficient pattern.
00:06:05:26 - 00:06:35:21
Viola
And, in the worst case scenario could also mean that, you know, information is repeated, but
also information is missed. In the end overs. So yeah, I saw that, and at the same time, I think I
saw a great opportunity for us to carve out a little bit of that, support function to dedicate
resources that we could absolutely give and, focus on the customer, and eventually rotate out,
periodically.
00:06:35:28 - 00:06:45:22
Viola
But some are more, and it's something I was more sustainable, I think, for, for us as, where we
are as a company does that resonate with you guys?
00:06:45:25 - 00:07:08:01
Stefan
I think it was too nice. If I'm honest, it's interesting. Like, Jens if we look back before viola, like,
we went from, like, one customer to 2 to 3 and then to double digits, and now it's just kind of all
over the place. But we always wanted to keep engineering close. And I think that comes from
experience.
00:07:08:01 - 00:07:24:00
Stefan
Right? Jens from working with other people's products. And they had like customer support that
make a ticket and they would just throw it. Also, we had a really bad experience with one of our
infrastructure providers where we were like, how can we be on the highest tier of support? And
this is the support you get. What do you think Jens?
00:07:24:00 - 00:07:31:13
Jens
And are we mentioning that it was fly IO, the worst infra provider of the world, or would be?
00:07:31:15 - 00:07:50:15
Stefan
I was trying to be positive, but yeah, it was fly we were on the highest tier of support. They
basically didn't care about us, like at all. Like like no email support, no nothing. And then you
would hop on a call with them. Somebody would come who wasn't technical, they would jot
down notes, and then you would never hear from them again.
00:07:50:17 - 00:08:14:06
Jens
And so but you know, I remember two things from fly and it just it should just make you think
about what, what what what you can do in customer relationships. The first thing I remember
from fly is, that's every couple of days something broke and it didn't work, and we couldn't figure
out why. And the second thing is we had this.
00:08:14:09 - 00:08:25:29
Jens
There was a meeting with a lady who came in, and she asked us a question. She asked if we
removed one feature.
00:08:26:01 - 00:08:59:08
Jens
And, that would break your business. Which one would it be? And that's the two things I
remember. So I don't know, like I said this on I think on Twitter or LinkedIn the other day, if you if
you are a founder or customer success, maybe consider talking directly with your customers,
especially when they are founders, like, you know, founders know how founders think.
00:08:59:08 - 00:09:22:08
Jens
They know the dilemma. They know the problems they are in. Why don't you talk to them like
and one one thing I love about our culture, and this is something Viola keeps. Keeps, I would
say holding, holding the torch. At this time, I cannot join all the meetings anymore. Just it's it's
like too many.
00:09:22:08 - 00:10:04:22
Jens
And I also have other priorities, but we keep catching up with all our enterprise customers. We
we have, like, real meetings, and we even try to meet them in person at some time. Like, it's a
remote culture. We cannot do it so often. But, I think we have we have kind of, yeah, we are in a
place where we, where we, are able to scale and we, I would say the, the framework that Viola
has built it it works and it we, we can keep scaling that with, with customers and I mean from a
product side of you Cosmo, it is not a super simple product.
00:10:04:27 - 00:10:29:06
Jens
And everybody does federation a little bit different. And everybody wants to customize their
router in a different way or different, rate Limiting different. Like everybody has custom
authentication. It's super weird because like most people they have like multiple methods of
authentication. Legacy a new and you need to migrate. And so everybody needs to do some
custom stuff and you have questions.
00:10:29:08 - 00:10:58:06
Jens
And if you just run into viola and she will say, oh, I don't know. But maybe look into the docs.
And next week we will answer via email. That's just not going to cut it. And yeah, I, I like how we
do it. It's still pretty close. Of course we we're scaling a bit. We have a lot of customers now, but,
yeah, also we, we keep expanding the, the scope.
00:10:58:08 - 00:11:05:09
Jens
you hate about it?
Question for Viola what do you what do you love the most about customer success and what do
00:11:05:12 - 00:11:06:15
Stefan
Oh, that's a good one.
00:11:06:18 - 00:11:33:07
Viola
That's a great question. I would say the thing that I love the most is where when a customer
notifies us, that they, they're live, they're serving traffic, and we are part of that success. So I
think that's a great, awesome moment where we are realizing their goals. We're helping them
realize their goals and getting to that moment.
00:11:33:07 - 00:12:01:16
Viola
I think it's a great win for both them, of course. And in us as an organization that we're part of a
working stack and that we made a difference, you know, in, in getting there, I think that's a great
feeling. And I, a feeling that I always think should be a bit of a companywide feeling, because
everyone is responsible of customer success in an organization no matter your department.
00:12:01:18 - 00:12:24:03
Viola
I think maybe customer success should be a little bit of an umbrella. For for everyone. Because,
yeah, we should all take pride in that. And, and I would say, yeah, that's my favorite moment.
The least favorite moment. I think, you know, it's probably having, you know, a conversation
where you, you have to be managing expectations for the customer.
00:12:24:05 - 00:12:46:08
Viola
I think that becomes a bit of a, you know, you have to figure out how to best manage that
conflict that might arise, because customers really want a feature. They really want to get
something done. And it goes against everything, you know, empathic feeling to be able, you
know, to have to say no, right now, we can't deliver that feature.
00:12:46:08 - 00:13:16:06
Viola
We can't fix this or, you know, we don't have enough priority for this request. And really, you
know, it took me some years, to be able to be comfortable with that feeling. And I think the key
there was to realize that that, no, not now is a favor to the customer as well, because it means
that we are not able to focus on that particular request right now because we have competing
ones that will help make.
00:13:16:06 - 00:13:43:00
Viola
wundergraph even more successful. And in the grand scheme of things, selecting the most, you
know, high priority items eventually will make a cascading effect on the customer itself. So yes,
looking at it through that lens, I think makes it. Yeah. A lot more, more doable. But yeah, conflict,
you know, managing the conversations can can be a little bit of a hairy thing to do.
00:13:43:03 - 00:13:44:16
Stefan
Yeah, I would say.
00:13:44:16 - 00:14:09:03
Jens
So. You know what one of my learnings is, the customer has a job to be done. They say I want a
feature. We know it's not a good idea. And, if you have anxiety, you would just build it. But that's
not the good thing for them. It's not the good thing for us because we keep adding technical
depth.
00:14:09:06 - 00:14:38:05
Jens
And what I realized is they don't always really want the feature. They want the solution. So
instead of just saying no or creating a slack thread and saying no, what works so much better is
build a relationship that is strong enough so that you can hop on a call and say, we cannot do it
right now, or we think we will never do it because we don't believe it's the right thing.
00:14:38:05 - 00:15:04:28
Jens
But we give you an alternative path, and then they will be maybe a little bit upset because they
thought they can get this ASAP and maybe for free. And now they have to do some work. But if
we can explain to them why we don't believe this is the right way. Because if we don't do that, I
think we will just eventually stall the velocity of the company because we add so much scope,
you know?
00:15:04:29 - 00:15:30:01
Jens
Well, one thing I keep slowly seeing is like our focus is, is federation. We are not we are not API
management. We are not an API gateway. We are a federation gateway. And more and more
people come and they ask us to do API management things, and you should just have an API
gateway for that. And it can really.
00:15:30:03 - 00:15:39:22
Jens
Yeah. Result to, to scope creep and it's, it's sometimes it's really tough to say no. Right.
00:15:39:25 - 00:15:59:10
Viola
Yeah. But at the same time, you know what what you're highlighting is the communication. You
know, having that communication exist between you and the customer sometimes is enough to
to really make a difference in their, in our day to day because they're, you know, we have
experience of working with vendors that do not listen to your feedback.
00:15:59:10 - 00:16:28:18
Viola
They dont even give an avenue to be able to give either that feedback or request features, or
just really give a communication avenue to. And and I think with consumers becoming more and
more sophisticated, this is just going to become a non-negotiable. And it's a great differentiator
for us, and for any startup out there to kind of give that path for, for the contact with the
customer.
00:16:28:21 - 00:16:51:00
Viola
I think that's what customer success really enables to do. And if it wasn't called customer
success, but you still had that function, you know, you are still delivering that, you know, that
that connection with the customer and closing the loop. And it's a crazy, you know, crazy simple
activity that you can do. Well, it's highly effective.
00:16:51:03 - 00:17:08:15
Stefan
I would agree. Like, for me, like, sometimes I see, like, people are like, oh, like a founder doing,
like, customer success. And it's like, what else should I be doing? Like thank you. You are the
premise. And like in the early days, I didn't understand, like how some companies like fly or
whatever for me was like, what do you mean?
00:17:08:15 - 00:17:26:17
Stefan
Like, how would you not give support to your customers? Like, I understand you have a vision
and everything, but like we have it in our values that if our customers are successful, we will be
successful. So I don't understand why sometimes customer success, like with the company, is
like, it's not like the easiest thing you can do, but if you put effort to it, like you can always do it.
00:17:26:21 - 00:17:39:09
Stefan
And so I don't know, one of the questions that I have, though, how can poor support hurt a
business? Like where have you experienced poor support? And like, how does that differentiate
us and the ways that we give support?
00:17:39:11 - 00:18:04:23
Viola
That's a great question. I mean, for support, I think we we experienced this on a daily. I think
that it's where you become a oh, like, let's call it negative influencer. You know, when you start
talking about, some service or product that you're using there, you're obviously upset with and
you start, you know, not recommending to to friends and family and you start to really become a
detractor for that service.
00:18:04:28 - 00:18:32:20
Viola
And this happens more than we think. And the opposite as well. You have an extremely good
experience with something a service, a software. The tool you start becoming a bit of a micro
influencer in your own life to other people, to colleagues, to, you know, the word of mouth and
recommendations are such a huge, you know, network effect that it's critical to learn how to
make, make work.
00:18:32:22 - 00:18:53:06
Viola
And, I would say, you know, things I've experienced personally, you know, we've all used
software that was not, you know, fit for purpose. We've all experienced things that, you know,
you you wish there was a contact us button that would say, hey, let me just, provide a little bit of
support or ask about a bug i’m experiencing.
00:18:53:08 - 00:19:25:16
Viola
And there wouldn't be any, I you opportunity to do that? I've also experienced, you know, bots
when you're, you know, ask you for a question and you get like, clearly a bot response. And, I'm
actually an advocate for utilizing AI to increase your footprint of support, let's say, with
customers that are in intro tiers, that might not, you know, be able to, afford a specific support
tier and SLA, for example, and so on.
00:19:25:18 - 00:19:51:11
Viola
And being able to, to deliver something that is of high quality like, an AI agent that you've trained
properly and you've got the right, the right implementation with. But if it's done poorly, that can
hurt, business more than anything. And there's nothing worse than answering, you know, asking
something and receiving a completely poor, answer back or no need to speak to a human or all
those things.
00:19:51:11 - 00:20:14:24
Viola
And we have to remember we are serving humans. At the end of the day. And, we kind of lose
track of that, and we can't lose track of that empathic attitude that we need to have when, when,
when dealing with this. So yeah, it will be an interesting thing to to see. But for wundergraph, I
think we have such a close pulse.
00:20:14:26 - 00:20:39:29
Viola
On things we are extremely observant on the data that we currently have on customers. I think,
we recently enabled NPS scoring and within a few minutes of receiving, a score with a
comment, we immediately jumped on it and, you know, analyzed it dissected it, and, figure out
the path forward to get on a call to the with the customer to get even more, qualitative feedback.
00:20:40:01 - 00:21:08:07
Viola
So I think we are in a, in such a special moment of our journey. This is where you guys have
figured out a really hard start. You know, the pillar of the foundation of figuring this funding figure
on the revenue model, figuring out all these really huge questions. And now we are in this build
mode where we can actually focus on, you know, innovating and maintaining a close
communication with the customer, which is a great source for that product.
00:21:08:08 - 00:21:20:11
Viola
Drive. And at the same time learn more, because at the end of the day, we always have to
iterate on this is not, you know, this model today is not going to look like it in six months.
00:21:20:13 - 00:21:38:04
Stefan
Or one thing to add on NPS score. Can we talk a little bit about how you sent it to four
wundergraph employees and what Jesse responded? I've been laughing about that for two days
now. That was such a funny reply. If you want to give the viewers context of basically what
happened.
00:21:38:06 - 00:22:01:08
Viola
Yeah. So, we enabled NPS scoring. So like, an automatic pop up, if you will, over slack
channels that, we, we share with, customers. So these are individual, slack channels that each
customer has got enabled with us. And we, we just wanted to grab a very quick NPS score
without being too disruptive, without sending emails and so on.
00:22:01:10 - 00:22:28:27
Viola
So that was a great set up. But for some reason, the tool that we utilized, counted about 4 or 5
employees as the customer, cohort. And so one of our engineers, received this is NPS survey,
which included just one question. And, it gave us great insight as to what an engineer would
typically answer on an NPS score that's disrupting their day, which is like, please do not contact
me again.
00:22:28:27 - 00:22:57:29
Viola
Don't ask me any more questions. Which, you know, it's crazy, but we we see this every day.
You know, we have these personas that are caring about different things or caring about, you
know, aspects of their work that a decision maker might not care about. They might want to
focus more on the business use cases, or you know, they might appreciate more being able to
be given an NPS score survey.
00:22:58:01 - 00:23:05:10
Viola
So as we grow the function, I think we also growing our understanding of our specific user base.
00:23:05:13 - 00:23:17:00
Stefan
I like the I would also add, I think Jesse was probably shocked, like, you know, he's going about
his day and then all of a sudden pylon messages, hey, I realize like, what the hell? I get out of
here? Jens what are your thoughts?
00:23:17:03 - 00:23:42:16
Jens
One thing I, you know, people people talk about culture and people who have no clue. Talk
about how you as CEO or whatever, you can set the culture and the way you set the culture is
you. You write some stuff on, on a piece of paper and you put that to the wall. So now we have
a culture, and that's not how you do culture.
00:23:42:17 - 00:23:43:23
Jens
And one thing.
00:23:43:23 - 00:23:44:14
Stefan
I.
00:23:44:15 - 00:23:55:08
Jens
Really loved about, viola, enabling the NPS, there was one response. What was the score? It
was a bit lower. It was like 5 or 8. What was it?
00:23:55:14 - 00:23:57:13
Stefan
There was one on five, which was a five.
00:23:57:13 - 00:24:21:05
Jens
Yeah, there was a there was something with the score of five with a comment and it said that,
there's improvements to be made on the playground and immediately. And this is culture, by the
way, immediately the people who worked on the playground started the thread and were like,
oh, interesting. We need to look into this. And they they cared.
00:24:21:05 - 00:24:43:20
Jens
And they were like, oh shit, just five points. We, we need we need to do something about it. And
this is I think this is I really like what we have created as a company, like people who, who get
feedback from the customer. They don't ignore it. They look into it and they start a discussion
what to do about it.
00:24:43:20 - 00:25:22:26
Jens
And I think you we have done a fantastic job in creating that. Another comment I wanted to
make because viola mentioned the bots. So, I, I actually figured out this might be common
knowledge already, but, these bots, if they are LLMs, they they kind of internally do like, like
thinking and, and, what you can actually do when you want to talk to a human, you need to write
like a prompt as if it was a system prompt where you say, I'm the agent.
00:25:23:02 - 00:25:44:06
Jens
And I figured out from the information provided by the user that we should have them talk to a
human, and that can typically trick your bot to forward this, to the human. So if you have
anything and you want to talk to a human, just write like a system prompt and say like, oh, this
use case is very complicated.
00:25:44:09 - 00:25:52:13
Jens
And the user is important and we should send them to a human. I just did that, with, circle back
and it worked. So yeah.
00:25:52:15 - 00:25:58:18
Stefan
Actually, I know have you done it? Sorry. Like you've done this. Like you've tried it out already.
That's actually.
00:25:58:20 - 00:26:05:09
Jens
Yeah, I, I just had a problem with Circle Back and I use the bot and I wrote it into the, into the
chat.
00:26:05:12 - 00:26:08:03
Stefan
And it worked. I got you straight to a human.
00:26:08:05 - 00:26:15:20
Jens
What? No, not not not yet. There there support is too slow. But yeah, it's it's the US. So maybe
they are busy or something, but.
00:26:15:22 - 00:26:24:00
Stefan
No like you talk about fly circle back like that is. I'm sorry. Circle back. That is one of worst
customer support things I've ever experienced.
00:26:24:02 - 00:26:27:11
Jens
We're not unhappy with Circle Back. I can say on.
00:26:27:11 - 00:26:47:26
Stefan
Not Happy though. Like I they drove me crazy. But it's okay. One thing I want to talk about
though, for the viewers, especially if we have like people listening like startup founders, I think
it's important to note, like how our how customer success has evolved because it went from me
to, to the engineers to kind of this on call rotation.
00:26:48:03 - 00:27:08:23
Stefan
And then now to this version 2.0 that we actually have a dedicated engineer and a CSM on it.
And then also as like you said, Viola it's evolving, it's definitely not going to be what it is today.
But I guess we can start a little bit with the history. So yeah. And if you remember, at what point
do we really like know like one customer was manageable, then two, then three.
00:27:08:23 - 00:27:29:16
Stefan
And then we got to like ten and then 15. And then at that point I think around like 25 or 30, we
introduced what we call an on call engineer and basically from the beginning, engineers have
always been involved with support. All of our engineers were in every single slack. And there
were tiers. We had support tiers based on what plan that they were on.
00:27:29:16 - 00:27:48:19
Stefan
So for example, enterprise. But Jens, if you remember, I think this is also a culture thing. We
said we want to provide the best support possible. So try to respond to every customer within an
hour. And if you remember, the team was very good at that. Our score of average response time
when we were in Alta David was responding within two minutes.
00:27:48:19 - 00:28:11:12
Stefan
And this is, by the way, yeah, while he's developing. So David had this crazy record. Is that like
a customer would post a question within two minutes? David responds. And if you looked at the
other team, Nithin and Suvij each, and Dave who was with us and everybody, they were
responding within minutes. And so it got to a point though, where it started to hurt us because
we were so good at support, but the engineering started slowing down.
00:28:11:12 - 00:28:33:28
Stefan
So we were like, okay guys, we need to think of an approach like we're getting too big. We can't
be just providing support. So let's come up with this. What I called, this was Breton meeting
number one, which was on call engineer. We have some engineers in the US. We have some
engineers in Europe. What we'll do is each week we'll have one engineer in Europe on call and
one engineer in America on call.
00:28:34:00 - 00:28:54:24
Stefan
Europe covers a European time zone up until the American engineer wakes up. And then then
American engineer takes point. And basically he's the person that's supposed to take and
answer the questions while all the other engineers are focusing on their tasks. And what would
happen is he would address them. He would help them out. If you didn't understand something,
then he could rope in another engineer and so it was designed to kind of like delegate that
process.
00:28:54:27 - 00:29:13:29
Stefan
It was an improvement. But we brought on viola then, and, the first thing Viola did was let me
take a look at the metrics and, and viola, talk to us a little bit about that process. So we had our
call engineer and then we brought you in. We had a very interesting observation where you
presented us that case, and we were like, oh shit, okay, we need to make another change.
00:29:14:02 - 00:29:50:05
Viola
Yeah. So looking at the analytics from our internal, ticketing manager management, software,
we hooked up with slack and with our email support and so on. We could look at, how many
people touched tickets every week, so interacted with those commented in song, and it was
something like 15 people on average. And if you have a rotation, you know, if like 1 or 2
engineers a week, then you're looking at, you know, over a 13 people that should not, should
not have been necessarily involved on this ticket.
00:29:50:07 - 00:30:16:27
Viola
And it was because the weekly basis rotation was not enough to cover the completion of certain
tickets, because they were complex. They required, you know, additional scoping and, you
know, back and forth with the customers and so on. So the timelines were simply not enough in
that sense. But also there were some tickets that actually occurred over, weeks and months,
you know, back and forth of solutioning and so on.
00:30:16:29 - 00:30:48:04
Viola
So that context switch, which are we talked a little bit at the start of the of our meeting now is, is
were really was apparent to many people on support all the time. I also believe that we were
looking at completion rate. We're looking at how many tickets versus actual bug reports and
feature requests were asked, and just started to make sense to have like a dedicated set of
resources on that particular queries for the customers.
