00:39:45:14 - 00:40:00:16
type: podcast-chunk
Jens
Free, mid-market. I think I would prefer if mid-market had a pricing and not just book a demo,
but okay, I guess the product is complex.
00:40:00:18 - 00:40:01:18
Stefan
00:40:01:21 - 00:40:02:06
Jens
So you have to.
00:40:02:10 - 00:40:06:03
Stefan
Explain it,
00:40:06:06 - 00:40:08:12
Jens
Book demo.
00:40:08:14 - 00:40:15:01
Stefan
I would move.
I think that they're doing the right things. Click on enterprise. I want to see their enterprise page.
00:40:15:03 - 00:40:17:22
Jens
SSO to enterprise.
00:40:17:24 - 00:40:21:12
Stefan
Oh, but that's external and single sign on.
00:40:21:15 - 00:40:22:19
Jens
Yeah. And here.
00:40:22:22 - 00:40:24:22
Stefan
Internal internal. So like for your org.
00:40:24:23 - 00:40:39:22
Jens
Just just make it make it enterprise. And one other thing I think mid-market should be able to
just sign up but okay. And self-service. But it's fine. Maybe you intentionally want to do this to
talk to people. What do you want to see? Enterprise.
00:40:39:25 - 00:40:45:01
Stefan
Well, actually, we got it. We got to hurry up a little bit. We have a bunch more to say. So let's
jump real quick to the criteria.
00:40:45:03 - 00:40:46:07
Jens
We started very late.
00:40:46:09 - 00:40:58:26
Stefan
We started ten minutes late, so we still got 30 minutes to go. Let me see the criteria okay.
00:40:58:28 - 00:41:11:03
Jens
Criteria. Are they solving a real meaningful problem? I say yeah
00:41:11:05 - 00:41:37:16
Jens
I agree differentiation are they unique. Are they already being outplayed? I don't know the
market in this segment so well, but from how it looks like to me it looks quite sophisticated and
like way beyond, like just a wrapper or something. So, I think they put a lot of thought into this,
so it could be, could be unique and green.
00:41:37:17 - 00:41:51:28
Stefan
What if you got. I'm the same. I think it's a lot of unique and love it to the product. They have a
lot of testimonials. I think that they are unique. I feel like it's going to work out, and I don't think
OpenAI will nuke it. I think it could build it if you want it to with all your stuff.
00:41:52:03 - 00:42:06:16
Jens
They will not nuke it. So switch to our tier board. So unicorn I don't know will survive can
survive. Good chance.
00:42:06:18 - 00:42:10:29
Stefan
Yeah I put it will survive I think they will survive.
00:42:11:02 - 00:42:12:12
Jens
They will survive.
00:42:12:14 - 00:42:19:04
Stefan
No I'm going to put a good chance. What do you think? There's a good chance they will survive.
00:42:19:06 - 00:42:34:09
Jens
If they have so much traction, they could pivot into more than just playbooks and stuff that they
could do much more in the in the sales. And AI thing so, yeah. Somewhere between A and B.
00:42:34:11 - 00:42:36:11
Stefan
Let's put it here, good chance for now.
00:42:36:13 - 00:42:36:22
Jens
Okay.
00:42:36:26 - 00:42:40:20
Stefan
But they're pretty decent. Well done guys.
00:42:40:22 - 00:42:43:21
Jens
We we had a question on the chat.
00:42:43:24 - 00:42:56:14
Stefan
Yeah. Do you guys think that the AI startup, which are actually just a < random API, ai API here
>, wrapper actually will survive the next two years? You want to answer that one?
00:42:56:16 - 00:43:14:17
Jens
I mean, if we look at the first couple startups, Thunder code, marblism and klavis and what we
said, I think it's pretty clear that, there's absolutely no chance these wrappers will get anywhere.
00:43:14:20 - 00:43:26:09
Stefan
Yeah. Agreed. Okay. Let's try slide ten. Oh, now here we go. Cursor for data teams dev tools
San Francisco get now.
00:43:26:09 - 00:43:38:28
Jens
if it is what I think it is I think it's really cool. But I also see a danger. Let's see.
00:43:39:00 - 00:43:47:09
Jens
Hello, data. Vibing. AI code editor to ship data at business pace.
00:43:47:12 - 00:44:00:01
Stefan
Wait, but that's horrible, because some businesses are super slow. Like, do you want to ship the
pace of your business? Like anyone that knows enterprises like it takes us six months to ship
one feature. You don't want that man.
00:44:00:03 - 00:44:05:18
Jens
Imagine what? Wait, I fix it. One Sec.
00:44:05:21 - 00:44:15:02
Stefan
Oh, God.
00:44:15:04 - 00:44:30:21
Stefan
Oh my God, oh my God. AI editor to ship data at SAP pace, you know, what that means is
they're going to put a deadline, they're going to get to the deadline, they're going to move the
deadline, and then before you know it, two years later, they havent ever built anything. Yeah.
00:44:30:23 - 00:44:34:09
Jens
Okay. So then.
00:44:34:12 - 00:44:34:24
Stefan
Hey.
00:44:34:26 - 00:44:48:29
Jens
AI code editor to ship data at business space. Yeah, I'm not sure. Let's see what this is. So this
zooms in here. I have this thing. Okay. not sre why its there.
00:44:49:01 - 00:44:58:17
Stefan
David brought up a good point. You remember last week we were talking to that bank guy, and
he was like, we ship six times a year.
00:44:58:19 - 00:45:10:23
Stefan
This could be good for data teams if they want to ship at that business pace. Oh my God. Yeah,
we ship twice a year. It's crazy. Jens I'm going to be completely honest to you, this looks like a
fork of vs code.
00:45:10:25 - 00:45:29:24
Jens
No it's. Yeah okay. That's a fork of vs code. But here's the thing. Hello data vibing AI code editor.
Then they show a code editor and here it okay. It has autocompletion.
00:45:29:27 - 00:45:30:25
Stefan
Okay.
00:45:30:27 - 00:45:39:01
Jens
And here is a chat. But why? Why is it so freakin tiny? Like I have to zoom in. Okay.
00:45:39:03 - 00:45:44:02
Stefan
Is this a YC company? I think it is. Yeah, it is so Its a YC company.
00:45:44:04 - 00:45:45:01
Jens
Okay.
00:45:45:03 - 00:45:45:18
Stefan
I don't know.
00:45:45:18 - 00:45:48:21
Jens
What they do. So far. It looks like, vs code.
00:45:48:22 - 00:45:51:24
Stefan
Then they have post hog in there though.
00:45:51:27 - 00:45:59:12
Jens
ship data faster. See now now they here they have an editor.
00:45:59:14 - 00:46:03:06
Stefan
I'm confused though. This is cursor.
00:46:03:09 - 00:46:07:22
Jens
No, no, it's nao.
00:46:07:24 - 00:46:12:09
Stefan
But it's cursor. Like, why can't you just use cursor to do what they're doing?
00:46:12:11 - 00:46:31:21
Jens
Yeah. And this is one thing I wanted to bring up so I can run with DBT and analytics and Python
pipelines. Okay. There's one important thing because cursor has support for a thing. It's called
notebooks. And I think it does more or less the same thing.
00:46:31:24 - 00:46:34:11
Stefan
I'm so confused by this, to be honest.
00:46:34:14 - 00:46:54:04
Jens
S says looks like it could be a VSCode plugin. Yeah, I agree, native data integration tab to data.
Okay, they they index your tables and then they help you with Autocompletion. That's okay.
Instant diff preview.
00:46:54:07 - 00:46:56:06
Stefan
SHIP data faster.
00:46:56:09 - 00:47:01:15
Jens
Agent for data quality checks.
00:47:01:17 - 00:47:03:05
Stefan
To run all this more.
00:47:03:05 - 00:47:12:19
Jens
I'm Not sure data diff. If you say agent for data diff what you mean is I guess.
00:47:12:21 - 00:47:14:01
Stefan
00:47:14:03 - 00:47:39:27
Jens
What you what you mean is you have a system problem that makes two calls and compares the
data and then prints it like this. So what agent to run your tests. Okay. I think they fell in love too
much with the agent thing. This is weird. Like, this is is my computer is broken. Maybe. Okay.
Data warehouse.
00:47:39:27 - 00:47:48:24
Jens
Whatever start data vibing, How is it different than cursor?
00:47:48:25 - 00:47:56:15
Stefan
There we go.
00:47:56:18 - 00:47:58:27
Stefan
cursor can do this.
00:47:58:29 - 00:48:05:11
Jens
I don't believe the cursor cannot do it.
00:48:05:13 - 00:48:10:29
Jens
Okay. pricing, pricing 30 bucks.
00:48:10:29 - 00:48:22:09
Stefan
. Yeah, it's the same price as cursor. I don't know dude. I think they're dead in the water. Like
this is an extremely.
00:48:22:12 - 00:48:27:20
Stefan
let's go to the tier list.
00:48:27:22 - 00:48:32:23
Jens
Okay.
00:48:32:25 - 00:48:35:12
Jens
are they solving a real meaningful problem.
00:48:35:14 - 00:48:46:26
Stefan
I don't think so. It looks like. Well, yeah, the problem's real, but cursor solve this problem. Like, I
didn't see any differentiator.
00:48:46:28 - 00:48:53:03
Stefan
Like, I feel like the problem is super specialized. Like. But why can't you just use cursor if you're
on a data team or if you're a data engineer.
00:48:53:03 - 00:49:08:09
Jens
Terms of differentiation, like I'm pretty sure that very soon we will see like JetBrains and
VSCode and you name them, they will all be able to talk to the database. So my gut feeling is
not so positive.
00:49:08:12 - 00:49:26:17
Stefan
The data vibing part made me laugh too like, I feel like that's the one thing you should not be
vibing with is like your data or your customer's data or like really should not be vibing with your
customers information. Oh God, that would terrify me. Okay, will, open AI, nuke it. I mean, they
just bought wind surf, so yeah.
00:49:26:20 - 00:49:51:02
Stefan
Okay, let's go to the list. Sorry guys. It's dead in the water. And by the way, none of this is meant
like, this is all just in good fun. Like, the fun thing about startups is, like, 99% of the time. You're
right. So any of these could possibly become a unicorn. This is just our fun opinion. So if you're
watching this from now or any of these, feel free to make a list of ours and roast us.
00:49:51:04 - 00:49:55:19
Jens
In a couple of years. You will laugh about how dumb we are.
00:49:55:22 - 00:49:58:08
Stefan
Imagine all of these become unicorns.
00:49:58:10 - 00:49:59:03
Jens
Yes.
00:49:59:05 - 00:50:25:00
Stefan
Okay, okay, so Amy is not, the, is not YC backed venture capital. Okay. Finance San Francisco.
Good start. The AI agent for private market investors. Okay. Oh, I actually saw this video. Hold
up. I actually think I know which company this is. This one is a beast. Actually, I've actually seen
this one. What's wrong with your website?
00:50:25:00 - 00:50:27:14
Stefan
Why is nothing loading.
00:50:27:17 - 00:50:30:27
Jens
It's loading. It's all there.
00:50:30:29 - 00:50:36:24
Stefan
Okay, I know that they raised a crap ton of money.
00:50:36:27 - 00:50:51:03
Stefan
Okay, so she does all of it. What she's doing is she's reaching out. She basically does what an
associate does for a VC firm.
00:50:51:06 - 00:51:02:10
Stefan
Scroll down. I'm going to lie to you. I don't know what they're doing about the landing page, but
because I watched the videos, I kind of do understand what they do.
00:51:02:12 - 00:51:20:00
Stefan
Yeah, they have a good video on LinkedIn. Go on their LinkedIn. They're basically associates,
VC firms right here to see watch list monitoring, deep due diligence, exit planning, portfolio data,
market mapping, team evaluations, meeting preparation, all the stuff that an associate would do
at a VC firm.
00:51:20:03 - 00:51:27:25
Jens
But why don't they say Amy does all the stuff that a sales associate does at a VC firm.
00:51:27:27 - 00:51:30:23
Stefan
Ah they're a startup. They're figuring it out.
00:51:30:26 - 00:51:33:08
Jens
Okay, what is this? Draft an email
00:51:33:10 - 00:51:50:25
Stefan
You know what that means. But do you know that meme or it's like the guy, like aiming the gun
and then the person, like, right behind him aiming the gun. It's like, VC partners investing in this
to kill their own associates. And it's like, you know what I mean? It's like, wait, why are we
investing into Amy?
00:51:50:28 - 00:51:55:23
Stefan
to get rid of you, man. Of course.
00:51:55:25 - 00:51:58:18
Jens
Imagine you're an associate.
00:51:58:21 - 00:52:04:09
Stefan
And you're researching amy, and you find Amy, you're like, yeah, not going to bring this up.
00:52:04:09 - 00:52:10:27
Jens
So I think this this company is unfundable because every every associate will pass it.
00:52:11:00 - 00:52:14:28
Stefan
Nope. Not my shit. Okay. This one's actually good.
00:52:14:28 - 00:52:21:14
Jens
I didn't like it, so I'm not sure what is going on here.
00:52:21:17 - 00:52:26:20
Stefan
You know, if something is supposed to be happening here?
00:52:26:22 - 00:52:29:02
Stefan
Here's a competitive.
00:52:29:04 - 00:52:30:19
Jens
Churn rate list.
00:52:30:21 - 00:52:34:17
Stefan
Okay? I think their landing page is horrible. Go to their LinkedIn. No, I do want to see their I.
00:52:34:17 - 00:52:46:15
Jens
Think I honestly, I think this is one of the worst landing pages I've ever seen. So I don't
understand one tiny bit what this does.
00:52:46:17 - 00:52:56:23
Jens
Like, and I don't know why. Why is 97% of the screen black and then, you know, my my eyes
have to go here and then here and.
00:52:56:25 - 00:52:59:18
Stefan
00:52:59:21 - 00:53:01:20
Jens
Cool. Okay. Where should I go?
00:53:01:23 - 00:53:13:27
Stefan
LinkedIn. Go to their Linkedin because I know they have a cool I want to see it. So, go to posts.
00:53:13:29 - 00:53:23:26
Stefan
And close your messages to the Right. It's just a bunch of people spamming you. Scroll down.
00:53:23:29 - 00:53:31:21
Stefan
Okay, here's the video.
00:53:31:24 - 00:53:42:17
Stefan
Yeah, this is the video that I saw.
00:53:42:20 - 00:53:56:16
Stefan
I actually think I sent this to Jacob, though, but it's literally replacing associates.
00:53:56:19 - 00:54:05:24
Stefan
I think it's a good startup. I think they need to work on their landing page, though.
00:54:05:27 - 00:54:11:27
Stefan
I like the name too they like humanized her.
00:54:12:00 - 00:54:32:27
Jens
No, I don't like it. I. From. All interactions I had with VCs. Is that the VC process is this slow? It's
personal. It's due diligence. It's not. Some like you don't do it with with AI.
00:54:33:00 - 00:54:34:22
Stefan
AI.
00:54:34:24 - 00:54:40:19
Jens
Anyways. Impact. Are they solving a real meaningful problem?
00:54:40:22 - 00:54:45:09
Stefan
Are AI are associates doing a bad job?
00:54:45:11 - 00:55:04:24
Jens
So, um I don't know what. Maybe that solves a problem for VCs. I'm not a VC, I cannot speak
for it. Maybe it could look like they. They have a point, but maybe they don't. I I'm not sure. Do
you think it's a real problem?
00:55:04:26 - 00:55:13:15
Stefan
space.
I don't know, okay. Like associates, like, I feel like. I don't know, I don't know, I'm not in the VC
00:55:13:15 - 00:55:16:24
Jens
Okay. Differentiation.
00:55:16:26 - 00:55:39:11
Stefan
I haven't seen a company like this. I think they differentiated on having the worst landing page
possible so that that was very unique. Right? I don't know I don't know about this one, to be
honest. I'm. I'm on the fence, like, do you feel like it's going to work out. It could if if the problem
is legit, could API nuke it or open API?
00:55:39:13 - 00:55:42:04
Jens
Open AI will not nuke it.
00:55:42:06 - 00:55:51:21
Stefan
Yeah okay, let's get rid of the tier list. So it was Amy. I'd put them in coin flip I don't know.
00:55:51:23 - 00:55:54:10
Jens
Yeah, coinflip is fine.
00:55:54:12 - 00:56:04:19
Stefan
I have no idea what happened with them. All right. I think we have three more. Please give us a
good one. We haven't had one unicorn yet.
00:56:04:22 - 00:56:06:28
Jens
Okay, the last three.
00:56:07:00 - 00:56:16:28
Stefan
Ciroos, Your AI SRE Teammate. DevOps and infrastructure Pleasanton. Where is that, is that in
like South Carolina.
00:56:17:01 - 00:56:18:29
Jens
Dustin will love it.
00:56:19:01 - 00:56:35:13
Stefan
Pleasanton. Can somebody look up where Pleasanton is. Dustin so far might hate this. She
raised 21 million in seed funding. Holy shit 21.
00:56:35:13 - 00:56:36:26
Jens
One seed.
00:56:36:28 - 00:57:03:23
Stefan
What’s the evaluation Thereyre definitely over 100 200 million. Can you click on the funding
announcement? Okay. By High Energy Impact Founders okay. Scroll down. This is why. So. Go
to the About Us I want to see who the founders are. These are definitely some people like that
have been in this space for a while.
00:57:03:26 - 00:57:15:24
Stefan
Wow. February 2025 by 123 okay three founder team. They were working at AWS. Go to the
about us. I want to see who the founders are.
00:57:15:27 - 00:57:16:29
Jens
About us. Where is it.
00:57:16:29 - 00:57:21:09
Stefan
It? Yeah, it's in the navbar.
00:57:21:11 - 00:57:48:00
Stefan
Here. Yeah. Okay. scroll down. Our values are. Here we go. Yeah. Okay. So he built businesses
from 0 to 5 million for startup. He was a EXVP and GV at Cisco EXVP at Cisco EX VP of
products at Cisco AWS. Product runs marathon. Yeah, I mean, this is a stacked founder team.
Like they have a the experience doesn't mean that they'll do successful.
00:57:48:00 - 00:58:10:29
Stefan
But they obviously who are the angel investors. That'll tell us something to. Runs marathons for
fun. Nobody runs a marathon for fun. Why would Somebody do that and. Okay, so that's their
partner. Did they not have any angels in there.
00:58:11:02 - 00:58:15:28
Jens
They didn't show them. Let's try to figure out what they do okay.
00:58:16:00 - 00:58:30:16
Stefan
Become an SRE superhero. Reduce store investigate incident fast and drive autonomous
operations okay. So they're clearly building straight for the enterprises. By the way.
00:58:30:19 - 00:58:47:03
Jens
So one thing I, I understand, investigate incidents faster. Drive autonomous operations. I don't
know what this means and what the impact this can you can you translate to me reduce toil?
00:58:47:05 - 00:58:49:28
Stefan
I have no idea what toil is.
00:58:50:01 - 00:58:55:05
Jens
Okay, I thought I'm the. I'm the non-native speaker.
00:58:55:07 - 00:58:57:24
Stefan
Does anyone know what toil is? Yeah. David. What's toil?
00:58:57:25 - 00:59:02:06
Jens
Jacob? Jacob, what is toil?
00:59:02:08 - 00:59:27:10
Stefan
Oh, here is automate. Reduce SRE toil with out of the box enterprise. does it mean something
with integrations? tOil is working with stefan. probably to toil means to grind. I guess to work
hard. So reduce SRE hard work and grinding with out of the box enterprise integrations.
00:59:27:12 - 00:59:37:08
Jens
Okay. Feeling burnout from constant firefighting. You know what this reminds me of? If I go to
these guys so they all came from.
00:59:37:10 - 00:59:37:22
Stefan
Cisco.
00:59:37:28 - 00:59:42:12
Jens
Cisco Appdynamics must have been a really bad place to work.
00:59:42:12 - 00:59:45:23
Stefan
That's.
00:59:45:26 - 00:59:59:20
Jens
Imagine you work at a company, and you're so upset with SRE and whatever, and and the
maintenance of the of the platform that you create the startup that's hilarious.
00:59:59:22 - 01:00:12:08
Jens
Okay. Problem. It's pretty fast to actually check it. Okay. Yeah. I'm not an SRE. We need to ask,
Dustin our CTO if that's a real problem.
01:00:12:10 - 01:00:26:03
Stefan
Jacob, can you bring up David's last comment? Because it's what you said about Cisco
Appdynamics is to work hard, typically miserably. I guess they experience a lot toil at Cisco.
Technically, that's actually funny.
01:00:26:04 - 01:00:38:21
Jens
So. So I'm very honest with you. I absolutely don't understand what they do. Like something
with SRE, something investigates incidents faster, but I don't get it.
01:00:38:21 - 01:00:56:27
Stefan
It's how is this different from incident io like how is this is a specialized with SREs? You know
what, I'm going to be completely honest. I think that they've just been in the space for very long,
and they were able to raise a seed round, a massive seed round just based on their like,
experience and their resumes
01:00:56:28 - 01:00:58:06
Stefan
I don’t know what they solve.
01:00:58:06 - 01:00:59:09
Jens
Know, what it looks like to.
01:00:59:09 - 01:01:00:26
Stefan
Me.
01:01:00:28 - 01:01:30:19
Jens
Because so I saw the announcement and here if you if you skim it, you see this built on the
recently announced model context protocol MCP and agent to agent. So to me, what it looks
like is they have connectors to all these SRE tools Grafana, Prometheus, whatever. And they
build an agent that talks to all these things with APIs.
01:01:30:19 - 01:01:43:15
Jens
And then it does something. But yeah, I don't know. It sounds like something that, that Datadog
would do or Grafana would do or. Yeah, look.
01:01:43:15 - 01:01:54:07
Stefan
At this stuff from Diego 21 million at seed for founders with a good resume. Plus AI we are so
back. I think we're about to enter into a zerp era because I don't know what this does.
01:01:54:10 - 01:02:00:21
Jens
Stefan tell me for 21 million. What are they doing?
01:02:00:23 - 01:02:10:23
Stefan
They're making everybody a superhero in SRE. Okay, okay. Head back to the tier list.
01:02:10:25 - 01:02:18:04
Jens
Let's check here. Impact. Are they solving a real meaningful problem? So I.
01:02:18:04 - 01:02:22:01
Stefan
Think SRE is.
01:02:22:04 - 01:02:39:17
Jens
A real thing. It's a problem. It's. It's important to do it. And it's very meaningful. Are they solving
it? I am not sure what they do, but we have a bunch of statements from the chat. Maybe you
can bring it up. So what do we have?
01:02:39:19 - 01:02:56:16
Stefan
Me and Jacob keep clicking on it at the same time. Sorry, Jacob. Okay, I guess they leverage AI
to root cause incidents something that would take a typical on call engineer a few hours, why
don't they put this on the landing page? If that's what they do, I understand exactly what they
do. And I would pay money for this.
01:02:56:19 - 01:03:13:14
Jens
Yes, you know, the hero could be investigate incidents in minutes instead of hours by
connecting your 100 tools to AI, blah blah blah.
01:03:13:16 - 01:03:24:07
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. Well done. Well said. Okay, if that was the landing page, I would say, yeah, they are
solving a real meaningful problem are they unique. Are they being outplayed?
01:03:24:10 - 01:03:48:15
Jens
So I don't see this being unique because if I was working at Datadog or Grafana, this this would
be the very first thing I would try to do, to be honest. Yeah. So and then I have if I'm Grafana, I
have more market distribution than, than you. So, my gut feeling is, their go to market will be
extremely hard.
01:03:48:18 - 01:04:11:02
Jens
To be honest. I think solving the tech, like connecting all these APIs and then putting LLM into
the middle and like, I think solving the technical problem, I think it's it's doable. And they seem to
have the credentials that, that indicate they can do it. Can they, can they really scale it in terms
of business side? We will see.
01:04:11:04 - 01:04:25:09
Stefan
And they have 21 million. So all right let's go to a tier list. That was just curious. I'd put coin to be
honest I would put rest in piece I don't know, a 21 million. Yeah.
01:04:25:09 - 01:04:27:13
Jens
They have So much funding maybe.
01:04:27:15 - 01:04:29:24
Stefan
Let's put coin flip. Let's put coin flip.
01:04:29:26 - 01:04:35:25
Jens
But but you know why. Why I would have a tendency and say they say they will fail.
01:04:35:27 - 01:04:38:00
Stefan
Too Much money.
01:04:38:03 - 01:05:02:29
Jens
Two things. First, they have a lot of money. So that means they will move rather quickly and
they will burn super fast. And they have to burn fast because expectations are high. Second,
they are all not in their 20s. They are very experienced guys. So, I don't think they are hungry
enough. I think they all have earned the money.
01:05:03:01 - 01:05:16:27
Jens
They worked at Cisco. They they don't need money. So I don't think, like, if this will not
immediately work out, I think they will just abandon it because they can they can go back to a
safe job and,
01:05:16:29 - 01:05:23:04
Stefan
Yeah,but they raised 21 million. They definitely probably took on secondaries. It's a seed round.
01:05:23:06 - 01:05:28:07
Jens
Okay. We will see the second last one.
01:05:28:09 - 01:05:51:21
Stefan
Talk and lop. Okay. Open source experiment tracking for training ML models okay. LLM
Development dev tool, San Francisco I think this is a YC company. Can you go back up to see
which one was YC. So we know for the last three. So yes, Ciroos not. But the last two are okay.
This one's going to be cool because it's dev tools.
01:05:51:21 - 01:06:14:25
Stefan
We like dev tools. Backed by Y Combinator x 25. So they're in their spring batch. X 25 is all
about AI. The ML ops platform built for modern teams. The open source way. Which is it, the
MLOps platform or the open source platform? The open source platform. They copy our landing
page. We need to change that the open source platform for tracking, optimizing, collaborating
on machine learning experience.
01:06:15:01 - 01:06:20:29
Stefan
Okay, you know what? I like the open source platform, but I'm biased.
01:06:21:01 - 01:06:53:23
Jens
I don't like it. Because if you say open source, that means you need to build two businesses.
You need to build an open, a successful open source thing. And then after that you have to build
a successful business, which we have done. It took a couple of years. It's extremely hard. We
almost died. So just by doing it that way, I would say, yeah, it's it's already almost dead just
because it's hard.
01:06:53:25 - 01:06:55:19
Jens
Okay.
01:06:55:22 - 01:06:57:18
Stefan
So,
01:06:57:20 - 01:07:08:26
Jens
This is something that probably people who understand models, they would understand it better.
It seems to be sophisticated.
01:07:08:29 - 01:07:19:21
Jens
Okay. They are they are definitely leveraging tailwind here for the better. This looks cool.
01:07:19:24 - 01:07:22:08
Jens
Open source. Powerful. Fast.
01:07:22:10 - 01:07:24:23
Stefan
What do you pay for though if It's open source.
01:07:24:26 - 01:07:57:23
Jens
Yeah, that's my point. So what are they selling? They sell. Let's talk , with storage. Okay. Yeah, I
think, so here's my take. Landing page is cool. I guess if you build models, which I'm not sure if
so many people these days built models, I think more like like open AI builds models. I think it's
cool.
01:07:57:26 - 01:08:19:12
Jens
The biggest problem I see is it's absolutely unclear how they will do, on the, on the go to market
side, if we go to GitHub, they have 306 stars. So if it's not hundreds of thousands then I'm not
sure 0.01 they shipped.
01:08:19:13 - 01:08:20:04
Stefan
Two weeks.
01:08:20:06 - 01:08:21:16
Jens
Very early.
01:08:21:19 - 01:08:24:22
Stefan
Yeah. But two weeks ago was the last time they shipped.
01:08:24:25 - 01:08:32:23
Jens
Okay. That's that's crazy. Like, take a look at this GitHub calendar graph.
01:08:32:25 - 01:08:38:08
Stefan
Cosmo 32 weeks 19 we shipped 19 minutes ago.
01:08:38:08 - 01:08:46:19
Jens
Okay, thats an active startup.
01:08:46:21 - 01:08:49:08
Stefan
Why did they ship two weeks ago?
01:08:49:10 - 01:08:56:15
Jens
Good question. Maybe they are busy with some other stuff. But yeah, let's go to our board.
01:08:56:15 - 01:09:00:23
Stefan
real Quick though. We have a question from somebody. How many open PR is on GitHub?
01:09:00:26 - 01:09:05:16
Jens
Okay. Open PR one sick. Let me go back.
01:09:05:19 - 01:09:08:09
Stefan
Okay.
01:09:08:12 - 01:09:12:23
Stefan
Pop.
01:09:12:26 - 01:09:26:29
Jens
One issue and this pull request there never was a pull request. They they just started yesterday.
01:09:27:01 - 01:09:31:28
Stefan
I don't know, they really did.
01:09:32:01 - 01:09:34:12
Jens
Okay. I don't know. It's early.
01:09:34:12 - 01:09:38:16
Stefan
I think they're too. I think they're too early to judge.
01:09:38:19 - 01:09:39:01
Jens
Let's see.
01:09:39:04 - 01:09:45:25
Stefan
Are they solving a real problem?
01:09:45:28 - 01:09:58:09
Stefan
I agree with this statement. I just don't know what they're selling. I don't even know what the
problem that is that they're solving. I think they're too early to judge Jens
01:09:58:11 - 01:10:21:12
Jens
Yeah. Impact. Maybe it's a it's a real problem, I don't know. My question would also be if you go
the open source route, why like could you not do it as a closed source service and sell
something? I my personal opinion is as a startup you should always try and sell something and
not just build something. Differentiation.
01:10:21:14 - 01:10:33:01
Jens
I'm not the person to ask gut feeling I don't know this, I I'm not even like coinfli means 5050. I'm
I'm not on the on the 5050 side here.
01:10:33:03 - 01:10:54:28
Stefan
I'm going to put just all rip because I did two weeks is kind of crazy and they're in the spring
batch. So I guess maybe they just did demo day. You know what could have happened, by the
way? They could have done Demo Day and not gotten any funding. Yeah. Could be could be.
Okay. Last one, please be a unicorn.
01:10:54:28 - 01:11:09:05
Stefan
Please be a unicorn. Here we go. Text AI collaborative one SMS, WhatsApp telegram away
mobile messaging San Francisco YC backed, text.ai okay let's see I.
01:11:09:08 - 01:11:12:15
Jens
I don't have a good.
01:11:12:18 - 01:11:27:22
Stefan
Collaborative AI one. Discover local eats, plan group events, settle debates.
01:11:27:24 - 01:11:44:04
Stefan
Let's see. We have us a good statement from. Is this you? Actually I think this is what was your
use case. Most startups build around open source tooling and typically start building the open
source project at Big Tech. Jens. And see potential in offering it as a service. And a few execs
start a company around it, it's kind of your your path.
01:11:44:09 - 01:11:48:27
Stefan
a little bit.
01:11:48:29 - 01:12:27:10
Jens
Yeah. I, I agree with David, I would have also put a little bit space up here. Okay. But I think I
know what they do. So they give you collaborative AI on WhatsApp or something so I can have
a chat. I see. So text AI find us pretty hiking spots around Malibu. Okay, so you have a group,
and then you have an AI in this group.
01:12:27:12 - 01:12:54:21
Jens
Life search assistant in the conversation text ai what does Busan mean in slang? Okay. Get
answers instantly. You're a search assistant. I'm curious how they, how they will do the pricing,
where is the pricing.
01:12:54:23 - 01:12:59:03
Jens
1.5 million messages. Served. That's like nothing.
01:12:59:05 - 01:13:02:22
Stefan
Scroll down. Okay.
01:13:02:24 - 01:13:07:00
Jens
There's no pricing.
01:13:07:02 - 01:13:22:19
Stefan
FAQ, go to FAQ yeah, this might be B2C SaaS it looks like anybody can use it. It's free up to ten
messages every 12 hours. Jesus. I send that in like 30seconds.
01:13:22:22 - 01:13:25:05
Jens
Wheres the business model.
01:13:25:07 - 01:13:32:26
Stefan
I think it's free for now they’re going for growth. Then why would they limit the amount of texts.
01:13:32:29 - 01:13:36:12
Jens
To save costs?
01:13:36:14 - 01:13:42:20
Stefan
I don't get, I'm going to put no on this one.
01:13:42:25 - 01:13:54:13
Jens
You know what my biggest problem is? Like, why is the why is the hero so close to the top?
Like, it just feels off, like, here's space. Like use it.
01:13:54:15 - 01:14:12:27
Stefan
Scroll down. Let me see the demo. Okay, let's go hiking this weekend. Text ai find us some
pretty hikest. Here are some trees. Which one? You okay? Like, it's kind of a cool approach. I
think it's going to not get killed by open AI by Apple. Like what? What's stopping Apple? Yeah,
exactly. Apple intelligence already does this or will in a week.
01:14:12:27 - 01:14:16:10
Stefan
Like yeah like you'll eventually be able to just text AI.
01:14:16:13 - 01:14:25:05
Jens
Stefan if I say okay Google then my phone does that
01:14:25:07 - 01:14:33:12
Stefan
Okay to tier list. I don't even think we need to go and do the criteria. Okay, this was a sad day.
01:14:33:14 - 01:14:48:06
Jens
Are they solving a real meaningful problem? Nope. Unique? Nope. Is it going to work out?
Nope. So we haven't found any unicorns.
That's so sad. Real quick though, I think it's important that we shared this part right here. Hold
01:14:48:09 - 01:14:59:01
Stefan
up.
Yep, it's a bubble. We are 100% in a bubble right now.10 startups its 1,000% a bubble. Oh my
01:14:59:04 - 01:15:12:04
Stefan
god.
01:15:12:06 - 01:15:33:17
Jens
I don't understand one thing, Stefan. It seems to me like when you look at getting into, YC, it
looks like, hey, this is like so super hard and whatnot. And we look at these companies and it
feels like, I don't know, how did they make it?
01:15:33:19 - 01:15:56:16
Stefan
I don't know, I think, by the way, I was thinking this, all those companies had in their like thing
backed by YC I wouldn't put backed by YC because my customers don't care in three and a half
years of building wundergraph None. None of our customers ever ask, hey, who funded you
guys? They've never cared. Why do people put that?
01:15:56:19 - 01:16:18:11
Jens
Okay, chat. What? What do you think? How how did they made it through the YC filters? I
thought it's hard to do, like, interviews and everything. Like how? How do you think it's possible
that they, they, they got to this point also like I don't know 21 million. It's it's crazy. I don't get it.
And.
01:16:18:13 - 01:16:19:21
Stefan
Honestly good question.
01:16:19:23 - 01:16:21:07
Jens
Who funded us.
01:16:21:10 - 01:16:30:15
Stefan
All right. So Aspen wood funded our seed and then Karma Ventures and eBay and Aspen Wood
in the series A. So what about who's.
01:16:30:15 - 01:16:44:28
Jens
writes or she. But.
Who's s by the way it sounds like Nithin, but like from from the guy from the, the the way he
We're totally in a bubble. What's funny is David said that we built a staircase. Yeah, we did
01:16:45:01 - 01:16:54:06
Stefan
actually.
01:16:54:09 - 01:16:54:28
Jens
Okay, this is.
01:16:54:28 - 01:16:56:06
Stefan
Depressing.
01:16:56:08 - 01:16:57:25
Jens
Stefan. Okay. That's next.
01:16:57:25 - 01:17:05:11
Stefan
finish jens?
Think why so much? That's the YC. Speaking of funding, when does your when does your yacht
01:17:05:13 - 01:17:28:27
Jens
Yeah. Speaking of yachts, just the other day I was, you know, you know, you know how I have,
when I was 18, I had a really bad accident. I almost lost one. One of my legs. Since then, I'm,
I'm. I have a disability, and, like, I can walk, but not hike, or stuff.
01:17:28:29 - 01:17:59:23
Jens
And, this got me into into circles with people with uh, disabilities, people in wheelchairs and
stuff. And just the other day, I was contacted by someone they do a project in Tanzania, where
they help kids, build a wheelchair because, in Tanzania, like many kids, if they, you know, they
get born and they , I'm not sure what is the right term, but they have like an, their, their back is
open, so they need, like an operation.
01:17:59:27 - 01:18:24:09
Jens
Otherwise they would actually die. And after they get this operation, which there's a German, a
German doctor, she, she flies there on, on her own money, operates tickets to help them. But
the problem is they don't have a wheelchair, they don't have a wheelchair. And so I was
contacted by by someone in the in this, wheelchair,
01:18:24:11 - 01:18:25:11
Stefan
Wheelchair.
01:18:25:14 - 01:18:54:29
Jens
Circuit, whatever. And they ask me, hey, can you can you, maybe donate something, and help
us, building up like, like a, they want to help the people in, in Indonesia, in Tanzania that they
actually build the wheelchairs themselves because, like, buying them from Germany or
something, like in Germany, for example. A wheelchair costs around 4 to 5 K if you build it in
Tanzania, it costs around 250 bucks.
01:18:55:01 - 01:19:00:11
Jens
And so they try to get some material there and build it up. So yeah. Speaking of.
01:19:00:11 - 01:19:01:15
Stefan
Yachts.
01:19:01:17 - 01:19:26:07
Jens
I just, put a little bit of money into into actually helping them. And if someone else, wants to join
and help, kids who almost died in Tanzania to, to get a wheelchair, then, you can you can DM
me and then follow up. It's like, so good. Speaking of what founders do with their money.
01:19:26:09 - 01:19:32:22
Stefan
Spoken like a true politician. You went completely around the question, when is your yacht
done? Is what we want to know.
01:19:32:24 - 01:19:34:19
Jens
Nobody cares about yachts.
01:19:34:21 - 01:19:51:18
Stefan
Oh, awesome. I thought this was building. I thought about giving them money about a yacht
instead. Would have been a horrible end. But guys, thank you so much for joining us today. This
was a great episode of The Good Thing. Jacob is going to clip these. You'll see them on social
media one last time. Let's give a round of applause to all these startups.
01:19:51:20 - 01:20:03:08
Stefan
Building startups is hard. We hope that some pivot. We hope that some survive. We hope that
all survive. But that's the end of our episode. We'll see you. Oh, wait. Actually, what's the good
thing Jens?
01:20:03:08 - 01:20:07:01
Jens
We’ll See you next week.
01:20:07:04 - 01:20:15:16
Stefan
See you next week. Bye guys.
01:20:15:19 - 01:20:17:27
Stefan
I wonder if I'm supposed to turn it off or Jacob turns out.
