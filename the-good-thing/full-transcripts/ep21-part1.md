Episode 21
type: podcast-chunk
00:00:18:28 - 00:00:19:13
Jens
And we're.
00:00:19:13 - 00:00:27:29
Stefan
Back. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing. I'm joined
by my co-host, as always, Jens. Jens how are you doing today?
00:00:28:01 - 00:00:35:06
Jens
I'm good. We we. You can't imagine. We just wasted, like, I don't know, ten minutes.
00:00:35:08 - 00:00:36:27
Stefan
To figure out the game.
We're going to play today.
00:00:39:00 - 00:01:00:15
Stefan
Yeah apologies guys. So we're going to be playing a game. And it took us ten minutes to to kind
of figure it out. We were explaining and then the end goes, well, why don't we just explain this
on the podcast? Yes. Okay. But, today we have a cool game. If you guys remember a couple
episodes ago, we did it like an improv, roasting, landing pages.
00:01:00:15 - 00:01:26:04
Stefan
So we roasted all landing pages, and we were trying to figure out, like, if it's a good landing
page because we were trying to take inspiration for ours. Today, we have a the good thing 2025.
I start up, tier list. So what we're going to be doing is our content producer organized about ten
AI startups that we haven't heard about, and we have a category ranking, which I'll actually
show you right now, real quick here is here the good thing I start up tier list and we have five
tiers.
00:01:26:08 - 00:01:43:24
Stefan
This is going to be unicorn. This is going to be the new open AI. It will survive most likely to B or
C. So it might IPO it might get acquired but it'll survive. There's a good chance that it could
survive. It probably get acquired somewhere in between the stages. This one is a total coin flip.
We have no idea what will happen with that one.
00:01:44:01 - 00:01:58:10
Stefan
And then we have a RIP. It's most likely going to die. We're going to go through ten, ten
startups. All of them are down there. So you'll see Thunder code. Now, I've never heard of
these, by the way. This is crazy. Like being so deep in the space. Like I have not heard of any of
these Jens.
00:01:58:13 - 00:02:00:10
Stefan
Have you heard of any of these?
00:02:00:12 - 00:02:06:10
Jens
No, but I guess the goal for today is we will destroy ten dreams, right?
00:02:06:12 - 00:02:17:05
Stefan
Well, it depends. One, we're going to find out if we would be good VCs because we're seeing it.
Yeah. We'll put our tier list and then we'll revisit it in five years. And then we'll see how well we
did.
00:02:17:07 - 00:02:20:03
Jens
What do you know about VCs?
00:02:20:05 - 00:02:37:27
Stefan
I know a lot, to be honest. I know that sometimes they don't know about anything. So it'll be
good to see how good we do when we're evaluating companies. And then from that point, what
we'll do is we'll put them into these categories and we'll actually see how well we did, and then
we'll discuss. So let's get started.
00:02:37:27 - 00:02:41:06
Stefan
Let's share your screens Jens.
00:02:41:06 - 00:02:41:28
Jens
And by the way.
00:02:42:05 - 00:02:43:04
Stefan
00:02:43:06 - 00:03:18:19
Jens
Audience we're also curious about your opinion. So if, Yeah, let let's get into it and, and see
what do you think about the startups. Okay. So this is a tier list. So our producer said everybody
on the internet does tier lists. And the interesting bit is I have never heard about tier lists, to be
honest, because I'm, I'm super busy doing, startup, but, Jacob or Stefan, can you explain to me
what is a tier list?
00:03:18:21 - 00:03:37:21
Stefan
Okay, so a tier list is like a list S being like world class, the best, the unicorn, and then DF, rest in
peace. Shut down immediate. And so you just hear them within those rankings. So when we
evaluate the startup we're going to look at and we're going to be like okay wow this is a fantastic
tier list.
00:03:37:21 - 00:03:41:12
Stefan
Yeah David cut it out. So my my knowledge.
00:03:41:14 - 00:03:44:15
Jens
For tier list is F.
00:03:44:18 - 00:04:01:06
Stefan
Not very good. Not very good. So basically you just rank them A or S obviously the world class
and then A B C D just kind of like how you're grading you know like you have the grades. That's
what the tier list. So we're grading basically these startups on their potential to be a unicorn. It's
kind of funny though.
00:04:01:06 - 00:04:06:16
Stefan
It actually is a generation gap. Like my generation knows this. Your generation doesn't. I guess.
00:04:06:18 - 00:04:10:20
Jens
Yeah, it sounds like I'm getting a little bit old.
00:04:10:23 - 00:04:15:03
Stefan
It might be the case, but all right. here's the criteria.
00:04:15:06 - 00:04:28:00
Jens
Yeah. Criteria impact differentiation and gut feeling. Can I add one criteria because I think the
criteria number four should be, will OpenAI kill it.
00:04:28:02 - 00:04:32:20
Stefan
only.
It's a good one. Honestly I think you can edit that slide. Oh no. Just kidding Jacob made it view
00:04:32:20 - 00:04:37:20
Jens
But really what?
00:04:37:23 - 00:04:45:24
Stefan
Jacob is going to make it, so we can add to it. So yeah, let's add it. Will it get killed by OpenAI? I
actually kind of like that one.
00:04:45:27 - 00:05:01:19
Jens
Okay. Are they solving a real meaningful problem? Are they unique or are already being
outplayed? Does it feel like it's going to work out gut feeling okay. And then will OpenAI nuke it.
00:05:01:22 - 00:05:03:02
Stefan
Also I kind of like that better
00:05:03:04 - 00:05:14:06
Jens
producer.
So here's another view. And by the way, if I had to put the PowerPoint skills of Jacob, our
00:05:14:08 - 00:05:19:06
Stefan
On the tier list, what's the tier like? Dude, what are you.
00:05:19:06 - 00:05:27:21
Jens
Oh, okay. No, I see what you're doing. So this this. Why is it okay? That is Y Combinator
companies, right?
00:05:27:24 - 00:05:36:08
Stefan
Yeah. This generation gap or we're struggling here. I got it in the first second right there. So Y
equals funded by Y Combinator okay.
00:05:36:08 - 00:06:06:21
Jens
But I think you're you're formatting is off I I'm okay anyways. Founder code I have never heard
about it but sounds interesting. Marblism, Klavis, Lumona, Hyperbound, mao. That's probably
from China, Amy, Ciroos, and then M:lop and text.ai. I I think text.ai will definitely die like
absolutely no chance even even just from the name.
00:06:06:21 - 00:06:11:04
Jens
But okay, let's see. Stefan, should we start?
00:06:11:06 - 00:06:13:22
Stefan
Let's start with number five.
00:06:13:24 - 00:06:23:14
Jens
What we start with number five. You mean like slide Five, five, five? Okay. ThunderCode, you
can read, I do slides, you can read.
00:06:23:16 - 00:06:42:27
Stefan
Okay. So the tagline is the AI testing agent for your software team. The industry of software, QA
and dev tools. I already know it's not going to make it because it's in Paris. No, I'm kidding.
Paris, France and Tunisia. Okay. And then here are the links. Let's start with the website first. So
far. Yeah, I kind of don't know what they do.
00:06:43:00 - 00:06:55:27
Jens
You have a point because I think it's a it's a huge disadvantage to not be in San Francisco. So
everybody who's not in San Francisco, you you immediately got a negative point.
00:06:55:29 - 00:07:06:16
Stefan
All right. It's the nature of the beast. Okay. Let's give this a sec weâ€™ll both look at in and then
we'll go into it. Of course the cookie banner got to be in Europe.
00:07:06:17 - 00:07:13:24
Jens
Cookie banner is very important because this is a French company. It's in the EU.
00:07:13:26 - 00:07:15:14
Stefan
Very good job. There.
00:07:15:17 - 00:07:24:29
Jens
Okay, cool. The AI testing agent for your software teams. What Problem are they solving.
00:07:24:29 - 00:07:28:24
Stefan
Again, I don't know. It's the AI testing agent.
00:07:28:27 - 00:07:42:00
Jens
Oh. Nobody knows. Right. That's. No, that's no problem. It's just a thing. And. Yeah, so they
should have used AI to test their hero because it's meaningless.
00:07:42:02 - 00:07:49:26
Stefan
demo and then.
I also don't get the pricing look There's no pricing at the top. So I guess you have to book a
00:07:49:28 - 00:07:50:26
Stefan
Let's try and.
00:07:50:26 - 00:08:23:12
Jens
Transform manual testing into automated success. Create, manage and run automated tests
with the power of AI. No coding required. Thunder code helps QA teams deliver better software
faster. Okay, I give you like one very big tip. If you if you if your pitch. Is with the power of AI.
What you're telling me is we do something with computers and that is the most boring story
ever.
00:08:23:12 - 00:08:35:20
Jens
Like I cannot stand anymore to see with the power of AI. Sorry, it's. I really don't like it. That's. I
don't know how you think about it, Stefan.
00:08:35:22 - 00:08:55:27
Stefan
It's kind of the same way. It's like, yeah, hey, we do something with technology like they're just
throwing in the word AI in front of, like, I guess they're an AI company. You know what this feels
like to me? This is like the .com boom. Do you remember? Like, everybody was just
adding.com? Like there was pets.com, which was like exploding the website for whatever.
00:08:55:27 - 00:09:07:04
Stefan
And people just adding.com.com.com. Com we go up go up. That's actually huge right there. AI
powered test, AI agents, auto healing tests streamline. What problem.
00:09:07:10 - 00:09:17:12
Jens
Solving. What's the. All right I don't get it cross-platform test. So like yeah everybody does that
comprehensive test on analytics I don't.
00:09:17:12 - 00:09:28:15
Stefan
Know wait, wait. The first points are actually important. That should be there. Write test cases in
plain English and let our AI transform them into automated tests. That's not bad.
00:09:28:17 - 00:09:44:12
Jens
You know what the hero needs to be? The hero needs to be. Write tests in plain English. Save, I
don't know, ten hours. Whatever.
00:09:44:14 - 00:09:55:14
Jens
Powerful integrations. Nobody cares. Enterprise grade security. If you don't have that, then
okay, what do customer say?
00:09:55:16 - 00:09:57:18
Stefan
00:09:57:20 - 00:10:08:15
Jens
a tool ...
Integration with GitHub was smooth, automated test. Okay, that's not compelling. I finally found
00:10:08:18 - 00:10:11:24
Stefan
00:10:11:26 - 00:10:33:01
Jens
Okay. Who are those people back at developer QA. Lee, DevOps engineer. You need to be
super careful. Like, we we we need to see the, the messages from leaders, from management,
not from developers. We're not selling to developers. We're selling to decision makers.
00:10:33:03 - 00:10:33:18
Stefan
If you go up.
00:10:33:18 - 00:10:37:18
Jens
Overall, I think it's pretty tough. Where is the pricing? Stefan.
00:10:37:21 - 00:10:39:20
Stefan
There is no pricing. Click on the product page
00:10:39:20 - 00:10:49:27
Jens
use it.
Book a demo okay. With this book. A demo like it's AI it's so simple to set up. Why can I not just
00:10:49:29 - 00:10:53:05
Stefan
Click on the product.
00:10:53:07 - 00:10:54:01
Jens
What product?
00:10:54:02 - 00:10:57:03
Stefan
On a product I want to see.
00:10:57:05 - 00:10:59:02
Jens
You want to watch it?
00:10:59:03 - 00:11:11:06
Stefan
No, Let's do it like this is way early actually. Hold up. I would have sped that part up.
00:11:11:09 - 00:11:19:15
Stefan
Okay, this is definitely a very early stage startup okay. Features.
00:11:19:17 - 00:11:28:18
Stefan
Target market. What does that mean? Quality assurance practices.
00:11:28:21 - 00:11:34:00
Stefan
Now I'm going to be completely honest with you. This UI is horrible.
00:11:34:02 - 00:11:36:28
Jens
Are they part of a YC batch?
00:11:37:00 - 00:11:38:12
Stefan
They are not.
00:11:38:14 - 00:11:42:03
Jens
No. Okay. I would have never invested into this company.
00:11:42:05 - 00:11:45:22
Stefan
Okay, so let me flip to screen. Let's go to the tier list.
00:11:45:24 - 00:11:46:18
Jens
What is below F?
00:11:46:18 - 00:12:07:28
Stefan
Yeah okay. Hold up. All right. So what were they? They were thunder code. We're going to put
them in rest in peace. Yeah, yeah. Goodbye. Go back go back to the criteria list on slide three.
Yeah. Okay. Are they solving a real meaningful problem. They are not I really I don't know I don't
know.
00:12:07:28 - 00:12:09:28
Jens
I donâ€™t know What they are solving.
00:12:10:00 - 00:12:31:04
Stefan
They're automating QA tests okay. But it is a meaningful problem. Is it real I don't know, are they
unique or are they being outplayed? I think that they're super early. I don't see any difference to
like using postman or just setting up like any of your other tooling. I don't know what do you
think Jens. any differentiation.
00:12:31:06 - 00:13:06:12
Jens
I mean, the first thing, you can only have impact if you are able to clearly articulate the problem
you're solving. So we didn't see that. So no differentiation are they unique I mean they are
uniquely bad. That's definitely something that that stands out. Gut feeling. Does it feel like it's
going to work out? I'm honest with you, with the feedback we have now provided, they could
actually they could actually pivot because, like, I don't want to offend the people behind it, but,
oftentimes I saw that startup founders are quite smart.
00:13:06:12 - 00:13:32:04
Jens
They are just not good at creating startups. So, maybe these smart people can put the ego
aside and, yeah, try a different approach. So that that will OpenAI nuke it? I don't think that's
OpenAI. will attack automated testing. I don't think they they care about such a such a tiny
market compared to let's do AI for everybody.
00:13:32:06 - 00:13:39:13
Stefan
I agree, but follow up question though, could AI nuke it?
00:13:39:16 - 00:13:42:17
Stefan
I think OpenAI, if they want it to go into this market, they could, but.
00:13:42:17 - 00:13:55:13
Jens
I don't think so. By the way. Put put the put the put the thing from here. I cannot can I click on
this show, yes. Jens. Founder said I think startup founders are smart.
00:13:55:15 - 00:13:58:26
Stefan
Yeah. Of course.
00:13:58:28 - 00:14:00:06
Stefan
No, I.
00:14:00:09 - 00:14:13:19
Jens
Said that because I also have empathy. You know, if you if you look at the WUnderGraph
website in the time back machine, at the very early days, you will see how much I sucked. So,
yeah.
00:14:13:21 - 00:14:30:21
Stefan
But that's the whole point of any founder, by the way, is you embrace the suck like you're
supposed to suck. Startups are the most counter-intuitive thing in the world that every time you
think you're doing something right, you learn, oh wait I'm doing everything wrong. So feedback
is a gift. Take it or leave it if you like it. Do whatever.
00:14:30:23 - 00:14:49:10
Jens
Here's my here's my feedback what they can do. So these are smart guys maybe. And they
found that I can do testing better. So they created a solution. And now they are looking like okay
what kind of problem can be solved with it. Just go the other way around. Just start with what
problems do you see in the world?
00:14:49:13 - 00:15:03:08
Jens
And if you want to use AI to solve it, fine. If you want to use Kubernetes also okay. Just code
also fine. If you don't write code at all, it's also good. So yeah. Try again.
00:15:03:10 - 00:15:16:23
Stefan
I love this, by the way, from David. So next week, Jacob writes this down for the next, session,
but we should do a founder tier list. We'll, we'll put together, like, I'll send a list of founders I like.
You'll send a list of founders you like, and we'll do a tier list and rank them and we'll put
ourselves into there as well.
00:15:16:23 - 00:15:21:13
Stefan
But if we compare oh, I.
00:15:21:15 - 00:15:28:27
Jens
I know 100% for sure. I'm the best CEO at WunderGraph.
00:15:28:29 - 00:15:33:23
Stefan
There it is. The Jens joke. All right. Ggo to slide six.
00:15:33:23 - 00:15:39:08
Jens
Let's see this next one. Marblism.
00:15:39:10 - 00:16:08:12
Stefan
Wait. Is this a YC company? Okay. So their their latest batch is kind of cracked. They have a lot
of AI stuff, so productivity automation dev tools. The tagline is AI employees who love overtime.
That's kind of scary HQ San Francisco. So they already have a leg up. Let's see. Yeah. Let's
see the website.
00:16:08:14 - 00:16:09:05
Stefan
Oh, it's kind of cool.
00:16:09:12 - 00:16:11:12
Jens
Interesting design.
00:16:11:14 - 00:16:21:12
Stefan
I kind of like it. It's kind of like comic book. Andy Warhol oh, that's really creative.
00:16:21:14 - 00:16:48:23
Jens
So the first thing that catches me is the design, and I can click on these kind of things, and this
is cool. Instead of giving instead of just creating like ten agents and call it this, that they, they
gave them name like, hey, you can have Stan or whatever. All right, let's see. AI, employees that
work for your business grow your business with a team of AI employees who love overtime.
00:16:48:26 - 00:16:54:04
Stefan
It's okay. I kind of love there. Can you scroll down? Is there a scroll down or. No.
00:16:54:07 - 00:17:21:14
Jens
Yeah, but you know what I instantly like? Could be fake or not. If it's. If it's fake, shame on you.
But if it's true, 7820 businesses on boarded. It that's that's pretty dope. Just one thing. If you say
onboarded, that means they have created an account or something. Like what? What have they
achieved? Like, talk about the achievements.
00:17:21:20 - 00:17:26:25
Jens
What are the results you have delivered? Not just about. Yeah. Who signed up.
00:17:26:28 - 00:17:43:06
Stefan
Let me tell you though. Wait go up real quick. I loved, the people that they've put in. Like what
you saying? They gave them names. Linda, sunny, Eva, Kara. And you know what they're doing
here. They're humanizing it. Like, people are like, oh, I was going to take all our business, and
they kind of are playing away from that.
00:17:43:06 - 00:17:51:07
Stefan
It was like, no, you can work with Linda or Sunny or Eva. It's a very good psychological trick. But
so far I love the landing page. Okay.
00:17:51:09 - 00:17:56:10
Jens
AI employees, OK In total it's just six, but.
00:17:56:12 - 00:18:08:17
Stefan
All right now, is this something to set your day with? No social media? Not anymore. Thanks,
Brendan. Everything keeps getting pushed to next week. I don't know, ask Dustin about that
one. No, not our problem.
00:18:08:17 - 00:18:20:03
Jens
Problem. But I'm honest with you. This is great because they now filter the audience so if you
say, okay, this is my problem, then awesome.
00:18:20:05 - 00:18:32:14
Stefan
have to hire quite.
Meet your new team, stop struggling AI employees handle email social support so you don't
00:18:32:16 - 00:18:39:12
Stefan
You know what I really like? They're telling us. They're telling a story.
00:18:39:14 - 00:18:43:18
Jens
Okay, I can I can click on this.
00:18:48:18 - 00:19:04:09
Jens
Okay. It's an interactive session. Okay. I can talk to my social media manager in a in a chat. And
they do stuff for me.
00:19:04:11 - 00:19:15:20
Jens
I love the demo. Now talking to The executive assistant. Okay, well, would have been awesome
if I can click on something. But this is still very good.
00:19:15:22 - 00:19:35:21
Stefan
Okay, so they're doing what super human does, by the way. That's what superhuman does. And
it's super productive. I like this so far oh look at this. But did you see that? It says you stayed till
the end. Youre exactly what we're looking for. Use this discount code to get. So they're filtering
for like champions, people that will stay and help build with them.
00:19:35:21 - 00:19:37:02
Stefan
I love that.
00:19:37:05 - 00:19:48:14
Jens
Yeah. And then right from the demo I can I can sign up and everything. And to be honest this is
experienced founders. This this is pretty good knowledge.
00:19:48:17 - 00:19:49:24
Stefan
And I want to see if their experienced founders.
00:19:50:00 - 00:19:51:21
Jens
Good on them.
00:19:51:23 - 00:20:06:05
Stefan
This. Go down below to the next to the next one okay. Here we go. So marblism saves time. I
mean, here's the quantifiable stuff 92% satisfaction. Okay, 4.8 10,000 tasks completed by AI
employees every week.
00:20:06:08 - 00:20:13:25
Jens
Five I, I just give a little bit of feedback. Can you just put this here?
00:20:13:27 - 00:20:16:09
Stefan
Yeah.
00:20:16:11 - 00:20:30:20
Jens
What why why do I have to like if you, if you put, like, what is it called. Scroll. If you put scroll
depth on this website, how many people scroll until they get here versus see it here and then
yeah, maybe put it up.
00:20:30:22 - 00:20:36:14
Stefan
I would add post hog too to the website and see where people scroll down to.
00:20:36:17 - 00:20:40:26
Jens
Average cost savings. Okay.
00:20:40:28 - 00:20:44:20
Stefan
Okay. Money back guaranteed.
00:20:44:22 - 00:20:50:03
Jens
And then let's see the pricing pricing pricing.
00:20:50:05 - 00:20:51:16
Stefan
00:20:51:18 - 00:20:55:25
Jens
They have different pricings.
00:20:55:27 - 00:21:02:03
Stefan
Oh it says it right there. It's right there, the bottom left. So you see per higher year wow I.
00:21:02:03 - 00:21:07:00
Jens
Did that's invisible. Are they crazy.
00:21:07:02 - 00:21:15:17
Stefan
I think is, is that for all of them you get 25, $29 a month or is it per employee?
00:21:15:19 - 00:21:24:04
Jens
What do I pay? 29. And it could cost 119. I'm confused.
00:21:24:07 - 00:21:25:25
Stefan
And I don't know.
00:21:25:26 - 00:21:36:04
Jens
What will it really cost? And why can I click on multiple. Like what? Okay, this is what they do.
What is the pricing.
00:21:36:06 - 00:21:42:29
Stefan
What if you click on the pricing or get started for free? If you click on Get Started for free.
00:21:43:01 - 00:21:46:00
Jens
Yeah this, signs me up again.
00:21:46:02 - 00:22:06:26
Stefan
Oops. Do you have the link to navigator? By the way? Nope. I was going to say I want to look
up the founders. I don't know if this is an experience. It's on there. Go back to the slide? The
LinkedIn's on there Okay, go back.
00:22:06:28 - 00:22:18:02
Stefan
Okay. So this is a very early stage. Click insights okay. click on people.
00:22:18:04 - 00:22:25:23
Stefan
Oh okay. Awesome. Oh I don't know. But I think he looks pretty young.
00:22:25:25 - 00:22:28:00
Jens
That doesn't mean much.
00:22:28:03 - 00:22:28:21
Stefan
This is all.
00:22:28:21 - 00:22:44:24
Jens
Okay. But yeah, I, I, I would change a little bit the pricing. I would put the price here and I would
make it clear that I pay for everybody or one. Lets rank it. Okay. Should we go through the
checklist?
00:22:44:26 - 00:22:49:06
Stefan
Yeah. Head back to the to the presentation.
00:22:49:08 - 00:23:08:13
Jens
And by the way, this sounds like it might cost 119 or maybe 29. I'm really not clear on what are
we getting. Yeah. Anyways, let's go back to our criteria, Stefan. Impact. Are they solving a real
meaningful problem?
00:23:08:16 - 00:23:23:13
Stefan
I think they are. This would be great for agencies or small to medium sized businesses that don't
have the resources to hire a paralegal to an executive assistant to social media manager. I think
they are solving a real, meaningful problem. What about you?
00:23:23:15 - 00:23:40:18
Jens
Yeah, I agree, like I I'm not sure where I would put it, like how burning it is and stuff, but it's it's
clear what problem they solve. I get it the different personas. I like the execution. What do you
think about the differentiation other unique.
00:23:40:20 - 00:23:49:18
Stefan
I think they are. I think the way that they spun the angle and like, they have it like cartoony and
hiring your AI staff, I think it's really unique.
00:23:49:21 - 00:24:21:08
Jens
I disagree on this because if you if you look again here on the demo. What they really do is I
have five chats and each chat is an agent that has a system prompt and some tools and that
does some stuff, and then they maybe have an integration with the email and whatnot. the tech
is pretty simple.
00:24:21:10 - 00:24:31:28
Jens
very, very thin.
So I, I really don't see the moat that, that is, I don't want to say it's, an AI wrapper, but it's, it's
00:24:32:01 - 00:24:41:08
Stefan
I would disagree here though the comic book feel is cool but I don't think that their audience is
enterprise. I think it's small to medium sized businesses.
00:24:41:11 - 00:24:52:04
Jens
Yeah, I, I think Stefan, David has a point that with, with the comic style, you're definitely not
pitching this to enterprise.
00:24:52:06 - 00:24:57:26
Stefan
Yeah, let's rank them. Gut feeling. So we we.
00:24:57:28 - 00:25:02:24
Jens
We disagree here. That's fine. Gut feeling, is this going to work out?
00:25:02:26 - 00:25:23:10
Stefan
So I have a friend building in this space. He knows five other people building in this space,
which is AI agents or AI employees. I think that there's so many AI agents, AI employees, I put
them in the middle tier. I don't know if it's going to work out because there's so many in this
space. What about you?
00:25:23:12 - 00:25:50:24
Jens
Doesn't work out. And second, open AI will nuke the shit out of this. And I tell you why there is
deep research you just can't compete with, with the, market reach of OpenAI. They have deep
research, and deep research has tools. And in deep research you can just click a button and
connect your, your, Google your email.
00:25:50:26 - 00:26:14:03
Jens
You can connect your Google Drive. And if you figure out it's a good prompt, it does this stuff
like and in the future there will also be connections to social media and others and with the right
prompt it can also do your social media. So, I, I don't see them succeeding long term.
00:26:14:05 - 00:26:20:02
Stefan
Are you going to connect it to your Instagram?
00:26:20:04 - 00:26:21:09
Stefan
I know where.
00:26:21:09 - 00:26:22:23
Jens
You're going with this.
00:26:22:25 - 00:26:24:03
Stefan
So okay.
00:26:24:08 - 00:26:28:22
Jens
Like my wife, my wife has Instagram.
00:26:28:24 - 00:26:35:05
Stefan
I wouldnâ€™t put them in rest in peace. Iâ€™d put them in coin flip. Would you agree?
00:26:35:08 - 00:26:43:01
Jens
We definitely should differentiate, the, the trash bin from from this company. Yes.
00:26:43:04 - 00:27:08:12
Stefan
Okay. Cool. So we'll put them into coin flip for now. I think that they might get acquired, they
might have some success, but they are definitely not in the trash bin for now. Very cool concept,
very difficult. Yep. Next one. Yep. Klavis mcp integration for AI applications. Okay, this one is
going to be interesting because it's in dev tools and infrastructure.
00:27:08:14 - 00:27:20:04
Stefan
Good HQ it's in San Francisco is this this is also a YC backed company. All right let's check it
out. So far the tagline and I'm not sold on it just seems like a lot of tech.
00:27:20:06 - 00:27:30:19
Jens
Yeah. If I read MCP, I already think the the the term is just I don't know a handful of people, but
okay.
00:27:30:21 - 00:27:53:12
Stefan
You let's take a look. By the way, cursor yesterday announced like some big update and 17,000
people worldwide saw it. And somebody was like, Holy crap, we're in a bubble. Like everyone in
our industry is talking about cursor, cursor, cursor, cursor, cursor. But only 17,000 people saw
the their latest update. I think that kinda shows you like holy crap.
00:27:53:12 - 00:28:10:16
Stefan
Like it's huge. So yeah,Jenstagram. But that's why I'm just trying to get to point is I think we're in
a bubble. As soon as you see MCP your Tam is tiny. So let's go through this. To be honest, I
think you should go through this one. This one is pretty technical, so start us off Jens.
00:28:10:18 - 00:28:34:02
Jens
MCP, Model context protocol. MCP integrations for AI applications. Okay. I'm not sure what it is
the best way to get access to production ready MCP service at scale. What problem are you
solving?
00:28:34:05 - 00:28:40:18
Stefan
Wait, wait, so what do they do? They get. It's an easy way to get access to MCP servers?
00:28:40:21 - 00:29:07:27
Jens
I don't know. Okay, let's try it. So you make a Post request to this API, you create an MCP
server. This needs my API key okay. And then server name user ID platform name okay. It it it, I
don't know what it does. It's not this is not self explanatory. Integrate any tool or MCP server you
like.
00:29:07:29 - 00:29:37:28
Jens
So I somehow assume that I can use this. And they will give me an MCP server that talks to all
these things. I guess, maybe, let's click MCP servers. Okay, I think my assumption is right, but
why can they not say like. I, what is David saying?
00:29:38:01 - 00:29:49:10
Stefan
No, Diego. So ten years ago that would have read API integrations for cloud applications. It
yeah, it's the same amount of info. I don't get this. What does this mean?
00:29:49:13 - 00:30:10:14
Jens
Okay, so I think what you what you want to say. Like I can rewrite your hero. So your hero is so
let's say I don't know, let's say this are 4040 applications. Okay. And here what they what they
say here, connect chat GPT to more than 40.
00:30:10:14 - 00:30:11:08
Stefan
Apps.
00:30:11:11 - 00:30:37:06
Jens
In one click. That's what you're doing. Your problem is that. And we can actually cut it short here
because this is sorry but this is it's it's dead at the beginning. ChatGPT allows me to connect
MCP servers with one click. It it already exists. So this startup is already dead. So we can we
can just wait.
00:30:37:06 - 00:30:43:16
Stefan
I want to see the premise of this. Yeah.
00:30:43:18 - 00:30:44:19
Jens
I don't know.
00:30:44:19 - 00:30:57:08
Stefan
One Hundred API calls a month. Okay. Unlimited access. MCP clients. Is there any social proof?
I love the enterprise CEO and CTO support. That's what we used to do.
00:30:57:10 - 00:31:00:27
Jens
What? Yeah, okay. Two people A 2 A 2 person startup
00:31:00:29 - 00:31:03:02
Stefan
00:31:03:04 - 00:31:10:27
Jens
I'm sorry, I'm an ass. Okay. This this is not going to work. Zero chance.
00:31:10:29 - 00:31:17:12
Stefan
the curriculum.
So I think I would agree. Okay. And then I go to the tier list. Now let's actually go to real quick,
00:31:17:12 - 00:31:22:08
Jens
Are they solving a real problem. No they don't because OpenAI.
00:31:22:10 - 00:31:23:07
Stefan
00:31:23:10 - 00:31:34:27
Jens
Doesn't have this problem. So it's also not differentiated gut feeling guys do something else. You
have you have YC backing. Just pivot.
00:31:34:29 - 00:31:38:22
Stefan
Okay. It was Klavis. Rest in peace.
00:31:38:24 - 00:31:42:28
Jens
It was Klavis. Yes.
00:31:43:00 - 00:32:03:03
Stefan
Okay. Sorry, guys. Oh. What happened on the slide? There we go. Okay, here we go. Lumona
AI enabled search engine featuring insights from social media. Okay. Search. Search is a very
big industry. A very big problem, San Francisco. Let's go. I think that there was.
00:32:03:06 - 00:32:13:29
Jens
This one line.
Take a moment at and look at how Jacob formats slides. You see here everything is one line.
00:32:14:02 - 00:32:22:09
Stefan
Like bro, you had one job.
00:32:22:12 - 00:32:29:01
Stefan
It's so funny here. I knew you were going to say that. Yeah. All right, let's see the website.
Lumona does an AI and image.
00:32:29:01 - 00:32:32:18
Jens
Search engine featuring insights from social media.
00:32:32:25 - 00:32:38:29
Stefan
By the way, David has a good point. Arent search engines already using AI. Well, let's see what
problem they solved. But yeah you're right.
00:32:39:01 - 00:32:48:21
Jens
But step on. It's AI enabled. It's, it's a whole new game. Okay, I cannot scroll. I can just search.
00:32:48:23 - 00:32:53:22
Stefan
Search? What does lumona do?
00:32:53:24 - 00:33:02:08
Jens
It lets me search.
00:33:02:11 - 00:33:09:01
Stefan
This is dead in the water. This is chatgpt?
00:33:09:03 - 00:33:10:27
Jens
Yeah. It's chatgpt
00:33:11:00 - 00:33:14:22
Stefan
This is chatGPT or perplexity.
00:33:14:24 - 00:33:18:26
Jens
Yeah, but why? We already have it.
00:33:18:29 - 00:33:29:15
Stefan
I don't get this.
00:33:29:18 - 00:33:33:16
Jens
Hey. AI enabled search insights from social media.
00:33:33:16 - 00:33:38:29
Stefan
know.
Oh, okay. So it gets social media insights. Go back. Let me see the results. Right. Oh, you
00:33:39:00 - 00:33:53:00
Jens
You know what the difference is. Instead of searching the web they search social media. So that
I can see what people on social media think about most authentic Italian restaurants in New
York City.
00:33:53:03 - 00:34:00:03
Stefan
Well, let's see what social media said about their startup though. Ask it.
00:34:00:05 - 00:34:08:03
Jens
That's a cool idea. What does social media say?
00:34:08:03 - 00:34:16:03
Stefan
against Reddit.
Said their primary goal is to not make you put reddit in the query mode. You're competing
00:34:16:06 - 00:34:18:20
Jens
Lumona did I spell it right?
00:34:18:22 - 00:34:24:27
Stefan
Yeah.
00:34:24:29 - 00:34:30:17
Stefan
Okay.
00:34:30:19 - 00:34:46:29
Stefan
Like ready to print? Founded in 2023. Heres what lumona offers. Okay. It's, it's innovative
approach By leveraging insights from platforms.
00:34:47:02 - 00:34:55:14
Stefan
Okay. With proper attribution.
00:34:55:16 - 00:35:09:27
Stefan
This is a tough one. Okay. I'm going to put it into the I'm going to put it into the bin like it's a very,
very hard thing that they're solving. Let's see the criteria.
00:35:09:29 - 00:35:13:00
Jens
Are they solving a real meaningful problem?
00:35:13:02 - 00:35:23:24
Stefan
I don't think so. Like you could just add Reddit to the end of the query. Plus you can just type in
chat GPT. Now I've been using chat GPT for search way more.
00:35:23:26 - 00:35:28:20
Stefan
Plus I think OpenAI will completely nuke this.
00:35:28:22 - 00:35:36:01
Jens
Oh, OpenAI has more compute. They have more of anything. I, I don't see it happening.
00:35:36:03 - 00:35:42:09
Stefan
Okay. Sorry, guys. Okay. See my.
00:35:42:10 - 00:35:44:03
Jens
Hyperbound.
00:35:44:05 - 00:36:02:03
Stefan
Okay. I like the name already, siimulated AI sales role play platform sales enablement. This is
also YC Badge company, San Francisco, of course. And hyper bound AI not to be confused with
hyper mode. Correct. This is hyper bound. Okay, I really.
00:36:02:03 - 00:36:14:22
Jens
Really hope that now we see a hero that solves a problem. I really hope. Let's see. Please.
00:36:14:24 - 00:36:34:22
Stefan
Hyper bound AI scales coach (I dont know) now we're talking.
00:36:34:24 - 00:36:51:13
Jens
I would make this bigger because from my experience, you absolutely want to figure out your
top reps. The behavior and replicate this across the whole sales team. That's great.
00:36:51:16 - 00:36:56:17
Stefan
So let's see.
00:36:56:20 - 00:37:14:15
Stefan
Yeah, all these websites do look the same. It's kind of funny. They all did just get one shotted
okay. So try free demo, book a demo. Wait I don't is that the same call to action? Does try free
demo make you book a demo. In this book a demo lead you.
00:37:14:18 - 00:37:18:03
Jens
Try a free demo book a demo.
00:37:18:06 - 00:37:26:03
Stefan
Yeah, click on try free demo. Where does it take you?
00:37:26:05 - 00:37:31:18
Stefan
Oh, okay.
00:37:31:20 - 00:37:35:08
Jens
Okay, now, now I can start the call and everything.
00:37:35:10 - 00:37:38:01
Stefan
Want to start it, it looks kind of cool
00:37:38:03 - 00:37:43:29
Jens
Book rate 9.2% 14.
00:37:44:02 - 00:37:48:00
Stefan
Wait click on one, though. What's a European style call? that's funny?
00:37:48:05 - 00:37:49:18
Jens
Where is European style.
00:37:49:21 - 00:37:59:11
Stefan
Scroll down. You got to scroll down. Keep going. It's one of these blocked off ones right there.
Right there. Rude, European style.
00:37:59:13 - 00:38:01:27
Jens
Probably with a German.
00:38:01:29 - 00:38:09:15
Stefan
Probably. Wait go up to one of them. Let's start the call. Let's see it. click start call.
00:38:09:18 - 00:38:17:15
Jens
Okay. I don't want to sign up now. But it's cool. cold calls.
00:38:17:15 - 00:38:19:24
Stefan
Discovery.
00:38:19:27 - 00:38:43:24
Jens
I, I'm not the sales expert. But could be useful, I guess. Let's see. Trusted by reps from over
7000 companies. I don't trust that. But maybe. It's a lot of whitespace, actually.
00:38:43:26 - 00:38:51:24
Stefan
Are these testimonials? That's actually quite good. They have a lot of testimonials.
00:38:51:27 - 00:38:59:22
Jens
Okay. And they say it on YouTube. Yeah. That's strong.
00:38:59:24 - 00:39:05:23
Stefan
The wall of love.
00:39:05:25 - 00:39:08:24
Stefan
Oh, that's actually very. Yeah. This is very strong.
00:39:08:27 - 00:39:10:24
Jens
Good, good social proof.
00:39:10:26 - 00:39:13:08
Stefan
Click on enterprise.
00:39:13:10 - 00:39:26:06
Jens
One sec. here we go. This increased. Okay. It's good.
00:39:26:09 - 00:39:30:29
Jens
The process built for enterprise.
00:39:31:01 - 00:39:41:17
Stefan
Software to integrate with Salesforce HubSpot. Correct. SSO to be honest, I think this is a great.
00:39:41:20 - 00:39:45:12
Jens
Pricing.
