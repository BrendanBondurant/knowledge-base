00:29:05:17 - 00:29:23:29
type: podcast-chunk
Stefan
And then from there it was just, I guess a snowball effect. And so for me, everything, you know,
you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. And
so now looking backwards, like there's so many things we could have done better, but also like
there's no way we could have known to do them better as first time founders.
00:29:23:29 - 00:29:30:18
Stefan
And when we look back, it's, you know, it's a short history, but it's what Bjorn said. It's an
absolutely rich history.
00:29:30:22 - 00:29:32:23
Jens
What about trucks?
00:29:32:26 - 00:29:51:17
Stefan
Okay. And then so we, we got even a little bit more creative. So the drama is and I'll say for the
podcast, I bought a ticket and a plane ticket and a, hotel room to go to New York to go to
GraphQL, GraphQL summit, not Apollo Summit. GraphQL summit. I thought it was open to
everybody.
00:29:51:19 - 00:30:08:15
Stefan
And, I get this email. It's like, hey, thank you for your interest. I was like, it's not interest. I bought
the ticket. And they go, thank you for your interest to, GraphQL summit, but you cannot come.
And then for the reason it was just left blank. They didn't even tell me why I can't come. And
then I was like, okay.
00:30:08:15 - 00:30:19:22
Stefan
And then I asked Bjorn I was like, hey, did they refund that tickets? Like, yeah, we got the
money back. So I was like, well, that's rude. Like, why can't I go to the what they call GraphQL
summit? And so, you know, we started brainstorming and I got a little petty about it. And I was
like, you know what?
00:30:19:23 - 00:30:36:17
Stefan
Why don't we just hijack that conference too and this is what we call guerilla marketing, which I
think really needs to make a comeback. When companies do this, it's it's really funny. And so
what we did is we rented for three days, LED trucks for the first day and the last day they were
parked right in front of the conference, and they would turn on at 8 a.m..
00:30:36:17 - 00:30:54:18
Stefan
And so when people were walking to the conference, they would see it. We luckily got a spot
because, we paid the truck driver a little earlier, a little money to go a little, earlier. So he went at
5 a.m. and held a spot from 5 a.m. till, 7 p.m. and we would bring him lunch and he would just
sit there with the truck, and people were walking by.
00:30:54:18 - 00:31:13:03
Stefan
They were taking pictures with the truck. Apollo wasn’t very happy, but not what you can do. And
then they had an after party on the next day. And, I don't know how I secured this parking spot,
but right in front of the entrance to go to the bar that they were celebrating at, that also was
great because, this was kind of in October.
00:31:13:03 - 00:31:29:11
Stefan
So it got a little bit darker earlier. 6 p.m. was the party. And then all of a sudden, 601, these
bright lights about Cosmo turn up right in front of the venue and to get into the venue, into, like,
where the venue is and where the truck was, is maybe five feet or, like, not even like a meter.
00:31:29:11 - 00:31:50:28
Stefan
And so you absolutely see that that truck. And so we did that. And then we also hired a guy to
just hand out fliers and the impact was I mean, they announced some exciting stuff for their end
and they got a couple impressions. But our trucks got thousands of impressions. And, you know,
it's fun. It's good banter and, you know, if it's if it's called the GraphQL summit, you might as well
let everybody go.
00:31:50:28 - 00:31:59:00
Stefan
It did more harm than good. But yeah, it's been a journey. Those are some of the challenges.
But what about you Björn? What are some of the lessons or challenges from your end?
00:31:59:02 - 00:32:17:12
Bjorn
So just wanted to comment real quick on, our marketing stunts. I think what really, makes a
difference if you're a startup and you really care well, the startup, when you're a founder or you
know you belong to the staff and you really care, is that you do exceptional stuff that people
don't expect, and you're very creative.
00:32:17:12 - 00:32:36:11
Bjorn
So I think one of the the things that make us mighty is that we've got a lot of fresh ideas and a
team, to make them happen, which is awesome. So, like, you can't direct people to do
something like that. It's, you know, the creativity that come just comes up and say, let's do this
spacesuit thing. Let's do the fed pretzels.
00:32:36:14 - 00:33:07:10
Bjorn
And I hope we can retain this. It would be one of the challenges that we can retain that spirit for
as long as we can, because once it becomes like a corporate operation, it's it's not going to be
original anymore. You know, it's not going to be, something that you can really touch. And I think
also one thing that sets us apart from other companies is that we really we are, a way more
professional company now that we were in 2023, but we still try to retain the hunger and the
focus on the customer and to do the things that really move the needle.
00:33:07:13 - 00:33:27:19
Bjorn
And, this, I hope, will be our DNA for here on out. I mean, no matter how how big wundergraph
gets eventually. Because the people that benefit the most from that are the customers. If people
really care and they're are creative and they don't get, you know, lazy and over satisfied with
stuff, it's going to be a great outlook going forward for everyone.
00:33:27:22 - 00:33:45:08
Bjorn
So one of the key challenges was, seeing that you as the, the challenger in the market, get kind
of, bullied aside by the incumbent, let's put it that way. So it's like we take it as banter. That's
totally fine. And I think there's there's no harm done. We're professionals. Everybody should be
cool about it.
00:33:45:08 - 00:34:01:19
Bjorn
But it's really hard if you enter a market that's basically dominated by a single player and you
have to make your your voice heard, it's like Jens said, apollo is very loud, so you have to do
something. You can scream as loud, but you have to be creative in terms. And we didn't know if
that would work.
00:34:01:19 - 00:34:12:00
Bjorn
So we, started. I think it was everybody liked us at, at the conference. I mean, I just recall those
four apollo people turning up front of the booth.
00:34:12:02 - 00:34:12:27
Stefan
And trying to intimidate us.
00:34:13:03 - 00:34:44:21
Bjorn
Yeah, but I think nobody really any of them, like, took us seriously back then. It's different now.
So if one thing an advice maybe for in large players in the market, if you think you need to
suppress or, distract your competition, even if it's, you know, a lot, a lot smaller than you, by just,
you know, excluding them from events that are meant for the entire community, it's actually a
signal, that this challenge is much stronger than you want to make it appear.
00:34:44:29 - 00:35:02:19
Bjorn
So this is where we took a lot of motivation from because we saw that reaction and, we knew
we were on to something also thanks to our customers. And this just gave us more drive, more
energy, going forward. And now looking back at the time, I think now the, the, the scales have
tipped a little bit.
00:35:02:19 - 00:35:19:27
Bjorn
We're still the challenger. Apollo. Still, is the incumbent. But, a lot of things have changed. We're
gaining market share. We're traction. We gained traction. We've got a really competitive
products, and there are so much more to come. This year is going to be super interesting.
00:35:19:29 - 00:35:26:03
Stefan
Yeah. Well, said, I mean, keep the mic because I think this goes to you, but, we're here in
Bretten, we're on the working retreat.
00:35:26:03 - 00:35:29:08
Stefan
talk to us a little bit about the realities of remote work as COO.
00:35:29:14 - 00:35:47:28
Bjorn
So for remote work, I think it's great because you can attract talent. Wherever talent is, so we're
not bound to a single geographic location. Like if we were just recruiting in the vicinity of our
office or wherever that might be, we would be so limited. And I'm super proud and honored to
work with so many fine people here.
00:35:47:28 - 00:36:11:08
Bjorn
And wouldn't have also all the people that will join us, in the future just because we're not tied to
a single location. I mean, we're an American company as wundergraph. But since we're able to
attract talent wherever they are, we get a lot more talent and a lot more, capabilities. And we
also can, you know, work a little bit more efficiently than maybe people just hiring on the West
Coast, for example.
00:36:11:11 - 00:36:30:01
Bjorn
However, this all comes at a price. So in the beginning was, let's say contained because most
people were located in Europe, except for you, Stefan. So you were the outpost, our feet in the
ground in the US, which was always our prime market right from the get go. So we knew we
wanted to expand more in the US.
00:36:30:04 - 00:36:52:02
Bjorn
And now that we that we do, it's actually challenging to get, you know, time zones, managed
and range. So between handovers of people, talking to customers, that's a lot more challenging
now. And, I think we're still finding the optimal approach to that. But also from an organizational
perspective, it's kind of tricky if you operate in different markets with different legal frameworks.
00:36:52:09 - 00:37:08:15
Bjorn
That's, for example, where Deel comes in as a partner that we work with in order to hire in some
locations, we do have an, a legal entity in Germany, for example. So that's another different
case. Then we work with contractors, which is another different case. Then we have people
employed directly in the US.
00:37:08:22 - 00:37:31:12
Bjorn
So that's a lot of tools to work with. And it was getting tough for me just handling this
singlehandedly as COO. So I'm super happy that we now have support, on that with, Alex or
head of people and culture. Which is awesome. But this is these are all things that you have to
think about when you consider a fully remote, setup and stuff like shipping hardware and so on.
00:37:31:12 - 00:37:53:27
Bjorn
That's. So you think it's just a nuisance in the beginning, but once you know, you have to ship
more stuff and you find out that actually paying someone to do that for you is incredibly it's
ludicrously expensive. So you want to do it just, you want to do it yourself. Still, it's just work.
And if you're a day just has 24 hours, even if you had the night, it's, you know, sometimes you
just run out of time.
00:37:53:27 - 00:38:13:04
Bjorn
So you have a lot of organizational stuff to cover, and it's okay, let's say, to a size of, oh, 20
people. But then it's about, to get some help with that. But I think we've managed, pretty well.
It's also part of the, the philosophy to stay lean for as long as you can until you've found product
market fit.
00:38:13:06 - 00:38:24:01
Bjorn
If you start scaling up on some organizational stuff like, you know, having someone handle the
hardware, having someone handle HR when you're just six people, what's the point? I mean, it's
the best way to run your company to the ground.
00:38:24:03 - 00:38:36:01
Stefan
Yeah. Well said, Jens? What about from you as CEO? Why remote like? Well, obviously
because we can hire amazing talent, everything like that. But what are some of your thoughts
on the challenges of running a remote company?
00:38:36:03 - 00:39:14:23
Jens
So first I would say on the on the positive side, I really like the diversity we have in the team.
Like we have people from so many different companies, different cultural backgrounds. And, I
really like, I think we have created a culture of people speaking up like everybody has a voice.
There's like, yeah, of course we have some some level of ranking, like someone needs to make
the final call, etc. but, we, we, we really like to, to give people a freedom to have some, some
creativity.
00:39:14:26 - 00:39:38:16
Jens
Like if you bring in smart talent, you can't just give them linear tickets and bucks. They want to
have something exciting to work on. So you need to to mix it a little bit. But at the same time,
what we what we realize is, like many of us, we're we're a bit introverted. We like to focus on
something like being at home and focusing on, like, a very hard task.
00:39:38:19 - 00:40:00:28
Jens
This is typically the the best environment to do it. However, when you get stuck, nobody, nobody
can see that. And it's it's very hard. Like, if you compare it to we're currently in this, in this, big
room here where ten people sit around you, if you get stuck, you're like, hey, I'm stuck. Like,
somebody take a look.
00:40:00:28 - 00:40:23:29
Jens
And the typically takes like five seconds and someone walks to your desk and helps you. So
that's the the the level of iteration is much faster. But then I also heard from from people like,
Jacob, our video guy, saying that he, he kind of believes that his, his pace on the individual
tasks at home would be much faster.
00:40:24:03 - 00:40:44:25
Jens
Yeah. Because he, he likes to communicate so much with the people here because there's, so
many interesting people. And then you want to get to know them and discuss with them. So,
kind of what, what we concluded is that as we, as we scale the company, on the, on the one
side, we, we obviously we want to stay, remote first.
00:40:44:27 - 00:41:09:28
Jens
We don't want to have, like, a primary office or something, because in an office, it can create
like an elite culture where you have the group in the office and you have the group across the
globe. And, it's it doesn't work so well. But what we want to do is, so you often hear the term
retreats, but we kind of like to say, working week or working retreat.
00:41:10:00 - 00:41:30:12
Jens
So where we simply meet, like now for, for one week, we, we work from a single place. And then
also I think once a year we want to have, like, like a real retreat, where we, where we are not
like so many hands on on keyboards, but but more workshops and more more team building
and this kind of stuff.
00:41:30:14 - 00:41:34:14
Jens
But yeah, I think that's my, my current perspective on the topic.
00:41:34:20 - 00:41:41:04
Stefan
Yeah. Was an and Dustin for you talk a little bit about how it's coming. Oh go ahead I'm going to
do the same with it. But okay.
00:41:41:12 - 00:42:16:06
Dustin
I think yeah, I think hiring is also another factor. It becomes even more challenging because
you're not just looking for a developer. You're also looking for someone who is very a very good
communicator, like I have. I have seen developers, great developers, great engineers, but
they're lacking communication skills. And in such an environment where you're sitting in front of
the desk and, you have to be if to communicate, blockers you have to the teach, mentor
universe, in a remote culture, this.
00:42:16:08 - 00:42:26:13
Dustin
Yeah. You you need to be you need to be person for that, second, Hiring and, what is the other
thing?
00:42:26:15 - 00:42:29:09
Stefan
I don't know you. I was going to help you. But you took in.
00:42:29:11 - 00:42:33:06
Dustin
Hiring and, and maybe I will come back later to it.
00:42:33:09 - 00:42:55:02
Stefan
Yeah, maybe. But I wanted to know from you is, So, like, building Cosmo. It's a complicated
stack, and the collaboration is key, but how do you manage? You know, training the juniors,
helping out in the technical development and all doing this? Yeah, it might be easier a little bit in
office, but do you think remote work helps with that?
00:42:55:05 - 00:43:00:05
Stefan
That you're able to space it out specially across the time zones that we have?
00:43:00:08 - 00:43:28:29
Dustin
To be honest, I would say no. It is even more challenging to to build a relationship with, with,
with people on the internet. If you hire people from India, US, Spain, the culture is different. You
have to first learn, the culture differences. And I think this is very challenging and, yeah, but that
it we had no choice.
00:43:29:25 - 00:43:40:21
Dustin
So, yeah. And we were super focused on our end results. And, if you're, if you hired the right
people with the right mindset, I think you can make it. Yeah.
00:43:40:23 - 00:43:41:01
Stefan
Yeah.
00:43:41:07 - 00:43:43:03
Dustin
And so I remember my second point.
00:43:43:10 - 00:43:44:29
Stefan
Oh, okay. We're back to.
00:43:45:01 - 00:44:08:19
Dustin
What was, it was like, I think if you would have an office, it is pretty easy to have a bird view on
your team. Right? If you want to establish that in a company, in a remote company, you have to
figure out the right tools. What tools to your do you want to use to to have this almost near
workplace, environment.
00:44:08:22 - 00:44:33:07
Dustin
Yeah, right. We use linear like very innovative towards, were not using Jira. We use linear. We
use slack for customer support. I mean, you can tell more about that. Yeah. And, I think this also
important that you use the right tools to embrace this, this culture that fits almost like I want to
talk to my my friends next to me.
00:44:33:09 - 00:44:34:01
Dustin
Yeah.
00:44:34:04 - 00:44:52:28
Stefan
There was an one thing that I would add on the remote work is, you guys might not know this,
but, Bjorn has three kids, all under ten. Jens has three kids under ten. Dustin is married and I
am married. And the benefits about remote work is so so, so for the ladies. So for the ladies.
00:44:52:28 - 00:45:11:16
Stefan
Sorry. Like we my wife, you know, nothing. But, the benefits of remote work is, it's really
important family. Because, I mean, what's the point of building $1 billion company if you do it
alone? You know? And the cool thing about having three other co-founders is you get advice.
You also get to build that bond with each other.
00:45:11:16 - 00:45:29:20
Stefan
But also we're really focused on giving people the freedom to come to work and work on what
they love to do and with remote work. You allow them to have a life. There is no, you know,
commute to the office. There is no boring like, I have to come into the office and work. And so
this hybrid approach that we have, I think it works best because you have your life.
00:45:29:27 - 00:45:48:13
Stefan
You work on wundergraph where hopefully a significant but small part of your life, and then you
have these working retreats where you come in for a whole week. You're just with the team and
it's it's what Jacob and Jens said. Like it might not be the most productive week product wise,
but for culture and for the roadmap, it's the most productive week.
00:45:48:19 - 00:46:08:28
Stefan
You get rid of zoom fatigue, you come back and the whole team has this camaraderie. And like
my coach, I would just call rah rah. So yeah, rah rah. And then you're just excited to just go
back. And I think that's one of the benefits. And so we're nearing a little bit on time. What I want
to talk about now is it's interesting and it's going to be fun because I have three Germans with
me and they're very direct.
00:46:08:28 - 00:46:15:18
Stefan
So what do you love and what do you hate about wundergraph. And I'll start with you, Bjorn.
00:46:15:20 - 00:46:36:27
Bjorn
Just wanted to add one more comment about the family thing. What's super challenging if you
have a family and if you work at home because you're physically there, but you were maybe
mentally elsewhere, like talking to your, to your colleagues. So it's it's a challenge to keep these
worlds separated when they need to be separated. Even though you can take a lot of advantage
of being you're right there.
00:46:36:27 - 00:46:57:10
Bjorn
So you can do stuff. And, it's also tricky to find people who understand the balance. So, I mean,
we're kind of at the forefront of these things. We understand how hard it is sometimes, and we
wouldn't be here if it wouldn't be for our wives, you know, holding holding the fort sometimes
back home, like hearing this, the kids screaming downstairs and like, fuck, that sounds like a
war.
00:46:57:10 - 00:47:19:20
Bjorn
So you feel like you're on vacation sitting in front of your computer, just having a civilized talk.
And downstairs it's mayhem. So it's hard. And it's not just it doesn't require us to be compatible.
It also requires the rest of the family to be compatible and understanding. And it's it's tough. You
know, if you're just left for the office in the morning and returned at 7:00, different story.
00:47:19:23 - 00:47:37:12
Bjorn
And, also what's important when when you work in a remote company, you need to be able to
travel. That also has become, one of the critical things to discuss, during the hiring process. For
example, if you can't travel and can't meet the people you're working with every day, you're not
made for remote work. Simple statement.
00:47:37:14 - 00:47:37:17
Stefan
I like it.
00:47:37:17 - 00:48:08:29
Bjorn
. So what we what we love and what we hate about wundergraph. I love the company. It's kind
of it's, the thing I always wanted to do, like, build a company from the ground up. Don't repeat
the mistakes I've seen so many years over, in different companies in the past. So to me, it's one
opportunity to make up for, you know, all the hardship that I had to sometimes go through as a,
you know, mid-level manager being right in the sandwich position or just being, you know, a
project manager at the beginning of my career.
00:48:09:01 - 00:48:26:15
Bjorn
You learn so much, during a time and once you get the chance. And this is really the one in a
lifetime thing, to make a difference, to actually make a difference and build a different company
culture. That's absolutely what I always wanted to do. And what I really love about
WunderGraph, I love that we don't know everything.
00:48:26:22 - 00:48:47:10
Bjorn
So we, we don't claim to, you know, be the, ultimate, wise people in the room. We have a lot to
figure out, and we're honest about it. Like, we're like, we're not claiming to be, like, super smart.
And we are know it alsl, we also make mistakes and we work with these make mistakes
because there's a culture of, you know, if you fuck up, you can beep me out on that later.
00:48:47:10 - 00:49:07:11
Bjorn
Jacob. So if you fuck up, we can talk about it and learn from it. I think this is super critical. That's
what I love. What I sometimes struggle with is, friction in a remote company. Yeah. Because if
you have conflicts and conflicts are human nature, so there are conflicts. It's so easy to
misunderstand each other on slack.
00:49:07:14 - 00:49:29:12
Bjorn
On a call just by writing, you know, short message. Even if one of our principles is, always
expect best intent or assume best intent. It's not easy. So to to prevent friction sometimes just
doesn't work. And it's great when we meet because that's, you know, those things usually don't
happen when we meet. But if you don't, it's hard.
00:49:29:12 - 00:49:51:29
Bjorn
And sometimes that's taking a lot of energy when you actually just want to focus on work. And I
think a lot of people, would feel that way. And, sometimes it lacks the, the feeling of, you know,
being the real team in a room. I mean, we're still the same team, but it's different. Like having
everybody here doing a cool hackathon kind of exercise, you know, everything is the hurrah,
spirit.
00:49:52:06 - 00:50:02:21
Bjorn
You know, we all go for the same goal, and we have something to ship, and everybody's
excited, and there's so much energy in the room. Sometimes this doesn't transpire. Through
Zoom or Slack or something like that.
00:50:02:26 - 00:50:08:00
Stefan
Yeah well said.
00:50:08:02 - 00:50:14:09
Jens
Okay. Love and hate for first one thing on the on the family part, you know.
00:50:14:10 - 00:50:15:10
Stefan
Coming back.
00:50:15:13 - 00:50:28:06
Jens
Family. Family is important. Everybody has a family. And we also want to hire people that have a
family, because we we we like having a family. Like, we think it's a good thing.
00:50:28:08 - 00:50:29:26
Stefan
The good thing.
00:50:30:01 - 00:50:31:01
Jens
At the same time,
00:50:31:01 - 00:51:01:21
Jens
with your with your family in, in, remote company. Not every day can be the same. And so,
because two of our, founders have, together, like, not be together, but we have six kids already.
We we are very understanding of of what family means. And we have kind of built a, a mindset
where we are very much, results focused, but not exactly hours focused.
00:51:01:28 - 00:51:25:06
Jens
So if if someone works for our company and they have together a kid from kindergarten or
someone is ill, like it happens all the time and they have to to make a break for two hours like
nobody bats an eye. What really matters is that at the end of the month, we're getting our work
done and in every other regard, we're we're, we're we're kind of flexible.
00:51:25:08 - 00:51:52:14
Jens
And then there's also companies, they they say like, hey, your startup is your family or whatnot.
Our mindset is we are like an elite sports team, and every member has their family. Sometimes
it feels a little bit that that founders, are a little bit more than just colleagues because, like, life
and family and being a founder, it blends, into each other.
00:51:52:14 - 00:52:21:08
Jens
Because if if something doesn't work and it's weekend. Yeah, it doesn't work and it's your
company and then somebody has to fix it. So this, this can happen. And then on the, on the,
love and hate part, I think like one of the biggest things I love about wundergraph. So we, we
have super smart people within the company, but we also have super smart company around,
people around the company.
00:52:21:11 - 00:52:48:23
Jens
And so I would say we're super lucky that we work in, in the market where we work with, like,
principal software engineers or senior architects at Uber, Paramount and eBay and other
companies. And these are all like very smart people. We learn a lot. It's it's great to interact.
Like, I'm a self-taught engineer, I, I don't have the curriculum that gets you into a Google.
00:52:48:23 - 00:53:09:21
Jens
But now we work with all these cool companies together. So so that's that's, an amazing thing. I
would say another positive thing is we never had too much funding, so we had to be smart in
how we use it. And I think it kind of forced us to be, I don't know, to, to be very efficient in
everything we're doing.
00:53:09:21 - 00:53:32:28
Jens
So I think that that really helped. The one thing I would say I don't like about WunderGraph,
sometimes I miss the, the, the days where we had an office. I drive there in the morning, I do my
work. And then I stopped doing my work, and I drive home. And that's the day, like, you know,
before, I went into IT, you know, I, I'm a self-taught.
00:53:32:28 - 00:53:57:15
Jens
I, I stumbled into this because of an, accident with the truck. I was a carpenter. And as a
carpenter, you drive to your job, you do a couple of things. You do some some work with
whatever, or you drive to some some, clients, and you repair, something like a door for them or
whatever. And then you drive home and that was it.
00:53:57:15 - 00:54:09:03
Jens
Like, now work stops. And with wundergraph, it never stops. You always have something to do.
And you, you kind of have to set boundaries. Like where work stops and that's really tough.
00:54:09:05 - 00:54:13:10
Stefan
Yeah. Well, said I already know Dustin's.
00:54:13:12 - 00:54:22:08
Dustin
Well, what I love about work, I think it's the whole learning experience. I think we grew so much
altogether in, I don't know, in light, light, speed.
00:54:22:10 - 00:54:23:14
Stefan
Yeah like two and a half years.
00:54:23:17 - 00:54:49:02
Dustin
Two and a half years, I don't remember. Yeah. That's huge. Different from what Stefan was
before. Two years. What Jens was before two years. It's it's amazing. Yeah. And what I hate is a
strong word I would say. Yeah. Hate. I think, it's nobody should underestimate, being a founder.
It's especially in a successful company.
00:54:49:02 - 00:55:13:09
Dustin
It is stressful. Yeah. And, I think also very critical is that you're. I would I would like to just shout
out to our families and to our partners. To wives, I think this is also critical. And, Yeah. To to to
survive such a journey that you have to the right, you have to need the right partner, the right
family and.
00:55:13:11 - 00:55:39:28
Stefan
Yeah, well said, for me what I had, I think they touched on all the points. But I mean, there's so
much I love about WunderGraph, but there's a special feeling when you get together with a
couple guys that you met for the first time on the internet in a small working space in Frankfurt,
and you take it to a point where you know, you have to get a whole conference room to foster
everybody in, and there's all these small little stories.
00:55:39:28 - 00:55:56:01
Stefan
And so what I love is that all these people that are joining our our vision, they have families and
they have their own lives and us wundergraph. What we built. We get to be a small part of their
life a little moment and hopefully it's a really positive moment. So I love that. And what I hate is, I
wish we could do this more often.
00:55:56:01 - 00:56:10:20
Stefan
I wish, I wish we had 100 million in funding so we can do a retreat every month or something
like that. So that's the only thing I hate. But I'm really excited for the journey that we have going
forward. And then to close this out, because we are almost that time, it's interesting to
understand where we're going as a company.
00:56:10:20 - 00:56:30:00
Stefan
So we started off with this interesting pivot, and we've obviously blown past that. We've added
features that only Cosmo has within the stack. We've built amazing relationships with
companies. We have exciting news coming soon, but from a product point of view and also
company point of view and a technical point of view and a customer point of view, where do you
see the future of WunderGraph?
00:56:30:00 - 00:56:45:09
Stefan
And I'll start with you, Jens, because it's interesting. I don't want to take your mojo of what we
talked about, but the money isn't an infrastructure. Where is the future and where do we see
Cosmo evolving into?
00:56:45:12 - 00:57:14:22
Jens
Great question. So I think, first of all, what we start to see in the, in the market and what we,
what we want to support in the future is, we really like the concept of federation federating data,
allowing many, many clients to talk to many, many different data sources. And then it's not just
clients today like the, the, the newest client on the block, it's AI.
00:57:14:24 - 00:57:51:29
Jens
So I think what we see much more in the future is, is AI interacting with, with a, APIs, with data.
And the best way to have AI talk o talk to APIs is by having a schema. And GraphQL is super
great at designing the, the schema. But at the same time, what what we see in the, in the
market and this really influences our, our long term direction, I would say, we very much double
down on the idea of federation, but we are less and less attached to the idea of GraphQL.
00:57:52:02 - 00:58:20:11
Jens
So GraphQL for us, it is one way to federate. But I think in the future we, we will see more ways
of, of federating different data sources. And a federated graph. It doesn't have to speak
GraphQL. It can also speak REST or maybe it speaks, gRPC on the client side, and also on the,
on the backend side, we, we see more and more demand to connect.
00:58:20:13 - 00:58:50:11
Jens
AI to your graph. We see demand to connect search services. REST APIs, Soap. So we're
heavily investing in in ways of, yeah, making the graph more powerful. All of this under the
umbrella of Cosmo, which means open source Apache 2. We're we're, absolutely against any
sort of license change, or we don't want to have an enterprise version.
00:58:50:18 - 00:59:14:11
Jens
We don't like that idea. If you look at our Cosmo Mono repo, it's still the same thing, like in the
beginning. And it's very successful. I think our our cloud has very reasonable pricing for the
value you get. Our customers are happy. We're very happy with this business model. So, to
every to everybody who doesn't believe in open source and having a source for us, it works
really, really great.
00:59:14:11 - 00:59:43:24
Jens
And, like one thing that keeps coming up in sales calls is that that people say, like, hey, we want
to use your, your, cloud service, but we really like that. It's open source. So in case anything
happens, there's, there's insurance. And also we can always look into the, into the code. So
that's kind of like, what, what we have planned with Cosmo and then we're, we're currently
building a completely new product.
00:59:43:27 - 01:00:06:24
Jens
And this product we we don't yet want to share, like, too many details, but, like, information that
is already public is if you look at the announcement from our seed round. Yeah, we said with,
with the 3 million in seed funding, I it's no joke. I actually looked it up the other day, but
somehow, I don't know.
01:00:06:25 - 01:00:36:09
Jens
No, no, nobody seems to to notice or everybody forgets. But we said with the 3 million and seed
funding, we will be building the GitHub for APIs. So we already like our North Star. It was always
to build a platform to to share APIs, to collaborate, to share SDK, a place where there's
documentation, where APIs can be can be easily discovered, and all these kinds of problems in
the in the realm of collaboration.
01:00:36:12 - 01:01:05:22
Jens
And, the thing is, Dustin and I, in the very early days of, WunderGraph, we actually created the
the the solution for this. There's a blog post where we, where we, published something that
allowed you to, to publish, yeah, to publish API dependencies and share them with other people
and, yeah, we we didn't have any, any market reach.
01:01:05:22 - 01:01:27:05
Jens
We, we didn't have the, the media attention that we, we wanted to have. But since then, I would
say everything has changed. And with Cosmo, we have now such a large customer base that,
really allowed us to take, I would say, our vision. But you you can't just have a vision and build it
out and it will work.
01:01:27:05 - 01:01:55:12
Jens
But what you can do is you can have a vision, and then you work with all these enterprises, that
use Cosmo, and you never talk about your vision. You just ask them about their workflows, their
problems, and how are they doing things today. And step by step, we kind of figured out how our
vision actually kind of retrofits the problems that that our, our, customers have.
01:01:55:15 - 01:02:07:09
Jens
And so now, I would say we are very, very close and actually bringing it all together. And, yeah,
you you should expect some some big changes in the, in the upcoming months.
01:02:07:11 - 01:02:12:21
Stefan
Well Said from a technical point of view, Dustin and don't reveal too much by the. No, no, no, I.
01:02:12:24 - 01:02:45:14
Dustin
I would like to emphasize a little bit on that. I think we it's funny that we will come back a little bit
to the SDK. Right. So we'll see. So we will no longer be limited by GraphQL itself, but GraphQL
will still be the meta language, the byte code, in our product assembler or assembler to yeah, to
orchestrate to, to be the source of truth of, of the contracts of of how each data source fits
together.
01:02:45:16 - 01:02:56:14
Dustin
And we are then no longer limited by how to expose APIs or how to consume services that.
01:02:56:16 - 01:03:12:05
Stefan
Give it to björn. Because not on vision, not on product, not on tech. A lot of changes are
happening in the company. What does it mean as a COO? I mean, we just hired our first kind of
people. But what's the future of Wonder Graph as a company? Why? I'm little I'm not allowed to
speak on tech.
01:03:12:08 - 01:03:14:13
Stefan
Yeah, you can if you want.
01:03:14:13 - 01:03:19:18
Bjorn
So for us as a company, this now is the growth stage, which means we have to
01:03:19:18 - 01:03:36:00
Bjorn
professionalize or to firm up, processes that currently just exist because, you know, that's the
way we work. So we have to introduce some structure in some areas. Like, for example, we
have to streamline support a little bit in our presence in more markets where our customers are.
01:03:36:07 - 01:03:55:10
Bjorn
So this is the challenge for us as a company is scaling up, and at the same time retaining our
DNA as an engineering company. So yes, we will do something on the sales side. Yes, we will
do something on the marketing side. You will see some fun stuff there in the future as well. But
for us, the focus, will always be the engineering side.
01:03:55:10 - 01:04:18:06
Bjorn
So when you are a customer or some someone working at one of our customers and you want
to talk with us, you will be talking to an engineer who understands your use case and who is
able to help you because people really know that stuff when they communicate with you. And so
to retain this DNA and make sure this still works, and hiring the right people to actually make it
work, this will be the challenge going forward.
01:04:18:09 - 01:04:39:12
Bjorn
And I think as a company, we need to retain the spirit that we discussed earlier. So we need to
stay wundergraph and wundergraph in all our ways without you know, screwing things up too
much, but still delivering the best value, the best products with the most dedicated and the most
engaged team on the market also.
01:04:39:14 - 01:05:05:01
Stefan
And to conclude on that part just from my end, what's the future of wundergraph, For our
customers, it means absolutely nothing, because what we want to do is absolutely keep that
DNA, keep that support, keep that technical engineering DNA within it. And it just means more
use cases and the power of open source. And when you say Apache 2.0 is that you get so much
knowledge from some of the biggest companies in the world, and that's only possible through
open source.
01:05:05:03 - 01:05:21:11
Stefan
And that's why the future of WunderGraph is open source. And with that, this was our 10th
episode of The Good Thing. We started it off in January. As kind of like a joke. We were like, you
know what? Let's just do a podcast. Let's bring in for let's Talk. We've gotten really good, you
know, reviews on it.
01:05:21:11 - 01:05:38:06
Stefan
People have been watching it. And today I just wanted to thank you guys for for joining us on the
10th episode. For us being able to do this live. It's been really a fantastic experience, especially
to do it live for the first time. And then the good thing is what we wouldn't have got three years
ago. One roof.
01:05:38:09 - 01:05:39:02
Bjorn
Basically turn.
01:05:39:03 - 01:05:43:16
Stefan
Three. This is how you know Bjorn doesn't come on the podcast because we end with, the good
thing is, I just wanted to.
01:05:43:16 - 01:05:43:27
Bjorn
Throw it in.
01:05:43:28 - 01:05:50:27
Stefan
Before you and do to my what's the good thing, Stefan? What is the good thing? The good thing
is, Bjorn, we're back next week. Exactly. Thanks, guys.
01:05:50:27 - 01:05:53:27
Stefan
Okay.
