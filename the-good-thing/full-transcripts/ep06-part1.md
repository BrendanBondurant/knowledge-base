Episode 6
type: podcast-chunk
00:00:24:18 - 00:00:37:24
Stefan
And we're back. Look at that. We already have an audience waiting. Welcome back, ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us for episode six of The Good Thing. My name is
Stefan. I'm joined by my co-host Jens. Jens how are you doing today?
00:00:37:26 - 00:01:08:19
Jens
Today? It's a sunny day in Germany, so, yeah, the kids are outside, outside at some playing
round. Just sent me some pictures. via, whats app? How they are spending some time with, the
sunglasses in, in the sun. So it's great to see that. I think everybody's kind of in, good mood.
We're winding down, and, I would say rather calm.
00:01:08:21 - 00:01:16:05
Jens
Normal week. Some stuff happened this week that we can talk about. How's your week going?
00:01:16:07 - 00:01:35:13
Stefan
Okay, well, I'm in Miami, so it's always sunny. Not to brag, but, it's good. I mean, yeah, as you
mentioned this week, it's been kind of intense, so it seems like we're winding down the end of
the week. It's been a great week at wundergraph and then personally, I'm getting married next
week, so I won't be on the podcast next week.
00:01:35:13 - 00:01:52:28
Stefan
So maybe you can bring Dustin or Bjorn or somebody from our team. But I've been preparing
for that. And let me tell you, I hope to only get married once, so I never have to go through this
again. The preparation for marriage is insane, just like the stuff that we had to set up. And yeah,
that's it's finally nice that that's done.
00:01:52:28 - 00:01:58:03
Stefan
So in parallel with wundergraph and getting married, it's a lot of balancing. But one of.
00:01:58:03 - 00:02:03:28
Jens
Them, you need to be careful what you're saying. Your live, everything here, it will be in the
books forever.
00:02:04:00 - 00:02:24:17
Stefan
That's okay. Like the preparation to get married is hard. I can't wait to marry my wife. Like, I
mean, she's amazing. I mean, I'm super excited for that. But man, if I wasn't in the startup
business, I would be in the wedding business. It's crazy margins. You just organize stuff and
there you go come pay. But yeah, other than that, you know, good week and we have some
good topics to discuss.
00:02:24:19 - 00:02:32:17
Stefan
I wouldn't say that they're drama, but I'd say that there. What what would you say about the
topics we're going to discuss today?
00:02:32:20 - 00:02:45:19
Jens
Not so much drama. I mean, we're we're not. You we're not here to create drama. We're just
chatting. Yeah. What do you want to start with?
00:02:45:21 - 00:03:09:27
Stefan
So I think we should definitely start with should you copy your competitors? So that's kind of the
main theme of tonight's episode. Or for you, it's afternoon. For me, it's morning. So for today's
episode is should you copy your competitors. And it's a bit interesting and I'll add my context to
it because and you can add it to it as well, because technically we did copy a competitor.
00:03:09:29 - 00:03:13:24
Jens
We're a copycat. Right. Like from A to Z. Everything copied.
00:03:13:26 - 00:03:17:06
Stefan
Okay. Yeah. I mean that's what people say. They're like, oh, like.
00:03:17:10 - 00:03:18:13
Jens
Sarcasm.
00:03:18:16 - 00:03:38:14
Stefan
I know, but people say, oh, you're just a copycat of Apollo. And like, I think today we can set the
record straight. We can kind of give our opinion on that. And then we can also talk about people
that are copying us. And so today's theme of the episode is should you copy your competitors?
And Jens, I think you should tell the story of the early days of Wunder Graph and why copying
your competitors doesn't work.
00:03:38:14 - 00:03:41:24
Stefan
And then we'll just go into it like that.
00:03:41:27 - 00:04:15:00
Jens
Yeah, like sometimes it can look from the outside that you're copying your competitors. For
example, it would be very easy to say, oh, WunderGraph Cosmo it's a copy of, Apollo and just
ping me for it, because we will later talk about, this very topic because we're I would argue we're
in so many ways. We're completely different than we're copying almost nothing.
00:04:15:08 - 00:04:45:04
Jens
We have federation in common, but other than that. But we can talk about it. So if we talked
about the early days of Wunder Graph, I would say this is, this is probably I don't know exactly,
but let's say something around 2018, 2019, maybe, 2020 I'm not sure exactly, but in the very
early days, WunderGraph wasn't even a name.
00:04:45:04 - 00:04:54:07
Jens
We haven't really thought of Wunder graph yet, though there was actually no we. There was just
a Jens. And, I was.
00:04:54:07 - 00:04:55:24
Stefan
In college, by the way.
00:04:55:26 - 00:04:58:04
Jens
You were in college?
00:04:58:06 - 00:05:05:01
Stefan
Yeah.
So I graduated 2000, 19, 2018 of the formulation of WUnder Graph. I was a junior in college.
00:05:05:03 - 00:05:07:05
Jens
Were you still playing football?
00:05:07:07 - 00:05:19:29
Stefan
I was still playing football. I had no idea about GraphQL. I had no idea where my life would take
me. I had no idea that I would meet this man on the internet, Jens from Germany, and that we
would become very close. But I was in college.
00:05:19:29 - 00:05:43:05
Jens
Yeah, well, one thing we we had in common. I also had no idea of graphql. I still don't have it.
But, yeah, we have a bunch of smart people, you know, on, on on the, like on the podcast, or
with customer calls. I just pretend that I know how GraphQL works. And then in the background
we have our we have our team.
00:05:43:05 - 00:06:16:02
Jens
They really know how it works. Okay. But, jokes aside, in the early days, there was a hasura
like, GraphQL wasn't, Apollo wasn't yet like a real big player. There was hasura, and I was kind
of drawn to the idea of auto generating APIs from other data sources. And hasura did this in the
in the very beginning, they still kind of do it somehow.
00:06:16:05 - 00:06:25:00
Jens
But, they are currently pivoting into some, I think with, prompt QL or whatever. Yeah.
00:06:25:04 - 00:06:26:08
Stefan
Prompt QL.
00:06:26:11 - 00:06:53:15
Jens
Anyways, so I really liked, Hasura, but I didn't like some of the things how they, how they did it.
And obviously I'm, I'm smarter than everybody else. And so I build a better hasura. The
problem. So at that time hasura already had some funding and I think they already set foot in in
the US. And the GraphQL market was building together with, with Apollo.
00:06:53:15 - 00:07:17:15
Jens
Apollo also was on the run, good funding and everything. And at that time I thought if I just add
one more feature from Hasura, then I would also get users, I would get customers, I can build a
business. And then every time Hasura kind of made an announcement or something, or they,
they, they announced that they would publish something new.
00:07:17:15 - 00:07:48:04
Jens
I was like in shock because I thought like, okay, I'm now under attack and I need to counter and
I need to react and whatever. Like I still didn't have users or anything, but I thought, okay, I can
get there. So hasura they added more features, they added auth, they added this, they added
that. And, and I just thought, okay, if I keep copying what they do, and I do it a little bit better,
eventually I must get users.
00:07:48:07 - 00:08:13:27
Jens
So my theory was take a competitor, do what they do, do it better, better engineering, better
quality, better performance, better whatever. And you will win. And, yeah, that's a huge mistake
in this, in this theory. What do you think? What it is.
00:08:13:29 - 00:08:37:05
Stefan
I mean, there's a lot there's a lot to go on this is that we talked about this before is like success.
You can't ab wait your way there like you originally need. You, you always will end up needing
an original vision. And so tell the audience what was the mistake theat, you realized? And how
many years did it take you to realize that mistake?
00:08:37:07 - 00:09:10:19
Jens
I think a couple, but it really comes down to if you copy a competitor kind of in a binary way, like
feature by feature, the one thing that you that you should be very careful about is, can you copy
their audience? Can you copy the network, can you copy the brand, can you copy the reach?
Can you copy what people think about this company?
00:09:10:22 - 00:09:39:14
Jens
No, you cannot do any of that. And so the, the, the, the big realization for me is you need to
think about the distribution. And, you know, it's it's a little bit like, let's say you, you, you walk
through, through some, some older grass, it's a bit higher. And when you walk through all the
grass, you know that you can you have to what's the what's the right wording.
00:09:39:14 - 00:10:02:25
Jens
You have to, to, to push down the grass a bit with your shoes. Okay. And so if you, if you walk
such a path through this middle high grass, whatever, you can see the path of a person walking
through. And now copying features, it's kind of easy. You just follow the path of the person in
front of you.
00:10:02:28 - 00:10:42:22
Jens
The thing is, this person, they are following some agenda and you can copy their features, but it
doesn't mean that you follow their agenda, it just means you are behind them. Like you walk the
same path, but you're potentially not doing the same thing. And I think that's that's very
important. When you think about competition, like for example, if you see us doing similar
things, compared to Apollo, that is because we are in the same market, but we are not sitting
here waiting.
00:10:42:27 - 00:11:05:10
Jens
What is Apollo releasing tomorrow and how do we react to that? Because we really don't care
so much about that. Not in a negative way. Like it's just competition. But what we care about is
so we have our vision and we have our customers, and together we have like a compass. And it
tells us like, what direction should we go?
00:11:05:16 - 00:11:31:27
Jens
And we go this direction. And somewhere near us there might be Apollo, and they might also
walk in a similar direction sometimes. Maybe more, maybe less. We don't know. We're not so
interested in that. It's like, yes, the like the community, the market, it moves in the same
direction because like there compass, it points to north, ours points to north.
00:11:31:27 - 00:12:00:20
Jens
Okay. We're, we're we're walking in in that kind of direction. But just because it looks the same,
it doesn't mean that it's the same. And then coming back, if you just follow some other
companies path and you don't really have that strategy that goes behind just following them, like
your strategy cannot be, let's copy the roadmap and try to get customers at a lower price point.
00:12:00:22 - 00:12:26:01
Jens
That's you're not going to build a successful company. You need to go like, like way beyond that
in terms of of the strategy. And also if you want to be a little bit more specific, think about if
you're building a startup, think about how you communicate, or see yourself in a situation where
you communicate with investors.
00:12:26:05 - 00:13:09:18
Jens
So if you ever happen to raise money and you go to investors, investors, we'll talk about and
ask you questions about, the market and the competition. And you can't just go there and say
like, hey, there's like three other competitors. They are doing X, Y, Z, and we're also doing Z like
you. I mean, for some amount of time, you can you can do this, but if you want to raise multiple
rounds, it can't, it cannot be on the back of we're also doing X like it's going to be tough.
00:13:09:18 - 00:13:34:09
Jens
And then you also need growth metrics and other things. And for that you need the the
distribution. And just walking behind someone distribution can be can be really tough. So that's
my $0.05 on copying your competitors anything. What are your thoughts. Anything you want to
add.
00:13:34:11 - 00:13:54:17
Stefan
No I think it's right. Like I really like the grass example because copying your competitors,
especially as a first time founder, it's not necessarily a bad thing as long as you have a greater
vision. Like it's a great way to get into the market and the market is big. So if you can get into
the market a little foothold and then go your own direction with your own compass, it makes
sense.
00:13:54:17 - 00:14:16:03
Stefan
And a really good example of this. For example, a really good example of this is super base. So
Super Base started off as the open source alternative to Firebase. It's a great market database
as a service. But if you've noticed recently they raised a series C and they've completely shifted
from open source alternative to managed Postgres which is a much bigger market.
00:14:16:03 - 00:14:35:22
Stefan
Now they're competing with neon, now they're competing with AWS’s new database and they've
always wanted to be in that space. How they got into that space, though, was by being an open
source alternative to Firebase. And the same thing with Cal. So Cal.com is an open source
alternative to Calendly. And they start off just like that.
00:14:35:24 - 00:15:02:06
Stefan
But they've always wanted to be into scheduling and they've shifted completely into a complete
new offering because of their foothold now into it. And so I agree with you one thing though
about that, Jens, is, like people coming into the market like people copying things like that. What
do you think about people copying us? Like, you know, like people say like, oh, with the Apollo.
00:15:02:06 - 00:15:19:23
Stefan
But if you look like we have features that they don't, we're just in the same marketplace. But
then there are some competitors that are just doing what you used to do with Hasura. You know,
you introduce us, they introduce us, we it's like Borat. You ever see that? Like, I get iPhone, he
gets iPhone. We implement EDFs.
00:15:19:25 - 00:15:34:01
Stefan
They can't. We're too smart. No, I'm kidding, but. Well, how do you feel about that? Because we
see it all the time is that we have a copycat competitor. That doing what you used to do with
Hasura, and for me, it doesn't bother me. It's kind of funny to see, but I want to get your
thoughts on it.
00:15:34:04 - 00:15:38:27
Jens
Yeah.
00:15:39:00 - 00:16:10:18
Jens
Hi. Platzhersch, Okay, so one thing on on copying, and I like that you brought up the topic of
open source because, for example, I would say that hasura. Not hasura, that's super base. It's
not really a copy of of Firebase because Firebase, it's a closed source source and super base at
least in the, in the, in the, what it was at the beginning, it's an open source alternative.
00:16:10:20 - 00:16:56:15
Jens
The same thing with, cal.com and calendly the the thing is, if you think about like, like
copycatting or in this kind of negative way, well, one thing, it's just like a post that came up
yesterday after after, Apollo said like, hey, our, our router is now version 2.0. It's now GA one of
the first messages they got on on Reddit as a comment was, yes, but what if a company wants
to to self host, this this router and it doesn't want the, the, the router to call to an online service
because of, of regulations or other reasons.
00:16:56:18 - 00:17:28:18
Jens
And so if you built, like a Federation tool suite and the router is open source, it's apache2
licensed and it can work air gapped, that's it. That's a complete differentiator. Like yes, we're
doing federation. But one thing like graph OS, if you do subscriptions, for example, what I
consider like, like GraphQL subscriptions, it's a base functionality.
00:17:28:21 - 00:17:54:00
Jens
It's not an enterprise feature. Like if you put this behind an enterprise wall and then someone
comes along and builds an open source router and makes that just open source, that's not
copying because it's it's a completely different thing. Like one business model, like, yes, on the
technical side, it's it's it's very much the same thing. But on the business side, it's just two very
different approaches.
00:17:54:00 - 00:18:18:18
Jens
And for example, this is, this is one thing I would say it's, it's about philosophy. Sometimes for
us, one of the, one of the key parts, of, of our philosophy is that, actually, I know we we talk. We
talk. Yeah. Okay. We we can, we can transition into into topic two. I know you have this other
question.
00:18:18:18 - 00:18:57:04
Jens
We can go back. But for us, one of the key parts in our philosophy is infrastructure, architecture,
infrastructure components. They must be open source. So the router must be open source. And
there must be no feature in the router that needs an enterprise license or that needs to talk to an
external service or some something. Because if we want to own this federation market, then
everybody should see wundergraph Cosmo router as like the default solution.
00:18:57:11 - 00:19:21:02
Jens
And so, how do you make the, how do you make this as frictionless as possible? Don't put
roadblocks in front of people that prevent them from using the router. And so I don't know if you
deploy the router in your data center and like, you know, we have Cosmo Managed Cloud and
blah, blah, blah. And like this is what we're selling.
00:19:21:02 - 00:19:49:27
Jens
We're not selling an open source router. This is just an open source router. Do whatever you
want. If you don't need anything from us, if you don't care about us, this is fine. Deploy your
router. You leave us alone. We leave you alone. It's open source. Do whatever. But we want the
community to use this thing because we believe if more people use the router, it will be a better
router.
00:19:49:27 - 00:20:15:18
Jens
So if more people use subscriptions, we can find the bugs and we can make it better and we
can make it faster and correct and everything. And so if you put an enterprise license on top of
your infrastructure component, it just means you're now reducing, the possibility that more
people can use it. So less people use it.
00:20:15:18 - 00:20:39:12
Jens
Less people tell you about bugs and you're not improving it. And we want to have the best
router. So how do you get the best router. Make it free. Let's everybody use it. And the you know
the the business model is not like selling a license for a router. Because honestly, I don't believe
that anybody wants to pay license fees for a router.
00:20:39:12 - 00:21:04:00
Jens
You know, look at engine X. Sorry to go on the on the rant, but look at engine X, engine X, it's at
the very beginning. It was the most amazing thing. Like it powered so many websites. Then they
got investment. And the investors obviously they want to have a return on invest. Like hence the
name investors.
00:21:04:02 - 00:21:26:05
Jens
So they created like I don't know, engine X plus or some other weird things. And nobody wants
this. Like I just want to deploy engine X like leave me alone. I don't want extra. I also don't want
license because like, I don't like it. So I don't know. Our our philosophy is just yeah, everybody
just use the router.
00:21:26:05 - 00:21:45:15
Jens
If you don't want to buy our cloud it's it's fine. Then we need to think as a company. Why is it not
better? Why are we not providing value. And but that's our problem. That's not your problem. So
yeah, that's my my mini rant. Making ingfa components enterprises.
00:21:45:18 - 00:22:06:24
Stefan
There's a lot to unpack there, if you remember. So I did a conference talk at, API Days Austin,
and it was about the importance of open source. And when I was preparing for that talk, a lot of
the research that I was doing was on the history of open source. And when the first, like,
software was kind of issued, it wasn't like licensed.
00:22:06:24 - 00:22:27:12
Stefan
It was source code. You would pay for the source code. And then somebody was like, we should
license it out. Like, I will pay you to get the license to get the source code. And then came open
source. And this happened because big enterprises like IBM were like, oh my God, we can
make so much money by putting a license behind our source code and then licensing it out for
companies to use.
00:22:27:14 - 00:22:50:19
Stefan
And then came the, the Apache web server and came a bunch of other open source tooling, and
it completely destroyed that model. And so we went through this cycle that was like source
code, open source. That's not going to work with the source code anymore. And then we went
back and then we started with SaaS. And if you remember from like 2005 I would say to 2015
like ten years SaaS was dominating.
00:22:50:19 - 00:23:08:14
Stefan
There was absolutely dominating us. Open source kind of took a step back. And then 2015 to
2020, open source started making a comeback. And what I'm trying to bring home is one, if you
ever want to learn about anything, learn about the history, because you can start to see trends
that happen in the future, because history tends to repeat itself.
00:23:08:14 - 00:23:31:23
Stefan
It's fantastic. And two, it's happening right now. Mark Zuckerberg released, the their llm model
llama as open source. And what he said is that LLMS need to be open source, and it's not to
compete with open AI. It's not to use it as a marketing funnel. Because fundamentally, if you
want to win in this game, you can't have proprietary stuff on people's data centers.
00:23:31:29 - 00:23:53:28
Stefan
You can't have proprietary stuff in their infrastructure. They want open source. And what's great
about that is that when open source is used in the correct way, you're not just in one data
center, you're in thousands. You have thousands of use cases, thousands of experiences,
thousands of industries. You're not limiting yourself to one data center with one license.
00:23:53:28 - 00:24:14:13
Stefan
You're all over. You've created this moat of information, which is absolutely fantastic. And I think
you're absolutely right. And we talk about this a lot. So explain to me, like what you told me all
the time about with like Monday.com, with Miro, with collaboration. And they don't do anything
with infrastructure, but they make $3 billion a year. Where, where is the emphasis in
companies?
00:24:14:13 - 00:24:19:02
Stefan
What do they actually want to solve?
00:24:19:05 - 00:24:52:23
Jens
So the the way we think is there's, there's like two, there's like 2 or 2 ways to, to, to think about,
the, to think about components. So you have one area of components. We, we consider this
infrastructure infrastructure for example. It's a database. It's Postgres. It's it's S3, it's cosmo
router like a router engine X, these kind of components.
00:24:52:25 - 00:25:31:00
Jens
And then there's software for collaboration, for example Jira, linear, slack, etc. like, all these
collaboration things like GitHub, there's people, they work together. It can be all sorts of people
like technical, non-technical product owners, etc.. And then on the infra side, you have these
components and that for, for us, the I would say one one, one big observation from the market is
collaborative tools.
00:25:31:03 - 00:25:54:27
Jens
People want to use them and they want to collaborate. And infrastructure tools like a router,
people want to own them. They want to have control. It's about trust. It's in our data center, in
our VPN. It's it's in our VPC. It's it's our data. We want to control it. We want to customize it. We
want to own it.
00:25:54:27 - 00:26:31:00
Jens
And so, there's also a component to, data volume. So for example in these collaborative tools
like JIRA or linear or whatever, if you have 100 devs working and you have, you have not so
much success yet as a company, you pay for this 100 devs. But if you then build a very
successful product and you scale it out and you're still 100 people, you pay the same amount.
00:26:31:03 - 00:27:01:27
Jens
So the cost on collaboration, it doesn't correlate with your success. And then if you look at infra
in the, on the infrastructure side, if you have no users, the cost of your infrastructure is is not
zero, but it's kind of low. Like you need a database, even if it's empty. And if you scale up, if you
are more and more successful, your infrastructure bill, it can skyrocket.

And the big problem here is if you have middlemen in the infrastructure layer, that puts a huge
margin on top of on top of compute. That is that is driving up your cost. And so what we see is
that, like the most expensive asset in your company, it's your it's your people like the, the, the
HR cost.
00:27:30:06 - 00:27:58:15
Jens
And because they are so expensive, you want to give them powerful tools for collaboration so
that they as a team can scale and they can work together very well versus on the infrastructure
side, the goal of the company is always to drive down the infra cost. And simply put, it is very
hard to do this. If you have this like these wrappers or however you want to call them.
00:27:58:21 - 00:28:30:21
Jens
Like for example, you know, there was like, in the past there were, big discussions, for example,
around vercel. But if you now look closely, what Vercel is doing, just recently they announced
this fluid compute thing, and the goal is to drive down the infra cost, because also, Vercel has
probably recognized that people who scale they want to do it in an efficient way.
00:28:30:23 - 00:29:01:12
Jens
So the goal for infra is to drive down the cost. And the goal for collaboration is to enable more
collaboration. And because collaboration, it doesn't scale with with traffic and users, it's okay to,
to pay, a decent amount for that. So what is this, takeaway for us? First of all, router must be
open source. It must be self hostable without extra license cost.
00:29:01:15 - 00:29:32:26
Jens
And the goal for router must be to make it cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. So if people have
high traffic, our goal is to drive down the cost of that. And at the same time, on the collaboration
side, our goal is to enable teams to better collaborate. And I think that is very much in line with
the value perception from the from our, our users, our customers.
00:29:32:29 - 00:30:07:15
Jens
And I think as a, as a, as a startup, what is very important, if you think about these two buckets
where you can map out your market in other ways. But in our case, if you think about these,
these two buckets, infra and collaboration, you really want to align your revenue with the value
perception of your customer in a way that, if if we make a lot of money, I really want our
customers to get a lot of value because otherwise we get like this asynchronous situation.
00:30:07:15 - 00:30:33:23
Jens
That's for example, a lot of people feel with Apollo, you, you have the, your enterprise account.
And the moment you, you scale up your traffic, everybody gets scared because the infra bill is,
is so high. But the point is, it doesn't need to be that high. Like this is margin. And the the
question is, is it should it be like that?
00:30:33:23 - 00:30:43:16
Jens
Is it is it really aligned with, with the customer value? And we think it's not.
00:30:43:18 - 00:31:19:25
Stefan
I mean, on episode three, I talked with Dustin about this, which was it was it came from a
conversation with Dax. So for those of you that are, Dax, he's working at SST, which helps you
deploy on to AWS. And one of the things that we were discussing is that eventually, any
company that builds on top of a cloud, whatever their margin is, they're going to have to drive
that price down to be almost the same as Apollo, or to be the same as AWS or whatever cloud
that they're on, because it's what you said when a company scales, they're going to look at the
product and be like, this is on top
00:31:19:25 - 00:31:41:10
Stefan
of another cloud. Why is there so much margin on top of that? And if you look ahead like how
we are and you're saying, okay, well, how can we drive down the price of infra and increase
more collaboration? That's where you want to be. And I really like the you brought up vercel
because in the past two years they were really struggling with people being upset, like, wow, my
costs skyrocketed.
00:31:41:10 - 00:32:04:10
Stefan
Why? This is just a wrapper on top of AWS and Guillermo. To his credit, he realized that and he
said, let's drive down the cost of let's increase the collaboration feature, let's increase V0, let's
focus more on building with collaboration, because he saw ahead, and I think we saw that a little
bit earlier, like 2 or 3 years ago when we started, Cosmo was, hey, the value is never in the
collaboration.
00:32:04:10 - 00:32:06:25
Stefan
It's always going to be a race down to zero because you're on.
00:32:06:25 - 00:32:11:12
Jens
Top of your set. The value is not in collaboration. The value is not an infra.
00:32:11:14 - 00:32:31:09
Stefan
Yes, correct. The value is not in infra because that cost is always going to go down to zero. And
for me I it's but in hindsight it seems so obvious. Like I don't understand like, you know for me
like how some companies don't realize this. You can never compete against AWS. Their
margins will be crazy low always.
00:32:31:11 - 00:33:09:25
Jens
You know, let me be very specific why Cosmo is open source. So let's do some game theory.
So, Apollo, it's closed source. And if you're unlucky, that can result in, in a very high infra bill
eventually, because you have billions of requests, eventually it gets super expensive. It gets
more and more and more expensive, to the point where you start thinking about, could we do it
on our own?
00:33:09:27 - 00:33:34:23
Jens
Could we build our own gateway? And a lot of smaller companies will be hesitant to do that.
Luckily, they don't have so much traffic, so they kind of bite the bullet and they are like, yeah,
okay, we we are unhappy and it harms the relationship actually. But they bite the bullet okay. But
then there's hyperscalers like Faang companies who also do federation.
00:33:34:25 - 00:34:02:11
Jens
And they can they can staff a whole team and say, you know, it's it doesn't make sense. We're
not paying millions for a SaaS when we host the router in our infra. So what do they do. They
build a team and they build their own router. And if they have good policies in the company if, if,
if it's allowed, they make this router open source.
00:34:02:13 - 00:34:28:19
Jens
So now you have an open source router backed by a Faang company. And so we were thinking
okay before that happens, should we not be the ones who built the foundation, the open source
router and the Faang companies can use it and extend it if we're doing it right, maybe they
collaborate with us. And this is actually behind the scenes.
