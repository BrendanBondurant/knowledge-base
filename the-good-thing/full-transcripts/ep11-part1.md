Episode 11
00:00:24:18 - 00:00:53:18
Stefan
And we're live. Welcome back, everybody, to another episode of the Good Thing podcast,
hosted by me, Stefan, and joined by my co-host Jens. Excuse me for a little bit. I'm a little bit
tired because yesterday was a huge day for us at wundergraph . So you might have seen the
news, but we finally announced our series A funding, which was led by Karma Ventures and
then with a strategic follow on from eBay ventures and then our existing investors continuing
their investment in us with AspenWood Ventures.
00:00:53:18 - 00:01:09:09
Stefan
But amazing news, we're super excited about that. Today we're going to talk about why we took
the funding, building the future of API collaboration, and everything that it means to us. But
before that, I told you that I would do this a little bit of a celebration on our end.
00:01:10:21 - 00:01:24:12
Stefan
So good. If you guys watch some old episodes that we used to post from like, WunderGraph
Show and Tell, we used to use that horn a lot, which was awesome. But, yeah, Jens. I mean,
welcome back. It's it's kind of weird now because we did it in person last week, which was a bit
more fun in my opinion.
00:01:24:14 - 00:01:29:26
Stefan
But yeah. Any thoughts on the series A, Anything you want to tell the crowd?
00:01:29:29 - 00:01:35:10
Jens
It's funny you say it was exhausting because what did you do yesterday?
00:01:35:12 - 00:01:49:23
Stefan
It was exhausting. I had to reply to everyone's LinkedIn message. Thank you, thank you. You
know, old friends were coming into my Instagram like, hey, how are you? Good to see you and
things like that. So very tiring.
00:01:49:25 - 00:02:35:06
Jens
Yeah. No, I mean, I don't know from, from my perspective, it's it's much less about the, raising
the money and much more about what it actually means to raise the money. All the work that
went into this, before, so that that was, I would say a huge undertaking. And it's also super
weird. And I'm actually happy that we that we now have this out because, yeah, for a very long
time, we couldn't talk about it, and we, we couldn't talk about, that, that we were able to to,
00:02:35:09 - 00:03:01:07
Jens
Yeah. Turn the ship around and we, we couldn't talk about, the ups and downs and everything,
and, it's also, you know, I, I would love to be more transparent as a founder, but how transparent
can you be about struggling after a seed round and things not working out? And, yeah, you want
you want to to show confidence.
00:03:01:07 - 00:03:20:27
Jens
You want to be able to to tell people like, hey, it's it's working you you can rely on on what we're
doing. And, yeah, I think last year was was very hard, especially in the beginning. And then we
started turning it around and, yeah. Now, now we're here.
00:03:21:00 - 00:03:49:04
Stefan
Yeah. Well, so and I think an important thing is that people see funding rounds and it's like, wow,
amazing. And I don't see them that way. I actually see them as completely differently. And, Gary
Tan from, Y Combinator, like, I think he's the president CEO now. He says when you get a new
funding round, you don't pop champagne, you pour yourself a little glass of wine, and then you
get right back into it the next day, only on exits, or if you get acquired or if you IPO, that's when
you really pop the champagne.
00:03:49:04 - 00:04:04:18
Stefan
And so I fully agree with you. Like the money is cool, the press is cool. But what it really means
is, hey, now we can accelerate our mission. And that's what matters. And what we always talk
about. Our customers. How how can we use this money to benefit our customers more? What
do you think about that?
00:04:04:21 - 00:04:37:14
Jens
You said the money is cool. I don't think the money is cool. I think the money is money. And it's
not even our money. Okay? It's now in the company, so it's a tool. Okay, so the company has
customers and it has revenue and it has products. And with the money, we can we can
essentially build more product faster than we could do if we bootstrapped.
00:04:37:16 - 00:05:02:24
Jens
Which also leads a bit to the question of why are you even. You know, it was funny, like we did
this announcement video of, and you mentioned like, hey, why why are we diluting our shares?
Because, yeah, that's that's true. You know, every, every funding announcement, it should
actually be like, hey, we have diluted our shares. yipee
00:05:03:00 - 00:05:28:00
Jens
What's what's so cool about that. And from I think from a founder perspective, if you want to
take funding, you have to ask yourself the question, is it worth diluting? What do I get for it? And
for example, in our situation, I think with the current market climate, there's so much going on.
00:05:28:00 - 00:06:00:22
Jens
There's AI, there's federation, there's, you know, other players with with, huge market shares.
There's innovation that could happen theres, investments we could make. But if we do all of this
in a bootstrapped way, we we can we we have to operate at a different pace. And I think from
our perspective, I can I can speak for, for all founders.
00:06:00:22 - 00:06:32:20
Jens
It was clear that this year has a lot of opportunities we wouldn't be able to take without
additional funding because we yeah, we we couldn't go as fast as we want. And yeah, like if you
if you want to handle enterprise customers right. You have to have certain certain things in
place. And yeah. So, I don't think it was like such a tough decision to make it.
00:06:32:25 - 00:06:59:13
Jens
It was more like, yeah, I think it's it's the right time. And then eBay came along. EBay is is pretty
cool because, I wrote about this in the blog post in our announcement and they, they help us a
lot. Like if you are a startup and you're building something for enterprise, it is worth a lot.
00:06:59:13 - 00:07:27:21
Jens
If you can have a design partner who who helps you understand how enterprise works, what
kind of integration points you need? For, for metrics and other things. And, so, yeah, it's, it's, I
think it's a very helpful thing. And then also the brand, in terms of, what it means, if you can put
on your landing page that, that such a big companies, is not just a customer but also an
investor.
00:07:27:21 - 00:07:49:17
Jens
I think that that also means something. Yeah. So and I think in general, it, it, it has a meaning
that a public company is betting on us. It speaks for the relationship we have built with the
people. I don't know, what else would you add?
00:07:49:19 - 00:08:08:02
Stefan
There's a lot that you said there. I mean, there's a lot to unpack. David saying that we were late.
Yes, this is true. We were a little bit late, but sorry about that. But, I mean, there's a lot to unpack
with funding like, I totally agree with you. Like, you should really when you're building a
company, you should really understand why you want to take funding.
00:08:08:08 - 00:08:22:12
Stefan
Do you want to move faster? Do you want to build a lifestyle business? Do you want to IPO
eventually? Like what is your goal as a founder? And I think a lot of founders skip that and they
go, oh, I need to raise money. But like, why do you need to raise money? Like, why do you need
to do this?
00:08:22:12 - 00:08:41:02
Stefan
Why do you want to dilute your shares? There's great companies out there that do great in
revenue. And it's a sole owner. He he owns 100% of the company. He bootstrapped it from the
beginning. It might have taken him longer. And also it's important to understand investors. So
investors want to give you money because they want to see a return in about ten years.
00:08:41:04 - 00:08:56:26
Stefan
And theres is it's go really fast or hit the ground and burn and then go to the next one. And a lot
of people understand is that investors really just care about the power law, is that one company
in their portfolio will return the whole fund. Their goal is just to find that one company. Other
funds are different.
00:08:56:26 - 00:09:14:05
Stefan
There are some funds that really don't care about that, and they make strategic bets and they
act more like like I would say, like, I don't know, like, strategic bank, you know, they're making
good bets. Small acquisition here. So I think it definitely as a founder, you you want to
understand why you want to take funding. And then I talk about this a lot with my friends.
00:09:14:05 - 00:09:46:06
Stefan
They're like, oh, like funding must be amazing. It must be amazing. And it's like, it's cool. But
again, it's just a tool, like you're just using the money and it also adds a lot of headache on it. If
you remember the guy, Park Conrad, he's the founder of rippling. He says fundraising is actually
the easiest part about building a company, because you go and you do these pitches and it's
annoying and people complain like, oh my God, I've pitched a thousand times, or I've pitched
5000 times, but if you go and you build a real company, that's actually the easiest part, because
the hardest part is once you get the money is like, oh
00:09:46:06 - 00:10:00:14
Stefan
shit. So now I have to execute. And Jens, I want to talk a little bit about this. Like, I mean, we
were we were pretty frustrated when we were raising for the series A, not because we weren't
getting traction, but because we just wanted to go back and work with the customers and focus
on the stuff that matters.
00:10:00:21 - 00:10:17:24
Stefan
Like, this is important, yes, but what are your thoughts on that? Do you remember, like in
December when we we had to go to we went to Tallinn. We got to meet our amazing lead
investors, karma. And then we went to London in five days. We went to six countries, I think,
and we were just exploring and just talking to VCs and that whole time we could have been with
customers.
00:10:17:24 - 00:10:29:21
Stefan
But like talk to me a little bit about that. Like the balance of going and having to raise money and
putting on your fundraising hat and then also having to delegate, you know, like your customers
and things like that.
00:10:29:23 - 00:10:48:05
Jens
I mean, ideally you don't have to raise, and I think you can also very much lose yourself in, in
the fundraising game. And also you can you can. Are you laughing.
00:10:48:08 - 00:10:49:17
Stefan
No, no,just my chair.
00:10:49:19 - 00:11:22:00
Jens
Just a chair okay. You know, the the thing is, you can try to find validation in what VCs say, and
this can be extremely dangerous. VCs are not your customers. And, yeah, I don't know, but it's
super weird. But when we raised our series seed, I was I was super interested or I was really
trying to to get VCs to buy into what we're doing and to.
00:11:22:02 - 00:11:47:05
Jens
Yeah, to impress them and to be like, hey, we're we're innovative, blah, blah, blah. And at series
a. I don't know, I think really what, what matters is what what what kind of customer stories you
have. How what have you learned from customers? What do you see in the market. And you
you don't need confirmation from, from VCs.
00:11:47:07 - 00:12:13:29
Jens
So and by the way, one, one comment you made on, on VCs making, like, returning the fund,
there's different VCs. So some VCs want to return the fund, others have other models. So, and
this is also a thing fundraising is selling. You're you're you're selling a ticket on your ship. And,
this, this ship should find gold.
00:12:14:02 - 00:12:39:27
Jens
And, now you need to tell people why your ship is good. Like, how will it find gold and stuff like
that? And, so it's very much like selling. But the problem is you want to sell your product, and
that's actually a different product than selling a ticket on your ship. So it's, it's a huge distraction
because, you also have to sell differently.
00:12:39:27 - 00:13:04:26
Jens
Like, you know, your customers, they care about your features. VCs care about the features of
your ship. So why is your ship a good ship? Why? Why sail with you? Why not another ship? Is
your ship diesel engine? Is it, is it whatever electric. And how will it succeeded in very bad
waves and all this kind of stuff like.
00:13:04:29 - 00:13:30:00
Jens
And. Yeah. So I don't know fundraising this into I, you, you know, me, I very much like sales and
I like to understand what, what people want and I think, you know, you mentioned there's people
who have like hundreds of VC calls and stuff. I think you don't need hundreds of VC calls. What
you actually need is just like sales.
00:13:30:02 - 00:13:56:07
Jens
You need the process to vet VCs because it's like it's a it's about leads. So you should have a
lot of leads. You should have a good phone book, and you should figure out who understands
what you're doing because, you know, let's say you you build a ship and you want to sail it to
America, and you talk to people who don't understand America, and they don't want to go there.
00:13:56:10 - 00:14:19:19
Jens
You can tell them, hey, my ship is fast, but they don't want to go to America. Well, they don't
understand what you're trying to do. And so ideally, you can build a network of VCs around you
who are already aligned with with your direction. And so a lot of fundraising, it actually starts
months and years before raising like at seed stage.
00:14:19:19 - 00:14:40:15
Jens
For example. You have an idea, and then you, you do something and they, they don't give you
money, but they observe and then you, you keep them updated on your progress. You pivot,
okay. You tell them about it. And this is also an important thing. Like, there's nothing wrong with
pivoting like nobody cares if you pivot.
00:14:40:15 - 00:14:59:06
Jens
What people care about is, are you are you are you finding a way to gold. And so if you go the
wrong way and then you change course and you find something, then then tell that story
because it means, okay, now they have experienced, they have learned something. Okay. It's,
it's it's better to, to bet on them.
00:14:59:06 - 00:15:14:04
Jens
So. Yeah, that's that's a lot of nuance in fundraising. It's it's a fun game. But it's also a distraction
from building product and talking to customers, working with customers. So. Okay. Typical long
monologue.
00:15:14:06 - 00:15:16:09
Stefan
But it's well said though. I kinda like it.
00:15:16:10 - 00:15:19:20
Jens
Take your pick your part and rip it apart.
00:15:19:23 - 00:15:40:14
Stefan
Yeah. No, I mean I think it's important and like, especially for you like, I mean you didn't have
experience. I mean, none of us had experience with pitching to VCs, especially coming from a
pure technical background. But what I've learned about venture capital is, it's like so seed stage
is you're betting on the team, you're really just betting on the team.
00:15:40:16 - 00:15:57:28
Stefan
The product might be amazing, but especially if they're first time founders, you're betting and
saying, hey, can this group of guys or girls or whatever this group is, can they execute and build
this into $1 billion company series a though is a little bit different series a is a little bit more
serious. And it's like, hey, okay, they built this part out.
00:15:58:05 - 00:16:18:05
Stefan
We're still betting on the team, but now we're betting on the product. We're betting on the
market. How big is this actual market? How fast can they grow? I agree with everything that
you've said. One thing though, that they don't talk about with, VCs is how lucky we are to have
someone like Bjorn. So Bjorn is somebody that keeps the relationships year round with
investors.
00:16:18:05 - 00:16:37:09
Stefan
He keeps them updated and a lot of people drop that ball if they if one of the founders isn't
doing it and people, you know, they misunderstand, they think, oh, like I'm not sending emails to
investors, but just because they don't invest now doesn't mean that they won't invest later. And
it's important, what jens said. Keep this relationship and this circle around you.
00:16:37:11 - 00:16:57:16
Stefan
But they should be what we call in sales. Your ICP, you know, people that understand you, they
understand the space that you're in and that they could potentially invest down the road. But
yeah, it's well-said. Regarding though, like the last question I have, on raising money, is that like
in the early days with the seed, like, what were some of the mistakes you made?
00:16:57:18 - 00:17:17:11
Stefan
I mean, there was the one with the zoom call that was pretty funny where you asked them to
call. Yeah. You remember when you asked the guy, can you turn on your to turn on your
camera? And he was like, no. And you're like, all right, let's end this meeting. That wasn't really
a mistake though now that I think about it, but what were some mistakes you made when we
were early in the early days when you were learning how to fundraise?
00:17:17:13 - 00:17:18:17
Stefan
00:17:18:19 - 00:17:47:16
Jens
I mean, it's natural, but I think early on I wanted to impress people. And just think about it. If you
know what you're doing and you know you have a ship to gold, do you have to impress people
or are you more like, good day, I have a ship to gold. Do you want a ticket? But, I have not so
many tickets like you.
00:17:47:17 - 00:18:09:19
Jens
You you need to be quick. So. And this is an attitude of, you know what you're doing, or are you
the kind of guy like, hey, I have this ship. It's amazing. Like, you really, really need to join. And
you, like, nobody's on the ship yet, but it will be a great ship. And so.
00:18:09:21 - 00:18:25:10
Jens
Yeah. Like, don't try to impress VCs, but this is hard in the beginning because you you feel like
you have to. And I think, I mean, the most important thing is.
00:18:25:13 - 00:18:53:03
Jens
I always get these calls. It's so annoying. Okay. So, I mean, the first step to becoming better at
pitching to VCs is you need to start pitching to VCs. So you, you you, it's it's not possible to, to
improve pitching if you don't do it. So step number one just pitch two VCs and don't think too
much over it.
00:18:53:10 - 00:19:19:07
Jens
And then there's this other thing. People obsess about pitch decks. And you, you find online like,
hey, here's the pitch deck, how a company blah blah blah raised whatever amount of money.
Okay? The pitch deck doesn't really matter. Like nobody cares. Like, okay, some people, at
some point they will look at the pitch deck, but um, you you need you need you really need one
slide.
00:19:19:12 - 00:19:47:24
Jens
This slide is we we have found gold. Here's how our revenue growth. If you have this slide, then
it's a done deal. And if you don't have the slide, you kind of need a whole back up deck that
somehow still convinces people. And that's really hard. Like so the reality is ideally bootstrap
your startup without funding get it in a place where the startup doesn't need money.
00:19:47:26 - 00:20:11:25
Jens
Okay, so, bootstrap to the place where it works and then have a good plan what you really
would do with the money, because it just it it really sucks if you go to VCs and you're like, please
give me 3 million. We don't know what we're doing. We need the money to build a team and
then we try to figure it out like that.
00:20:11:25 - 00:20:55:04
Jens
That's that doesn't sound like you're on the path to gold. It sounds more like, yeah, whatever.
And maybe you have a super good team, and maybe you can somehow convince people that
with this team, you can build something but I don't know if if I could do it again, build real
attraction and get somewhere and to be honest, I think if you, if you start a startup and you don't
have an experienced founder in the startup team, or at least as an advisor and not like, you
know, not an advisor from somewhere, but really like a friend or something who's a really good
advisor, who who went through the steps in the last
00:20:55:04 - 00:21:31:12
Jens
couple of years, I wouldn't even start a startup because I don't know if I compare my, my, my
ego, my my alter ego today to a few years ago. We were we were rookies. We had no no clue. It
was. It's ridiculous. We we achieved this. So get yourself someone who knows how to do it
because they. So if I would today talk to, first time founder with a few questions, I can destroy
them.
00:21:31:15 - 00:21:41:04
Jens
And just because they are not focused on the right things and they don't understand nothing,
and it's it's just so hard in the beginning to build a startup.
00:21:41:06 - 00:21:43:10
Stefan
I'd push back though on that, like.
00:21:43:13 - 00:21:52:27
Jens
Oh, I don't hear you anymore. Somehow I, I messed up my audio. It's not you. Can you hear it?
00:21:53:00 - 00:22:20:29
Stefan
So. While Jens is figuring out his audio. One of the things that I will say is fundraising. It's
interesting. Yes, it's an important. It is a bit of a distraction, but it is important. And what I
compare fundraising to is kind of like dating. Like with dating. It's interesting. The harder you try
to get the person, the less interested they are, the less interested that you play and the person
that doesn't really need the relationship ends up winning.
00:22:21:01 - 00:22:33:23
Stefan
And then obviously there's FOMO, you know, like as soon as you put the wedding ring on all the
girls, that didn't give you a chance, have they now start coming towards you because you have
a wedding ring and you're taken off the market. And so that's the way I put venture capitalism
and but can you hear me now?
00:22:33:23 - 00:22:34:04
Stefan
Yeah. Are you.
00:22:34:04 - 00:22:37:18
Jens
Good? Yeah. Hey, I also just dropped my ring, so.
00:22:37:21 - 00:23:01:00
Stefan
Yeah, that's that's how I figured. But I push back on that because you said, you know, like, find
an experienced founder. But like, if you look back at all the great companies, like, they might
have had a great, like, founder friend to help them out, like, you know, Mark Zuckerberg with
Peter Thiel and things like that. But I also think a core strength of first time founders is how
much they underestimate, like we underestimated a lot.
00:23:01:02 - 00:23:18:08
Stefan
And I think that's actually a strength, because if you really knew what you know now, you
wouldn't have started WunderGraph. You're like, if I had to go through everything to get to this
point where I'm at now, you would have been like, oh yeah, that that's no, not for me. And I think
also a lot of people
00:23:18:10 - 00:23:35:27
Stefan
Yeah. But like if you know, what do you actually have to go to to start a startup and like you see
all these shows glamorizing these entrepreneurs and everything. But if you talk to a real
founder, he will tell you how hard it is to start a company, how hard it is to go through all these
things and their strength is you actually don't know how hard it is.
00:23:36:00 - 00:23:55:28
Stefan
So I don't know. I would encourage people to try it, just know it's not going to be fun. It's not
going to be easy. It'll be really, really high highs. It'll be really low lows. But I think it's also a
strength of being a first time founder because if you have all the experience, you're experienced
enough to be like, this is this is going to be really tough.
00:23:56:01 - 00:23:58:10
Stefan
Would you agree or would you push back on that?
00:23:58:13 - 00:24:36:05
Jens
I agree and I disagree, so I, I, I would really appreciate if like could talk to me back then with my
ego now just because it could be so helpful at the same time. You wouldn't start many
companies if you had the experience. And I think one of one of the big benefits of, of a first time
founder is, they don't know what they don't know, and everybody thinks you cannot do it and
they don't know that.
00:24:36:08 - 00:25:03:13
Jens
So they just do it. Yeah. It that that's that's a that's a huge advantage. Also I don't know, but in
the beginning we built the wrong thing. We didn't know it was wrong. We just built the wrong
thing because we thought, that's right. We figured it out. But then later on we we figured out that
actually we always built the right thing, but at the wrong time.
00:25:03:16 - 00:25:27:00
Jens
So, I don't know. In the end, this is something that one one of my friends keeps telling me, hey,
Jens, you need to be careful with the products you're building. You're always, like, five years
ahead. And it's a it's such a difficult thing if you if you think you understand the market and then
you I don't know, I, I cannot sit still.
00:25:27:00 - 00:25:52:27
Jens
I always want to make something, something better. You know, I talk to customers and I'm like,
okay, this, this, this should be better. It should be different. But if you do it for a while, you kind of
accept that you have like a long term roadmap, you have a short term roadmap. And you you
kind of need to align and you somehow need to synchronize with the, with the, with the vibe of
the market.
00:25:53:00 - 00:26:09:01
Jens
So you can you can have ideas, about the, about what you, what you want to build and
everything. And, you need to sometimes you need to wait for the market to make the right move,
and, yeah.
00:26:09:01 - 00:26:30:22
Stefan
So I think, yeah, I think it's a great transition. One of the things I really want to talk about today
is like, okay, we got the funding. That's great, but what are we actually using it for? So you can
say all the generic stuff. We're going to hire people. We're going to expand this. But from the
product point of view I want to go into GraphQL like it's interesting and I'll be fully transparent.
00:26:30:22 - 00:26:41:08
Stefan
So we started Jens originally started wundergraph in 2020, and this was after he went to, I think.
Was it Apollo's conference? The original Apollo conference. He went to.
00:26:41:11 - 00:26:45:03
Jens
GraphQL summit in, I think 2019.
00:26:45:05 - 00:27:02:03
Stefan
So you went there and you had this idea of like this universal data layer you were still working
at, Tyk at the time, you really enjoyed it. And GraphQL was hot. Like, it was really hot. I
remember like even being like graduating from college, like this was something that they were
putting to the curriculum. And 2020, you started wundergraph, in 2022
00:27:02:03 - 00:27:22:07
Stefan
We raised the funds. We started working together, I mean, year 2021. But we've gone through
this crazy thing where at one time there were so many GraphQL companies, there were stepset
and there was a delay. There was, the guild, there was all these companies, and they were well-
funded. Fast forward to now, there's really just us and Apollo.
00:27:22:09 - 00:27:41:19
Stefan
But what happened with GraphQL like. And I'm going to play devil's advocate and you I'm going
to play the people on Reddit and Twitter and you tell me what you see because when I see
GraphQL, I actually don't see what they say on Reddit. In Twitter. Oh, GraphQL is dead.
Instead, I see, wow, GraphQL is growing. All these huge companies are using it.
00:27:41:23 - 00:27:56:28
Stefan
They're all going towards Federation. But I want you to play that part. But from a product point
of view, with the funding, where do you see GraphQL? Where do you see this market? And like
where do you think it's going? Especially in the next couple of years withAI.
00:27:57:00 - 00:27:59:21
Stefan
I know a lot to unpack.
00:27:59:23 - 00:28:22:29
Jens
Okay. I don't want to start with GraphQL, by the way. This is not staged. We're just yeah, I, I'm
not prepared. But if we zoom out a little bit and I this morning I had, I had a cool conversation
with, Eric Wilde from I think, you know, or, INNOQ or something. He he's an API expert, like.
00:28:23:02 - 00:28:30:29
Stefan
Eric Wilde from. He works,. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
00:28:31:00 - 00:28:49:06
Jens
He's like a API catalyst, But he goes into companies and he consults and helps people with API
strategy, governance, everything. Okay. So we had a conversation and it it started with MCP of
course. Yes MCP sure. Model context protocol.
00:28:49:08 - 00:28:55:00
Stefan
real quick, can you explain MCP like for maybe those don't really understand it.
00:28:55:03 - 00:29:09:16
Jens
Yeah. So, I have an API for you. So, so, so that LLMS can talk to APIs. I put an API around the
API so LLM can talk to the API.
00:29:09:18 - 00:29:13:21
Stefan
Okay. Well, problem does that solve. So what does that actually do?
00:29:13:24 - 00:29:46:13
Jens
Yeah, that's that's weird. So we have APIs in the world like REST, GraphQL, whatever.
Somehow people were like, okay, LLM could talk to them, but that would be too simple. So we,
we we we now say let's click create kind of like something that is similar to open API, which talks
over Json RPC, and it defines functions that LLM could call and we call it MCP.
00:29:46:15 - 00:30:13:19
Jens
So it's kind of like okay we we define RPC with Json RPC and we create open API. And now
LLM can talk to the thing and yeah. So so that's MCP. This is where this discussion started
okay. So yeah, we were we were talking about this topic and what we came down to is this kind
of like it's it's interesting.
00:30:13:19 - 00:30:39:18
Jens
But in the, in the API ecosystem, I would say there's three ways of, of using and interacting with
this APIs. So you have open API which allows you to describe your Rest API. And kind of people
figured out that nobody likes to directly use open API. So what people did is they built like there
is many startups now doing it.
00:30:39:18 - 00:31:12:03
Jens
They generate SDKs from open API specifications because people like to have classes or
structs or whatever to call APIs. Okay, so the way humans use APIs is through SDKs. If you
take an open API spec and you annotate it a little bit more with other stuff, you could turn that
into MCP and you obviously you have to talk over over Json RPC.
00:31:12:06 - 00:31:51:27
Jens
So that means you have two categories. You have one category, where we're doing APIs for
humans with SDK s. Then we're doing APIs for, for LLMs and we do it with MCP. And then we
have APIs for a diverse set of, of applications. And we're doing it with GraphQL. So we have a
query interface. And the funny part is how eric wilde was like he wasn't mentioning GraphQL,
but he started with like, yeah, if you don't care about Http and you just want to call classes, then
use SDK s.
00:31:51:29 - 00:32:20:27
Jens
If you don't care about Http, and you're an AI use MCP. And then I was like, yeah, and if you
don't care about Http and you want to have a query interface then GraphQL okay. So I would
describe the current state of the API ecosystem is we have these three categories. We have
SDKs, we have MCP and we have query interface query interface GraphQL.
00:32:20:27 - 00:32:52:17
Jens
It means we have we have a GraphQL API. And we have many clients and they many web
clients, no mobile clients. And they use this API in different ways. So instead of creating one
backend for front end per front end app, you, we have GraphQL. Okay. Now every frontend can
create this thing. And then there's this other, the other side where I think the whole REST
ecosystem, they kind of have it wrong.
00:32:52:19 - 00:33:16:04
Jens
Most people these days use GraphQL not because they want to have the query interface. That's
a cool benefit, but actually because they they want to have the federation. So they they
distribute the implementation of the API across multiple services, which can be which can be
distributed across different teams. And so.
00:33:16:07 - 00:33:17:07
Stefan
Question. Yeah.
00:33:17:10 - 00:33:18:03
Jens
Yeah.
00:33:18:05 - 00:33:31:17
Stefan
Do you think everyone that's using GraphQL will eventually go into Federation. Is that what
you're trying to say there. Like the real benefit is federation. What do you mean by that.
00:33:31:19 - 00:33:34:14
Jens
So.
00:33:34:16 - 00:34:03:00
Jens
You know, a long time ago I stopped pitching, I stopped pitching GraphQL. Yeah. Because.
Yeah, you can, you can, like, I still think it's it's the best way to have multiple apps with different
requirements. And it's, it's great that you have queries and fragments and it makes a lot of
sense. But I, I kind of cool down a bit on, on being like too enthusiastic.
00:34:03:00 - 00:34:33:03
Jens
about GraphQL on the front end side. That being said, on the back end side with Federation, I
think as a, as a lot of larger organization, you, you have to think about, how do you build your
microservice architecture or do you build a microservice architecture at all? But I mean, if you
want to to scale an engineering team, you it's typically very hard to have just one single
monolith.
00:34:33:06 - 00:34:51:09
Jens
And so, yeah, maybe you want to have one service per team, or at least, I don't know, one, 2 or
3 like a handful of services per team, but one service per team could, could be good. And so
let's say you have 20 teams, so you could have 20 subgraphs or more. Maybe you have a few
more.
00:34:51:09 - 00:35:26:14
Jens
Let's say, you are 20 teams and you have 30 subgraphs. If you don't have this federation thing,
what you will have is you have this gRPC thing. So each team has, I don't know, five gRPC
services. So you have 100 gRPC services and gRPC. It's not easy to consume from from the
web. It's not easy to consume from mobile apps, which also means you don't want to consume
100 gRPC services from mobile and web.
00:35:26:17 - 00:35:55:24
Jens
It's it's a complicated architecture. So what can you do? You can build Rest APIs on top BFF
style, or you can build, a unified graph on top. And this is where Federation comes into play. And
now you have to ask yourself the question, like the question I ask myself many years ago, and
when I was working for a big News Corp, do we invent our own federation algorithm?
00:35:55:26 - 00:36:28:19
Jens
Do we do we touch our Rest API middleware layer all the time? When we change
microservices, or can we rely on the framework that federates? And so I don't know these days
why why would you invent your own federation like and up that you know federation can mean
that I updat a microservice gRPC. And then I go to another repository with the Rest APIs, and I
update the client and add the fields to the REST API and so on, so forth.
