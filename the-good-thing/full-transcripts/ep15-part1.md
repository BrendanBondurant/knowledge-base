Episode 15
type: podcast-chunk
00:00:23:26 - 00:00:33:12
Stefan
And we're back. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing.
My name is Stefan. I'm joined by my co-host, Jens. Jens How are you doing today?
00:00:33:15 - 00:00:37:19
Jens
I'm good, I'm good. I would say rather normal.
00:00:37:22 - 00:00:44:24
Stefan
No. Not bad. How do Germans say they're having a great day? Yeah, exactly. Germans say
theyre having a good day by saying it's not bad.
00:00:44:27 - 00:00:50:06
Jens
Yeah. Did you see the landing page from. From sentry?
00:00:50:09 - 00:00:53:12
Stefan
Is it new, what did they add?
00:00:53:12 - 00:01:12:19
Jens
You know what we could do today? Just as a fun thing. Because, just for the audience, we're
currently heavily thinking about the topic of, landing pages. Can you bring up the, the landing
page? We can go through some landing pages, and we can. We can discuss them if they are
good landing pages, if you like.
00:01:12:21 - 00:01:14:17
Stefan
Yeah, I like that. Okay. One sec. I mean.
00:01:14:24 - 00:01:25:13
Jens
Stefan and I, we haven't planned this. I just had this idea because this, this morning I was going
through some landing pages to to to see what's going on, and,
00:01:25:15 - 00:01:25:29
Stefan
Let's start with.
00:01:25:29 - 00:01:33:26
Jens
Sentry. Yeah. Reload it. Because I think it's so cool. Oh, that's so cool.
00:01:33:26 - 00:01:35:01
Stefan
Awesome.
00:01:35:03 - 00:01:42:21
Jens
Yeah. Okay. Go back up. Code breaks. Fix it faster.
00:01:42:23 - 00:01:43:07
Stefan
Look at this.
00:01:43:07 - 00:01:54:18
Jens
Application monitoring software considered. Not bad by 4 million developers. So I'm wondering,
is sentry only used in Germany?
00:01:54:20 - 00:02:13:20
Stefan
No, this is actually quite good. Like, it's kind of weird. We've been we've been doing so much
research on landing pages and they all typically are very similar. Big hero subtext two buttons.
Try for free or explore the documentation and then kind of like a diagram or something that
works. But this is really creative right here, by the way.
00:02:13:20 - 00:02:17:17
Stefan
You see how it's like when you hover over it, you fix the code.
00:02:17:20 - 00:02:53:17
Jens
Yeah, that's funny, but you know, the, the like one thing I was wondering about, about landing
pages is so you have a call to action right at the beginning. You have try sentry for free, and you
have explorer, the sandbox. So I'm just wondering if you read the hero, are you already in a
state where you would like to try sentry for free, or is it not like, wouldn't the next logical step to
be to to explore the page more?
00:02:53:17 - 00:02:55:22
Jens
Or how do you think about it?
00:02:55:24 - 00:03:22:16
Stefan
Yeah, for me, whenever I'm like looking for a new solution, like obviously I take a look here first
and then I start to scroll down. And so here right away they have the trust. So I'm like, okay,
wow. GitHub, Disney, Atlassian, slack, Lyft, Instacart, Cloudflare, cursor. They all use sentry. You
know what's funny though about here being cursor is they have Disney and Atlassian and all
Microsoft with cursor like cursor is exploding.
00:03:22:16 - 00:03:35:19
Stefan
People are putting it on their logo wall if they can. That's insane. Yeah, but here the trust is
important. But this is where it kind of tells you what it does. This is where I'm figuring out, okay,
is this what I need? What do you think about it?
00:03:35:21 - 00:03:49:13
Jens
So I was looking at the at the designs and, illustrations of of sentry and I'm just wondering, like, I
don't know if for me, it's too playful.
00:03:49:15 - 00:03:50:06
Stefan
00:03:50:08 - 00:04:00:29
Jens
For for something that finds bugs. I'm not sure I, I think it's too playful, but it's it's taste. Probably.
What what's your what's your opinion?
00:04:01:01 - 00:04:21:18
Stefan
Well, it's right here. I think who they're appealing to is developers and developers are a little bit
like on Easter eggs. Quirky. And they like to be playful with stuff like this. That's why they put the
not bad. That's the way I read it as. And then here when they're talking about the important stuff
tracing, code coverage, session replay, air monitoring.
00:04:21:20 - 00:04:28:28
Stefan
This is very geared towards developers. So I think that's why they're kind of going the playful
angle. What do you think.
00:04:29:01 - 00:04:52:00
Jens
So in this view I think there's too much going on. I I don't know somehow I'm, I'm, I try to focus
on this fire thing. I'm not even seeing immediately the, the stuff outside. So I'm not sure how
good that page actually is. Yeah. Like, obviously it's it's made by people who are super
professionals and it's probably better than everything I could build.
00:04:52:00 - 00:05:03:25
Jens
But yeah, we can we can later look at our let's roast our landing page at the end, because our
landing page is also it has many flaws. But first, let's roast other people, right?
00:05:03:27 - 00:05:21:09
Stefan
Yeah. We can roast it and and praise it though. So I do love the design. I love the 3D aspect of
it. It does have that playfulness. So thingamajig doohickey whatchamacallit call it, but then it
starts to break. So it gives you the four biggest use cases air monitoring session, gameplay,
code coverage and tracing. And then it starts to go into them.
00:05:21:09 - 00:05:31:18
Stefan
So now I think this is towards the business. Prioritize what matters. Try triage issues based on
impacted customers. That's pretty useful.
00:05:31:21 - 00:05:45:03
Jens
Does sentry have measurable improvements like does it somewhere say like some KPIs? Can
you can you search a bit for like improvements or something?
00:05:45:05 - 00:06:01:01
Stefan
So here's the improvement of critical issues. But like poor performing API calls or data base
query's is too small. Yeah, there's not one that says like right here. Sorry for the developers,
more custom,
00:06:01:04 - 00:06:06:25
Jens
Social proof, social proof, trust compliance updates.
00:06:06:26 - 00:06:08:09
Stefan
Yeah, you're right, it actually doesnâ€™t.
00:06:08:09 - 00:06:20:12
Jens
something.
I think like what's missing is like 40% less bugs or faster improvements or, I don't know,
00:06:20:14 - 00:06:27:02
Stefan
What's crazy though, as they do over 100 million in revenue, I think they're very geared towards
the developer. First.
00:06:27:04 - 00:06:31:27
Jens
Yep. Let let's take a look at Prisma.
00:06:31:29 - 00:06:34:05
Stefan
Oh my god I'm going to roast. I'm going to roast.
00:06:34:08 - 00:06:37:12
Jens
My God.
00:06:37:15 - 00:06:44:28
Stefan
anymore.
I don't know, we should do Prisma because I don't think even I don't know what they do
00:06:45:00 - 00:06:47:08
Stefan
Okay. Once we get them.
00:06:47:10 - 00:06:49:02
Jens
That that's that's an Easter egg.
00:06:49:06 - 00:07:05:29
Stefan
Like okay. So okay. Oh, okay. I'm going to be completely honest with you. So Prisma when I use
it was an ORM. Now they're pivoting from idea to scale. Simplified. What does that even mean.
00:07:06:01 - 00:07:35:19
Jens
Ship production apps at lightning speed and scale to a global audience effortlessly with our next
gen serverless database. You know what? What I think what is the the problem. So from idea to
scale simplified, it means nothing. I don't know like I, I if I read it and I don't know what is the
product and then they say next gen serverless database, I think the hero should be next gen
serverless database.
00:07:35:21 - 00:07:41:03
Jens
But what this but this is the hero, right? The next gen serverless database.
00:07:41:05 - 00:08:02:28
Stefan
Yes. But I feel like they're trying to be like, super base here. They got the green going on now,
right? And it's what is super base from, build in a week ship to millions. Yeah, I don't know, but I
think you're right here. Like, also, if you look up here, Prisma, Postgres is now generally
available. So that's what they're trying to sell.
00:08:02:28 - 00:08:05:02
Stefan
Now this should absolutely be.
00:08:05:04 - 00:08:40:18
Jens
Yeah. The that's there's one problem I have with this whole hero. So for many conversations
and again like our landing page is also bad, but what I heard from many people is that the
landing page, it should have an action. So for example, the hero should say, I don't know, build
apps faster or something. And from idea to scale, simplified.
00:08:40:21 - 00:08:45:11
Jens
It's a bit hard for me to connect this to just the database.
00:08:45:13 - 00:09:03:21
Stefan
What's interesting here, though, is like the single call for action is getting started for free. I don't
know, for me, I'm not sold on that also right here. Like they just have logos going across. But
what I've heard before is like you need to see like what the logos are doing. So trusted by tells
you that they are customers.
00:09:03:23 - 00:09:13:13
Stefan
Used in production by okay, those are my customers or it's used or at least are using it in
production. When you have an empty wall like this, this doesn't tell me anything that's
interesting.
00:09:13:17 - 00:09:39:07
Jens
Okay, scroll a bit because there's good stuff actually. So one one thing I like is how they tell a
story as you scroll. I think this is a very good thing. So, we built something truly unique. First of
all, I think I would not make it about us, so not we I would make it about the user.
00:09:39:07 - 00:09:44:27
Jens
Like you can build something truly unique or. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:45:00 - 00:09:54:24
Stefan
Something unique. Oh, yeah. You're absolutely right. Yes. It's something they you with the
power of Prisma can build something unique. I also agree with you on that.
00:09:54:26 - 00:10:19:21
Jens
Okay, then get a database in an instant. That is. That's good, I understand it. Redefine how your
database works okay. That's about the ORM. We know it and then. But but you know what's
important. Those is a go go back go back. So redefine how your database works on the left
side. They they show me the ORM. Then they have a little label caching.
00:10:19:24 - 00:10:26:17
Jens
And then on the right side they have uni kernel powered.
00:10:26:19 - 00:10:58:01
Jens
I really don't understand the message like absolutely not. You know the, the I think what they
are trying to say is they can completely change my workflow based on the unikernel technology,
but they make this a little link and it's, it's a sub message. It's. I don't yeah, I don't know, I think I
would make this unikernel thing more prominent because maybe that's, that's the real game
changer, which I'm not sure if it is.
00:10:58:01 - 00:11:04:07
Stefan
But by the way, guess where this links.
00:11:04:09 - 00:11:08:06
Jens
Guess where this links. It looks like an external link.
00:11:08:08 - 00:11:18:18
Stefan
Yes, but it doesn't even link to a. If you look down here to the left, it links to a blog post. It
doesn't even link to its own landing page. I feel like that's kind of weak.
00:11:18:20 - 00:11:36:18
Jens
Okay, it should definitely not be an external. It should be, yeah. You know, if you click on product
or can you have a product? Yeah. Here it should say unikernel powered serverless database.
00:11:36:20 - 00:11:40:10
Stefan
Yeah. Managed Postgres for global workloads.
00:11:40:13 - 00:11:42:23
Jens
Okay. Scroll a bit more.
00:11:42:26 - 00:11:46:18
Stefan
This is interesting though.
00:11:46:20 - 00:12:03:05
Jens
A collaborative console experience for your team. So find many. It has more latency. The rest of
the screen I think this is very useful. Get AI powered recommendations to optimize code
performance. This is very good.
00:12:03:08 - 00:12:09:13
Stefan
Do you know what's completely missing, though? From everything.
00:12:09:16 - 00:12:25:16
Stefan
Where is the business value like okay, a collaborative console experience for your team. But
what does that do? It helps us find queries that are lower performing, which translates to what
business value? I haven't seen anything here. On the business side.
00:12:25:18 - 00:12:34:18
Jens
I have one comment on this. So they have prisma Postgres. I can use just Postgres right?
00:12:34:20 - 00:12:34:23
Stefan
Yeah.
00:12:34:25 - 00:12:42:19
Jens
So my biggest question is, as a CTO, why don't we just use AWS, RDS.
00:12:42:21 - 00:12:44:29
Stefan
Yeah.
00:12:45:01 - 00:12:54:12
Stefan
It doesn't tell you to. Like it says, we built something unique. Here's why. For a CTO, it feels like
magic. What does that mean? Like, how does it feel like magic?
00:12:54:15 - 00:13:09:28
Jens
Yeah. You know, I kind of, Yeah, I think I understand what you're saying, so you're you're you're
kind of thinking is. Okay, this is all nice, this cool. But why do I need it? Well, what does it give
me?
00:13:10:00 - 00:13:28:15
Stefan
Yeah. There's no, like, proof. Like, my biggest problem with this landing page is okay, there is no
social proof here. It's just a bunch of logos. It doesn't say used in production by. It doesn't tell
me what business value that I'm going to get from it. And then down here is way too low. Is
boom. There's the social proof.
00:13:28:17 - 00:13:52:12
Stefan
This should be much higher. I don't understand there. But all these points that they've shown me
doesn't tell me any of the business value. Okay. So if how we work with the data base like for
example this one. So you're running on bare metal servers okay. Here to our global edge
network. What does that translate to. That means that your users are going to get access to
whatever they're looking for faster.
00:13:52:12 - 00:14:10:16
Stefan
So your website's going to be faster. If you're an e-commerce website, it's lower latency, lower
latency and everything like, okay, what does that mean to your customers? Well, lower latency.
That means that the website's more performant. They're most likely to buy more because they
can go quickly to the shopping cart. We've seen it with eBay in our case studies, but where is
the business value of what Prisma is redefining?
00:14:10:16 - 00:14:12:05
Stefan
You know what I mean?
00:14:12:08 - 00:14:31:18
Jens
Okay, can you quickly hop to our landing page? We will not yet talk about it. I want I just want to
point one thing out because we have a we have a quote on our website from eBay and that
quote, it is so good because it has super important elements.
00:14:31:20 - 00:14:34:29
Stefan
All right. Let's jump into wundergraph. Can you see it?
00:14:35:02 - 00:14:37:29
Jens
Yes. don't roast anything.
00:14:37:29 - 00:14:39:02
Stefan
I will save it till the very end.
00:14:39:03 - 00:15:17:22
Jens
No no no no no we're doing it. We're roasting later. Okay. Here from eBay, our investment in
WunderGraph's highly performant open source platform will help boost eBay's API ecosystem.
So it's technical and enable our teams to work faster and smarter in building products that help
our sellers thrive. So he is able to. In one single sentence, he talks about a technical solution
that enables people to to do something faster, but not just inside their own company, but actually
the customers of eBay.
00:15:17:22 - 00:15:38:15
Jens
So he's able to talk about like the improvements within eBay, but also the improvements for like
he links that to the customer. And so even if you're a non-technical person, you will read this
and you will see, oh, this makes the sellers thrive. Okay, that must be good. Even if you don't
understand what an API is.
00:15:38:18 - 00:15:54:18
Stefan
Yeah. That's it. So I think the whole quote, by the way, is on the customer's page. I know we we
clicked it, but I totally agree with you. I have some feedback on these, but let's jump away from
ours for now and then we'll get back to roasting it. Let me share one that I think you don't like.
00:15:54:21 - 00:16:20:16
Stefan
but I think is amazing. Okay. Do you think it's a little bit I don't know, you'll see when I, when I
bring it up for the. Here we go. Okay, okay. For those of you that don't know, this is planet scale.
It is the. They used to have a complex data, a complex landing site, and then they completely
stripped it out.
00:16:20:19 - 00:16:28:03
Stefan
I think it's fantastic. But I will let you go first. Jens, what are your initial thoughts on Planet
Scales landing page?
00:16:28:06 - 00:17:01:21
Jens
Okay, let's let's look at the hero. The world's faster and most reliable relational database. It's a
bold statement. Very it's a very bold statement. And then the next thing then there is a blurb. But
somehow, visually, I skip this because in the next blob, in the in the next paragraph, there's a
link and it says our blazing fast NVMe drives unlock unlimited IOPs, blah blah blah.
00:17:01:24 - 00:17:22:18
Jens
Okay, plan and scale managed. Then they link to performance so they are probably able to
prove this. They link to Vitesse and they show our technology powers. Tier zero databases.
Okay, click on tier zero. What is that?
00:17:22:20 - 00:17:29:27
Stefan
Did it change the page? Oh yeah. Yeah. Great. To a freaking case study. Cash app, cash apps.
00:17:30:00 - 00:17:34:28
Jens
That is it. Okay, go. Go back, go back.
00:17:35:01 - 00:18:17:05
Jens
So from the design, you would say, Holy shit, this is ugly, right? But at the same time, who is the
target audience? The target audience is people who want a relational database that speaks
SQL. And it needs to be scalable to the point where nobody else has scale databases will those
will database people will they will they like flashy diagrams or a terminal style website with hard
facts like these people, they, they, you know, they, they look at very yeah.
00:18:17:06 - 00:18:32:16
Jens
Explain query and things. So they look at terminals. I think the only thing to convince them is,
does it, does it scale? And here we have, we have slack and and others and
00:18:32:19 - 00:18:54:25
Stefan
Look at this though, like, like you said, like so database people, I mean, they're all about
sharding, performance, scaling it out. And I know Sam, he has crazy experience. But when you
buy Planet Scale, you're getting technology. And the expertise that ran in scale to YouTube, the
internet's number two site, and the team that scaled GitHub to over 100 million users globally,
that's a very bold statement.
00:18:55:01 - 00:18:56:25
Stefan
That is some big social proof.
00:18:57:00 - 00:19:02:23
Jens
You know, like I have some feedback actually, maybe the like a I guess I like this one.
00:19:02:23 - 00:19:05:15
Stefan
So we'll agree to disagree. It's Sam. Sam.
00:19:05:17 - 00:19:34:08
Jens
No, I'm not disagree I'm not disagree. But my my feedback for Sam is this, I know vitesse. I
understand what it is. It might take a little bit of time until everybody at this page understands
what it that this is. This is vitesse in a very professional way and not everybody knows that
vitesse was actually built by YouTube to sustain the scale of YouTube.
00:19:34:14 - 00:19:54:01
Jens
So what I would make more like I think I would build a, like a, like a bigger hero. And I would say
something like, everybody can now use the database that was able to sustain YouTube scale.
00:19:54:03 - 00:19:58:23
Stefan
What about this? And you see the change page. So he has it on a separate one.
00:19:59:00 - 00:19:59:18
Jens
Yeah.
00:19:59:21 - 00:20:08:17
Stefan
you like, you know.
Honestly that's cool by the way that you said it though, without, you know, your stuff Jens. But
00:20:08:20 - 00:20:38:25
Jens
YouTube, YouTube took MySQL and they built this sharding layer on top of MySQL because
MySQL eventually you have too much data. So you need to split your data into, into shards. And
essentially like we test it is an orchestration layer to, to to shard your MySQL database. It has
some trade offs, like you cannot do all, all operations, that you would do with a normal, relational
database.
00:20:38:25 - 00:21:03:04
Jens
But you can shape your schema in a way that it, it works with shards. It was developed by, by,
YouTube and it's an open source project. And I think, planet scale took, took over the project.
And I think they, they run this on, on Kubernetes or something. Now, it seems they also heavily
rely on, on, bare metal to improve performance.
00:21:03:04 - 00:21:27:12
Jens
And, I really like the company. I really like what, what planet scale is doing. I think the, like the
customer base is probably very narrow, like, not everybody needs planet scale. Most people are
like an unplanet scale they announced as well. But I think the page is good. Can we scroll a little
bit and see a little bit more?
00:21:27:15 - 00:21:47:15
Stefan
Yes. This is where they start to kind of unlock like for you from a developer point of view, would
you say like in the database world, that performance is probably the most important I or do they
just maybe go in order here? So they start with performance and they start pitching their new
product, which is planet scale metal, and right away is they just kind of that's we were talking
about this is like the cache warmer.
00:21:47:19 - 00:21:50:02
Jens
That's great. The diagram is great.
00:21:50:04 - 00:21:52:08
Stefan
That is that insane, by the.
00:21:52:08 - 00:21:56:06
Jens
Screenshot of Our cache Warmer. It should be on our page.
00:21:56:09 - 00:22:16:14
Stefan
Exactly. This is I mean, performance. Boom. Here's how. Cosmo. You know, we can this is
actually great. We can take some learnings from here. But look at this. They put right away
performance. They tell you what it does. They have this non like you can't even argue with this
screenshot. That's pretty insane. And then they have a customer quote with it which is pretty
amazing.
00:22:16:16 - 00:22:20:24
Jens
Yeah I I can you scroll a bit more.
00:22:20:26 - 00:22:23:18
Stefan
This is where they talk about like this by the way.
00:22:23:21 - 00:22:26:24
Jens
Yeah that's pretty cool. No.
00:22:26:26 - 00:22:38:25
Stefan
Oh is by the way it's a single page application. So whatever you click on it just routes you to the
thing which is cool okay. This is important. So uptime they offer 99.999. Damn.
00:22:38:25 - 00:22:41:06
Jens
Well do you know what that means.
00:22:41:09 - 00:22:51:09
Stefan
Oh I don't have the calculator. But all I know is it's like minutes. It's crazy a month. So what is
99.99999 in a month?
00:22:51:11 - 00:22:57:09
Jens
That's a website like, I don't know, nines.com or something.
00:22:57:11 - 00:23:07:09
Stefan
Let me see. I'm not sure what the url was. Okay. What's the calculator? So it was 99.999.
00:23:07:12 - 00:23:08:21
Jens
It's so funny when you said.
00:23:08:21 - 00:23:33:00
Stefan
Oh my God. Okay, so daily downtime available is 0.86 seconds weekly six seconds monthly 26
seconds yearly, five minutes, quarterly one minute, and 20s. That is some crazy uptime. Holy
crap, how are they able to? I don't even want to ask. And they also have.
00:23:33:00 - 00:23:39:12
Jens
Yeah, they they they need to do a lot of testing and everything. So it's it's a lot of work to, to do
this. Well.
00:23:39:12 - 00:23:47:24
Stefan
Done. And then here. Okay. So now we're down to the cost. Oh bring your own cloud.
00:23:47:27 - 00:24:12:23
Jens
I think it's good. I would say my number one point that I think is missing, I would go more on the
point that running vitesse yourself is very hard. Just use just use planet scale with this, with the
SLA, but. Yeah. Oh, well, I like the page. It's good.
00:24:12:26 - 00:24:18:07
Stefan
Okay. Your turn. What landing page should we look at next?
00:24:18:09 - 00:24:39:17
Jens
Okay. Go. So I want vercel and retool. Vercel. You need to go on an incognito, because you.
Otherwise you might log in. If you have a vercel account. It's a bit weird because, vercel. It it
forces. It brings you immediately to your dashboard. If you are using it.
00:24:39:19 - 00:24:48:23
Stefan
So if you do, if you do vercel slash home, this is their main one, right?
00:24:48:26 - 00:24:49:27
Jens
Yep.
00:24:50:00 - 00:25:01:06
Stefan
Yeah. So it's vercel.com/home. All right. So of course we have the iconic triangle. Okay. Well
let's start your complete platform for the web.
00:25:01:09 - 00:25:04:22
Jens
We should also, roast SST.
00:25:04:24 - 00:25:11:15
Stefan
Yeah. Yeah, we definitely will. So we'll go through SSTs. We can even go to Apollos if you want.
Okay.
00:25:11:17 - 00:25:30:03
Jens
Your complete platform for the web. So it's not active. It's not doing something for me. Vercel
provides the developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale and secure a faster, more
personalized web. I would say it's it's not bad.
00:25:30:05 - 00:25:37:27
Stefan
web apps, I don't.
Start deploying. Good demo. Okay. And then here so they go straight to social proof. So AI apps
00:25:37:27 - 00:25:55:18
Jens
Know it's it's not just social proof it's it's they immediately go to benefits. Runway build times
went down from seven minutes to 40s. Reduction 95% reduction in page loads go to web apps.
00:25:55:20 - 00:26:01:04
Stefan
I didn't notice, by the way. That's three different companies Adobe, chick fil A, neo.
00:26:01:06 - 00:26:13:02
Jens
I think this is amazing. Like at the very beginning, like if you are a business person, you know
what is a website and Vercel gives you all these benefits.
00:26:13:05 - 00:26:23:14
Stefan
These are some crazy ones too. This one is interesting how they saved one year of developer
time, but look 100% uptime during Black Friday. Even if you're a business person, these are
very important.
00:26:23:16 - 00:26:39:16
Jens
I just have one. One little thing. Which one? You need to click on all these buttons to actually
find all those benefits. I'm not sure if if that's so good, I don't know. Can you not show more of
this without clicking?
00:26:39:18 - 00:26:49:06
Stefan
You can if you go to, resources and then customers. But again, you still have to click through
them and then you can get the full case study. Okay.
00:26:49:08 - 00:26:51:12
Jens
Go back to.
00:26:51:14 - 00:27:10:08
Stefan
They've got some great company logos. And then here get started using our pre-built okay. Now
they have the AI. So this is what V zero. But you know what I'm kind of confused about. If I
wasn't a developer, like if I was a CTO, I kind of still like and I haven't coded in a while. I don't
know if I would understand it yet.
00:27:10:10 - 00:27:17:07
Stefan
Like I'm still kind of a little bit fuzzy, like, okay, so Vercel is a tool that helps me make my website
faster. Is that what I'm getting?
00:27:17:09 - 00:27:25:28
Jens
website.
No, it's it's your complete platform for the web. So you just need vercel and you can build a
00:27:26:01 - 00:27:32:15
Stefan
Okay. And but is there like a WordPress. Does it like provide me like the templates, like how do I
actually build the website?
00:27:32:15 - 00:27:35:04
Jens
You pretend to be stupid, right?
00:27:35:06 - 00:27:38:02
Stefan
Okay. That's. Yeah.
00:27:38:04 - 00:27:42:18
Jens
Like dude it's it's it's just Next.js and. Yeah.
00:27:42:18 - 00:27:46:15
Stefan
So but if I showed this to my mom, she I don't think she'd understand it.
00:27:46:15 - 00:27:49:03
Jens
Okay. Your mom probably doesn't need Vercel.
00:27:49:06 - 00:28:00:14
Stefan
Yeah. Very true. Okay, so git connected. Deployments, developer focused. The collaborative
feature, we always have some thoughts on this. This is interesting. What do you think so far?
This part right here. Let's do this.
00:28:00:18 - 00:28:25:14
Jens
From localhost to https. It's it's good I, I understand you make a git push it builds and deploys.
Great. Every deploy is remarkable. Check with your team. Unreal production. Great UI not just
designs. Yeah. That's that's cool. Privacy friendly lightweight analytics. So we get analytics with
the extra benefit being privacy friendly I mean.
00:28:25:16 - 00:28:44:04
Stefan
Okay by the way do you know what I've noticed about the website. Like look how snazzy and
smooth it is. Like they're doing a testimonial of their website already by having a really good
website. You see this? Yeah, it's quite sexy. All right. Instant rollbacks.
00:28:44:06 - 00:28:50:24
Jens
Go ahead. Deploy on Friday. Yep. Move fast. Don't break things. Yep.
00:28:50:26 - 00:29:05:24
Stefan
And then scale your enterprise without compromising security. Deploy once. Deliver
everywhere. Yeah. Overall, I like their website. I think it's fantastic.
00:29:05:26 - 00:29:34:00
Jens
Yeah, I think, you know, and this is something I, I would say this you can see it with, with bigger
companies, if you are smaller you're more active in the hero like do this or like, you know,
deploy faster with Vercel. But if you are so big as vercel, if the brand already is so strong, then
you go go back to what they are your complete platform for the web.
00:29:34:03 - 00:29:37:23
Jens
And I think you can only do this when you are big enough.
00:29:37:25 - 00:29:47:11
Stefan
I actually think there's some other cool ones that we can go through, but all right, let's let's
Vercel is good. Let's do retool.
00:29:47:13 - 00:29:48:24
Jens
I like retool.
00:29:48:27 - 00:29:49:13
Stefan
You like retool.
00:29:49:15 - 00:29:57:21
Jens
Website not not not the not the tool. I, I've never used retool, but I like the website.
00:29:57:24 - 00:30:17:06
Stefan
Okay. I love the hero, by the way. The best way to build internal software right away. It tells you
what it does. So and then the bottom seamlessly connect databases, build with elegant
components, and customize with code. Accelerate mundane tasks, freeing up time for work. I
actually don't love this part. I do love this part.
00:30:17:09 - 00:30:42:16
Jens
So. The best way to build internal software. So first of all, I immediately know what they do. Also
this this dashboard on the on the right. It supports this. So I immediately know what they do.
Scroll back up I don't know it. One problem I have is the best way to everybody can say that's
like how do you prove it?
00:30:42:18 - 00:30:59:29
Jens
And then seamlessly connect databases built with elegant components and customized with
code, accelerate mundane tasks, freeing up time for the work that matters most? Yeah, I'm not
sure it's a bit weak. You're right.
00:31:00:01 - 00:31:08:02
Stefan
I think it's weak. Obviously. Then you have the two buttons, but I think this is super powerful.
Sometimes I hate websites like this and sometimes I love them, but okay.
00:31:08:05 - 00:31:10:06
Jens
One comment on the hero.
00:31:10:08 - 00:31:12:25
Stefan
Let's go back.
00:31:12:27 - 00:31:18:09
Jens
What do you see? What do you say the the book. A demo is actually invisible.
00:31:18:11 - 00:31:40:11
Stefan
Yes. And also what I've noticed is since it's to the left. But this is moving here to the right, it kind
of distracts me. You see what I mean? And this looks a little bit. Yeah. Okay. So could use some
work and then that's just one scroll, by the way.
00:31:40:14 - 00:31:42:13
Jens
And then the transition is cool.
00:31:42:16 - 00:31:54:11
Stefan
But it doesn't tell me it's just like okay so you can build apps okay. You can build workflows,
database I can build mobile apps. Is that what it's saying?
00:31:54:14 - 00:32:16:10
Jens
You know, what is my problem? And that's funny. So I was scrolling because I thought apps,
workflows, database and mobile. I thought this is actually just text I didn't think about. I could
hover it, oh, go, go back up and scroll. No, no, don't move the mouse somewhere else.
00:32:16:13 - 00:32:18:20
Stefan
Okay. So just scroll.
00:32:18:22 - 00:32:25:02
Jens
And scroll further. Oh yeah. I didn't even notice that you can do this.
00:32:25:05 - 00:32:28:12
Stefan
Yeah. It's kind of Okay.
00:32:28:13 - 00:32:32:00
Jens
You're you're smarter than me. You you hover that.
00:32:32:03 - 00:32:54:19
Stefan
And then here. Okay. So you got social proof. But again it doesn't I mean they got some great
logos on DoorDash. Where's Volvo? Pinterest. dnoeglskr Jesus. They've got some great ones.
And so okay. So why retool. So it's built for developers connect anything with the rest or
GraphQL API or choose from seven integrations securely share resources and queries across
the team.
00:32:54:21 - 00:32:57:09
Stefan
So the integration part.
00:32:57:11 - 00:33:01:08
Jens
Do you know what? What completely distracts me here?
00:33:01:10 - 00:33:03:12
Stefan
Is it this?
00:33:03:15 - 00:33:05:13
Jens
It's a logo.
00:33:05:15 - 00:33:09:13
Stefan
Oh SAP.
00:33:09:16 - 00:33:39:00
Stefan
That's terrifying to be honest. Yeah. No. Next. Okay, so you connect everything, then you design
it with 100 extensible react code, and then you've got code written in SQL, JavaScript, Python,
integrate with SSL rule base okay. Debugging this one's a little bit weak. Review. That's
interesting. And then deploy and you visible. And anyway it's kind of cool. No I like it.
00:33:39:00 - 00:33:40:15
Stefan
I like their little flow that they have here.
00:33:40:15 - 00:33:43:25
Jens
Yeah it's cool. Also when you scroll you can just scroll through this.
00:33:43:27 - 00:34:07:00
Stefan
Yeah okay cool. So okay now use cases. So if you want to build an admin panel, if you want to
build genAI apps, if you want to build SQL dashboards, workflows, partner portals and then
compliance. This is pretty cool. So reminds me of Miami through Miami Vice Vibes.
00:34:07:03 - 00:34:09:03
Jens
Yeah.
00:34:09:05 - 00:34:16:20
Stefan
Overall I like their page. I really like how it tells the story. Like, sure, I could use a little bit of
work, but I think it's fantastic. Yeah.
00:34:16:23 - 00:34:36:00
Jens
I have a little bit of fear because I think, retool is, is, I think it's a bit in danger because, I think
with the, with the right prompts, many of these things you can cursor today. Right.
00:34:36:02 - 00:34:42:15
Stefan
I would also say so it could be a little bit fearful. I have one by the way. I don't oh go ahead.
00:34:42:18 - 00:35:11:00
Jens
I just saw someone talking about this on on social media. They, they were using retool and they
found it a bit complicated to, to do something and also bit expensive. And they, they just prompt
the cursor and build an internal tool, deployed it on Vercel. And Vercel gives you authentication.
Now, now you don't need this stuff anymore.
00:35:11:02 - 00:35:11:16
Stefan
Yeah. What do you.
00:35:11:16 - 00:35:12:13
Jens
Think?
00:35:12:16 - 00:35:27:22
Stefan
I also think it's going to feed into our next company. I don't know if you've ever seen their landing
page, so it's going to be a surprise, but I think you're absolutely right. Have you ever heard of
Apollo? No. This one. This one's interesting.
00:35:27:24 - 00:35:29:15
Jens
We have to roast Apollo.
