00;00;24;02 - 00;00;36;18
Stefan
And we're alive. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing. As usual, we're a little bit late. I apologize. That was on my behalf. But again, I'm joined by Jens. Jens how are you doing today?

00;00;36;20 - 00;00;40;23
Jens
So when we don't have guests now, I am your special guest.

00;00;40;25 - 00;00;45;03
Stefan
Yeah. And then when we do have guests, you're just my guest. Yeah.

00;00;45;03 - 00;00;55;02
Jens
I like, do you know, like, who is it? Is it Jimmy Kimmel or someone they have, like this? This, the thing on the side, like, like a skeleton or what is it?

00;00;55;05 - 00;00;59;04
Stefan
Yeah, I forgot who it was. Don't. But he has the skeleton. It has a name?

00;00;59;06 - 00;01;00;14
Jens
Yeah. The skull.

00;01;00;17 - 00;01;01;13
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. That's you.

00;01;01;16 - 00;01;04;16
Jens
I'm. I'm your. I'm your skull.

00;01;04;18 - 00;01;17;04
Stefan
Yeah. I mean, when we don't have a guest for sure. But it's good to have you back on the show. We've been off for a little bit, so I apologize, but we're working on getting more guests, and we're going to be working on a better cadence with Jacob, so it's going to be awesome. We're going to keep going forward.

00;01;17;04 - 00;01;36;06
Stefan
We're doubling down on our content strategy. But I think today is going to be an interesting episode. I'm not as bubbly today because the reports of our demise as the name of the title have been greatly exaggerated. And honestly, one of my favorite things about being a founder and following other founders is how passionate they get.

00;01;36;09 - 00;01;53;12
Stefan
Like, you see Elon Musk yelling at Sam Altman on Twitter, or you see Guillermo yelling at the Replit founder, and people are like, oh, you're bigger than that. But I've always been a guy that passion is important. If you watch tennis, Novak Djokovic, gets upset, Cristiano Ronaldo gets upset. All the best players in the world get upset.

00;01;53;15 - 00;02;14;18
Stefan
And it's the same thing. And founders, because it's a high stakes game. And so recently there's been a lot of reports and I know Jens, he's a little bit less emotional than me, but if you piss him off, he comes in with the facts. Jens. Talk to me a little bit about what's been kind of been said in the community recently, especially around GraphQL Conf, and like the direction that we're going.

00;02;14;20 - 00;02;21;01
Stefan
It's a little bit upsetting. I'm not going to lie to you.

00;02;21;04 - 00;02;23;03
Jens


00;02;23;06 - 00;02;28;15
Stefan
He's trying to think of it as the most political way he could say.

00;02;28;18 - 00;02;39;01
Jens
I don't know. I'm, I, I'm, I'm typically ranting, but, how how would you put it? What what what was being said?

00;02;39;03 - 00;02;52;22
Stefan
Well, well, a little bit of backstory. So you guys know about Wunder Graph? We've been really focusing on Federation, and it's gotten to a point where customers are coming to us and like, wow, you really know your stuff. And you're like, oh, if you've been working on this since 2018, you think you would know. And we do.

00;02;52;23 - 00;03;09;18
Stefan
We love Federation. We love solving problems for our customers. And when you start to eat a little bit of the market share, sometimes people will look at you like a toy and they'll be like, oh, that's cute what they're doing over there. But then slowly that toy gets bigger and bigger and they start eating more and more and they get bigger customers.

00;03;09;21 - 00;03;32;22
Stefan
And then they go, oh my God, there's a threat. And so recently, Apollo has deemed us as a threat and has been just putting blatant lies, if you will, into the ecosystem saying things about us. We can talk about what happened at GraphQL conf, why we didn't go, why we're investing into federation. But basically the backstory is competitors have been saying that we're moving away from federation, which by the way, I think is ridiculous.

00;03;32;22 - 00;03;39;04
Stefan
But Jens, can you set the record straight? Are we moving away from Federation?

00;03;39;06 - 00;04;09;10
Jens
Like obviously not. And I think we're we're the biggest innovators in the in the space actually. If you look at our blog wundergraph.com/blog, you will find, I don't know, 100 plus blog pro blog posts from myself and teammates, but mostly from myself about the topic of GraphQL and Federation. I think I'm the only person, or I'm the I'm the number one person.

00;04;09;10 - 00;04;29;25
Jens
And by the way, I'm not bragging at all like I'm. If you know me, I'm never someone like, I never put myself on a, like a podium or something. It's not what I do. I'm more like a tactful person, but I am. I'm number one person to write blog posts about GraphQL and Federation. Absolutely. Just by numbers.

00;04;29;25 - 00;05;02;22
Jens
So why would we not care about federation? Just recently we solved a very, very interesting problem together with eBay. eBay, I would say one of the biggest users in, GraphQL, and Federation. And they, they didn't just partner with us. They're not the customer. Not just the customer. They're also an investor. And what this relationship allows us to do is, first of all, we're building an open source implementation of GraphQL federation.

00;05;02;24 - 00;05;33;05
Jens
And people like, if you throw mud at us and you're like, oh, we're, we're doing cosmo connect, we're doing gRPC on the backend side, we're moving away from, from Federation. Then my first answer will be like, what do you mean by federation? Like what what what spec? And the reality is, there never was a spec. There will never be a spec currently because Apollo doesn't want a spec.

00;05;33;05 - 00;06;14;24
Jens
Apollo doesn't want competition. I think competition is amazing for the for the customer, for the for the market. And the other thing is, currently there's this composite schema working group. It's driven by chili cream people. And Apollo does a little bit of consulting. So the, the people who drive the space, is it Apollo. And then like before you throw mud at like like in a David versus Goliath style, why don't you just innovate and build better products so that nobody would actually care?

00;06;14;27 - 00;06;49;20
Jens
So to me, it looks like we're just such a strong competitor that it is now time to talk negatively about that. About us. And honestly, one of the policies we always had and I'm kind of I'm upset and I'm, I'm reconsidering this. But one of the policies, you can ask every single of our prospects when we're on, when we are on a sales call, we really try to avoid mentioning names of our competitors.

00;06;49;22 - 00;07;13;25
Jens
Just because we don't want to, to focus on on competition. We want to focus on on solving the customer problem. And it's kind of like unwritten rule for us. We we never go like, negatively against the competition. It's we we always focus on okay, customer. How can we help them. What what can we do. And it's just I don't know, it's it's a change in behavior.

00;07;13;27 - 00;07;47;05
Jens
We take note and our our take is to focus on customers, to focus on relationships with people like eBay. By the way, ask yourself, why is one of the biggest users of Federation? Why are they leaving the market leader? Why are they going with us building something open source together? And and what what is this relationship leading to?

00;07;47;11 - 00;08;32;01
Jens
Because if you look at what we recently built with, with, eBay, it's actually quite interesting because, thanks to eBay, we can solve problems in Federation that you don't even know exist. And we solve them today, for you to use tomorrow. So to give you one example, eBay has a use case where if you have a very sensitive piece of information in your in your graph for example, when a listing on the eBay page ends or something, because you, you don't want to tell everybody when, when the listing ends because it, it could be used for market manipulation or whatever.

00;08;32;03 - 00;09;04;20
Jens
So the problem here is Apollo introduced the requires directive and again like not negative against Apollo. But the point is if you introduce such a directive you need to think about the, the the consequences, the repercussions. And what are the effects of using such a directive? In our case, what we figured out through eBay is when one service has a sensitive field and another service says through.

00;09;04;20 - 00;09;31;00
Jens
The requires directive. I want to have that field to resolve another field, unknowing of the other service. Another team now has access to that field. So if you try to follow compliance regulations and one service, is, I would say like audited and is compliant and now another service can just request that field. You might not even be aware of that.

00;09;31;03 - 00;09;58;03
Jens
So it creates a loophole in your system. There's there's a component of authorization where you think authorization is something that happens between the client and the server in federation, authorization also happens between subgraphs. And it's very important to think about the mechanics and what happens if one subgraph requires a field from another one. So we introduced a new directive.

00;09;58;06 - 00;10;29;12
Jens
I think it was something like, fetch reasons or. I don't know, David, you can tell me what's the what's the right name. It's also unorthodox. And if you can enable that, you, you we will essentially tell in metadata. One subgraph, we will we will tell them that, yeah. Require fetch reasons. Thanks, David. So, you if you put that on a field and the field is being requested, we tell the subgraph why we are requesting it.

00;10;29;14 - 00;10;58;29
Jens
And so now we're, we're, compliant. Another issue we we found through eBay. EBay is also again requires if you require fields from another subgraph. And that field, that field, doesn't resolve and it returns an error and the field is nullable. We will then render an an entity representation call to that subgraph and send null.

00;10;59;02 - 00;11;27;14
Jens
And this is a problem because, yeah, null might not be like a valid key or something. So then the second, subgraph is confused because it requires that field. So if there was an error, we should actually stop or we should think about the meaning of null. And that is another interesting topic. We recently, added support for semantic non null.

00;11;27;17 - 00;11;50;00
Jens
There was, like a huge discussion in the GraphQL community, around semantic, non null. And how can you distinguish, nothing. Well, where nothing has a meaning. So absence of a value can have a meaning, or it can mean there is no data or it can mean there was an error. And you need to distinguish all these cases and semantic non null does that.

00;11;50;02 - 00;12;31;09
Jens
And we're we're I think the, the first federation. Solution that that supports it. It doesn't matter that we are the first or something that that's not the point. But the point is we're we're heavily investing. And yeah, instead of talking negatively about us, just be better. And I can assure you, the the reason we didn't go to the, to the, shit this monologue this long, but the reason we, we didn't go to the conferences, we recently really scaled the team and we were focusing on one on three very, very big projects.

00;12;31;11 - 00;12;54;25
Jens
And we had to make a very difficult decision. We, we, we just thought like, okay, it's it's not the right timing. Like this year, we had some, some projects that slipped a bit and then we our, our roadmap wasn't executed the way we, we wanted to, which was, to some degree was my mistake. And so, yeah, this year we, we just couldn't make it.

00;12;54;27 - 00;13;28;00
Jens
But I can assure you, three products are coming over the next couple of months. This will be, like, game changing. In the in the community, all products focus on on, GraphQL and Federation. And. Yeah. So apologies for not for not coming and for not sponsoring and doing more, but we didn't want to, distract the team and, yeah, that's that's where we currently are.

00;13;28;03 - 00;13;43;12
Stefan
I think it's a good segue, though. So, we have a very fun hire that's going to be joining us on Monday. And the reason why it's fun is our strategy for 2026 is we're going to be at a lot of events. We're going to be at a lot of meetups. So something to keep in mind as we set those out.

00;13;43;12 - 00;14;09;05
Stefan
But mark it and set it up on your calendars once those might go out. But yeah, I think you hit on some couple good points there. But for our product roadmap, one of the things also that we've been hearing about everywhere is MCP MCP MCP AI AI AI. And we released MCP actually before Apollo did we have customers using it and they gave us feedback on it and they love it.

00;14;09;05 - 00;14;24;12
Stefan
But what is your take on AI in Federation and how is it going to change things and just your overall take on MCP? I know you sent me an interesting blog post yesterday that I read. So it would be good to kind of reference that one, but talk to me a little bit about our strategy with AI and MCP.

00;14;24;14 - 00;15;03;00
Jens
Yeah. So when MCP came out, we were like, okay, let's take a look. Let's build something, let's bring it into the market and see what happens. And as loud as other vendors want to shout, there currently is no interesting business model in the world of MCP and GraphQL. You can have a GraphQL schema and you can put MCP on top, and now you have MCP things and you can you can somehow talk to your graph through persisted operations or something.

00;15;03;00 - 00;15;30;08
Jens
And the like LLMs are cool like that. There are some, some use cases that are really, really interesting. And at the same time, if I have a really if my graph isn't designed well and if my, if my Federation doesn't work, then your MCP also doesn't work. And I think the biggest problem for, for MCP, that federation can solve is.

00;15;30;10 - 00;15;52;24
Jens
We we can we can help you put all data sources together, have like, a centralized governance and integration layer. And through cosmo connect, we can make it super simple to add not just REST APIs but really anything like, even like we can turn a PDF or an Excel spreadsheet into an API. Like anything can be a subgraph.

00;15;52;24 - 00;16;21;23
Jens
Now. And so I think that's that's an important point. Governance and access controls and access policies, that's, that's a very big topic and we're investing into that. But ultimately, I think what the federation can give you is the backbone of MCP. It, it, it can be that integration layer. But like, what can you really do on the, on the MCP side.

00;16;21;23 - 00;17;12;16
Jens
Like, yeah, you can put an MCP server on top and now an LLm can can talk to some tools. That's nice, but is it like is it worth like the super big hype. And for us, this is something we were thinking about heavily. And one thing we kind of concluded is, if you have a graph and you have MCP, at what point will MCP stop to be efficient in terms of, you know, imagine you have and there's this case studies and I can if you're interested, you can DM me, I can I can give you some some link to some papers, but, there's case studies about the efficiency of LLMs to choose

00;17;12;19 - 00;17;42;08
Jens
models, to, to, to choose tools. And the problem is, if you add too many tools, then stuff gets out of hand and the LLM is less and less efficient in choosing the tool. And so one topic that we are currently investing in is if, if I have a question, if I have a prompt, how can I figure out the, the subset of the graph that is relevant to me?

00;17;42;10 - 00;18;16;02
Jens
And this is a very big problem, because if you if you have a huge graph with thousands of types or hundreds or thousands of types, the next big challenge will be how can I choose? Or how can I create a tool from that graph that really solves my problem? And if you dive into that space, I, I've seen demos from other vendors, and what they do is they take the schema, they give it to cursor, and then they ask cursor to create, to create a query.

00;18;16;05 - 00;18;44;09
Jens
And so we investigated this. We, we tried these kind of things out. The performance is really, really bad. And the and the accuracy and often times the problems come from surprise bad documentation. So if you have a GraphQL schema and the the types are not well documented, the entities are not well documented. The fields don't have meaningful documentation.

00;18;44;11 - 00;19;07;20
Jens
Imagine the following scenario. Let's say you have the GitHub schema and you, you remove all, all kinds of all, all descriptions, everything. It's just the schema, just types and fields. And let's say you come to the documentation of GitHub and you are not an API expert. You're not a GraphQL expert. You don't know so much about GitHub in general.

00;19;07;22 - 00;19;40;18
Jens
And you're like, you know what? I'm I'm interested. I want to see, all my repositories and the amount of stars I have or something. And now let's imagine on the semantic level that there is no end point to give you the amount of stars or maybe GitHub uses different language for that. So you can't just take the entirety of the GitHub steam schema, dump it into into an LLM, and ask the LLM to build a query.

00;19;40;20 - 00;20;01;12
Jens
By the way, LLMs cannot guarantee you like that the query will be will be valid, so they have to somehow iterate and validate. And you don't want to pollute the entire schema. You need to figure out what what parts of the schema are relevant for this use case. And sometimes the user doesn't really understand the language of the schema.

00;20;01;14 - 00;20;25;26
Jens
So you need to have like a translation layer so that that whole problem of of how can I help someone understand? Because if you want to build a query, it's ultimately about understanding the graph. And so we're currently investing into how can we make it easier for people to, to understand the graph and then take the requirements and turn that into, into, into valid queries.

00;20;25;26 - 00;20;51;09
Jens
And that's, that's like a very, very big and complex topic. It's also not a pure a pure MCP or graphql or a LLM topic. Like a lot of machine learning and algorithms go into that. And, yeah, it's an interesting topic and I hope kind of what I say, it underscores how much are we we, we thinking about this, this kind of space.

00;20;51;09 - 00;20;56;21
Jens
And then by no means we're, we're looking elsewhere.

00;20;56;23 - 00;20;59;27
Stefan
Today's show is sponsored by Jens’s monologues.

00;21;00;05 - 00;21;01;16
Jens
No kidding. The monologue.

00;21;01;16 - 00;21;22;03
Stefan
There. Fantastic. It kind of shows exactly how we feel about this. I'm still a little bit confused. One of the things that we've been talking about, though hard, is the entity layer. People might not be understanding what you mean by it. And again, this is going to trigger another monologue. But it's important. What is the real magic behind this entity layer and how does that feed into our AI strategy.

00;21;22;03 - 00;21;36;29
Stefan
How does that feed into the products that we're building, which are coming soon? As you mentioned, you know, we left or we weren't able to join GraphQF conf just because of our roadmap. I mean, things have exploded. We've scaled up the team. Everything is going good from a company point of view. But what is the entity layer like?

00;21;36;29 - 00;21;40;00
Stefan
Why is this so special and how does it feed into AI?

00;21;40;02 - 00;21;48;23
Jens
Why do you keep hammering against your microphone? Is it me again? No, it's I don't know, your uncle maybe.

00;21;48;23 - 00;21;50;29
Stefan
No, it's the stupid chair. I ordered a new one, though.

00;21;50;29 - 00;21;51;13
Jens
I don't know if.

00;21;51;21 - 00;21;53;03
Stefan
I'm going to step away from them.

00;21;53;06 - 00;22;03;07
Jens
But I hear you just said we have an AI strategy. Why? Why are you leaking that? Oops, oops oops. But talk to me about.

00;22;03;07 - 00;22;04;19
Stefan
The entity layer.

00;22;04;21 - 00;22;09;01
Jens
Can you have a startup these days without an AI strategy?

00;22;09;03 - 00;22;17;19
Stefan
No you can't. I mean, you won't get funding and you'll die. Like in this climate. It's a nuclear wasteland. It's all about AI.

00;22;17;21 - 00;22;25;06
Jens
Yeah. Okay. Entity layer.

00;22;25;09 - 00;23;22;29
Jens
David, asking about innovations. I mean, you're joining our all hands, right? I mean, maybe you should just listen. Kidding. Okay. Entity layer. So, Federation is cool. I truly think like the some some folks at some very smart engineers are, are or have been at Apollo who created the first version of of Federation. And I think one of the coolest concepts they came up with is the key directive which gives us entities, after the key directive, I, I kind of think that Apollo went into a little bit of, of a rush, maybe it came from their early success, but some other directives, they, they feel a little bit rough and a

00;23;22;29 - 00;23;53;14
Jens
little bit off. But I talked about this in the past anyways. Key directive, I think it's, it's, it's, it's it's very good because if you think about the key directive. So I keep talking, I would say less about Federation and a little bit more about the entity layer, because I think you can see the entity layer as a, as a construct, as a pattern independent of federation.

00;23;53;16 - 00;24;25;21
Jens
Federation. It's kind of like tightly coupled to, to GraphQL. And our, our kind of thinking is that, having a graph is, is, is is really key to creating a good microservice architecture. The big question is, do we need to have GraphQL on the front end, and do we need to have GraphQL on the backend? What are the benefits?

00;24;25;24 - 00;24;52;11
Jens
And if you look at I mean you can see what we're doing with with cosmo Connect. And we're replacing GraphQL on the backend side. But I see very little benefits, to be honest, in having GraphQL on the, on the backend. It, it simply means you need GraphQL frameworks that understand these very, very weird root fields like underscore, service and underscore entities.

00;24;52;11 - 00;25;28;23
Jens
And then you have this any type and all that stuff like these kind of hacks that allow federation to send batched requests to subgraphs like that. I mean, it's all hacks to make it work, but why? Why hacking when you can have a really good solution? We're currently building, I think the, the best possible, solution that can still be compatible, with the existing Federation stack and that's Cosmo connect, which means on the backend side, we take, we take, a GraphQL schema and subgraph schema.

00;25;28;25 - 00;25;57;23
Jens
We compile it into a proto, and then we have, we have a proto that understands data loading. So that means the router by default solves the data loading problem. You never need to think about data loading ever again. You just implement resolvers like RPC calls that, say, hey, give me give me ten products, for these IDs, and then you return ten products and then batching and everything.

00;25;57;23 - 00;26;26;01
Jens
It's it's handled. So that means you you never need to do a, a data loader again. Which, by the way, one one of the biggest adoption blockers for, for teams to efficiently build good GraphQL servers, GraphQL backends is data loading. It's always something everybody new to the topic. They need to learn it with Cosmo Connect, write a schema compile it, implement the resulting proto.

00;26;26;03 - 00;27;07;17
Jens
Done. Okay, so that's the backend side. So on the backend side why why GraphQL. We we don't need it. But what we need is entities. So again entities. And then on the front end side there's like a big group of people who absolutely fell in love with relay and Fragments. And I belong to that group, big fan like I think like the triple D, like data driven dependencies defining your data requirements per UI component with a fragment, hoisting up the fragments, compiling them into one query per route, etc., etc. I think that's the right approach.

00;27;07;19 - 00;27;32;00
Jens
However, not so many people need that, and there are many API consumers who would prefer something different. Like for example, MCP doesn't care about fragments at all. We don't need relay, we just need to have like a query or like maybe we want an SDK. Also doesn't need like SDKs don't benefit from GraphQL. It's just overhead. Just give me an SDK.

00;27;32;02 - 00;27;58;23
Jens
So an SDK, ideally it's just kind of like a rest API or at least like JSON RPC. So that means on the left side of the router on the client side we could have GraphQL. We we we we could have MCP, we could have json, RPC or whatever. And on the right side we could have GraphQL. But we could also have gRPC or something.

00;27;58;26 - 00;28;26;07
Jens
So that leaves us in the middle with well if we don't always need federation then maybe we need to have a better term for for defining what this middle tier is actually about. And for me it's all about entities. So that's why I call it the entity layer. And from my perspective, the entity layer is extremely powerful. You have objects.

00;28;26;10 - 00;28;57;09

Each object is an entity. If it has a key. This key uniquely defines how we can find in our microservice architecture how we can find this thing. And the router knows what subgraphs to ask to get information about the thing. The router knows that we use the key to go to the subgraph, and the router knows from the subgraph schemas which subgraph has which fields on the entity.

00;28;57;11 - 00;29;25;28
Jens
So the entity layer is like a graph of types with unique identifiers. And these unique identifiers. They are absolutely amazing because what they give us is, we can use them as cache keys so we can stick an entity into Redis, and we can get it back from Redis through the name of the type of the entity and the, the, the, the key.

00;29;26;01 - 00;29;55;24
Jens
Or we can use EDFS event driven federated subscriptions or how we call it lately, Cosmo streams, where you have a Kafka topic and you get messages and each message contains a type name and, key. So it's actually, it's an entity. And so you have entities, you can access them from subgraphs, you can use them for caching, for cache invalidation.

00;29;55;26 - 00;30;15;05
Jens
Or you could even use like, cache, like backend cache filling mechanisms. You could say, oh, if something changes in the back end, you put a message on Kafka. The router reads that resolves the entity from subgraphs and sticks it into Redis. So next time a consumer comes there, they can actually read that right from the cache.

00;30;15;05 - 00;30;32;00
Jens
Like you can do like so many, so many things. And then if you build that entity layer, just ask yourself, if I'm not always using, GraphQL to, to access it, maybe. Yeah, maybe we just name it more, more generic. So I call it entity layer.

00;30;32;02 - 00;30;46;24
Stefan
No. Well said. And for all the viewers that we have guys, thank you so much for joining us today. We're kind of setting the record straight on wunder graphs direction and federation and where we're going. We just finished talking a little bit about the entity layer and its concept. The Jens is constantly bringing up and it makes sense.

00;30;46;24 - 00;31;09;01
Stefan
It's kind of exciting. And and next topic I want to talk about is gRPC. We hear this a lot. And somebody I wonder who said that we're pivoting into gRPC. I don't think that's true. The last time I heard or, you know, in our all hands, I don't think we talked about that. Can you help me understand a little bit?

00;31;09;01 - 00;31;30;10
Stefan
Like, why do you feel so strongly that the next generation of federation speaks gRPC? For those that might not be familiar, you might want to take a look at Cosmo Connect. It's a feature that we've released. It's really powerful, and we really believe that the next iteration of Federation speaks gRPC. So again, what do you think about that topic?

00;31;30;12 - 00;31;40;18
Jens
So,

00;31;40;21 - 00;31;45;15
Stefan
Jacob is going to put the meme here calculating, you know, like the windows the blue thing.

00;31;45;17 - 00;32;14;04
Jens
Yep. Okay. Like I said, with the entity layer, you have root fields in the graph and they are kind of like query like search fields. So they can have like search params and then they return a thing. All right. So these root fields you send them to a resolver and that returns a thing in the federated graph this thing is typically an entity.

00;32;14;06 - 00;32;40;13
Jens
So that means after the first layer of data fetching, everything else is entity calls. Like so you, you, you say oh I have product. And for this product with ID seven, give me other fields, give me reviews. And I'm not saying that for one product, I'm saying it for 100 products. So we need batching. There. Okay.

00;32;40;16 - 00;33;09;22
Jens
So if I want to efficiently batch those requests, why do I need to build a GraphQL server? I, I don't get it. Why why do I need a framework? And the thing is, Apollo created a situation where if you ever want to see any sort of innovation on the federation layer, what you have to do is you have to extend the non-existing spec.

00;33;09;24 - 00;33;39;12
Jens
So the by spec I mean you, you, you just document like two lines where you say, oh, here's the new directive. Nobody knows how it works, but here's the directive. Then you implement it in the router and then you implement it in all subgraph frameworks. And that means you have a huge lag. And oftentimes you can see that on the compatibility compatibility side of, of Apollo Federation, it can take years.

00;33;39;12 - 00;34;06;00
Jens
And then you still don't have support in all frameworks. So that means Apollo has a monopoly on owning what is possible in the federation layer. And, what we're doing with Cosmo Connect is we move GraphQL into the router, and we move GraphQL at build time to like the composition layer. So you have composition that gives you a schema and and everything.

00;34;06;02 - 00;34;41;11
Jens
Then we compile it into gRPC. And because we compile it into gRPC, the dependency on the subgraph layer essentially is just vanilla gRPC. So what that means is if we add a feature to the router, it is available to Python dotnet Java rust, Kotlin. Every language that supports gRPC, it's immediately available. If we can make an improvement, it's immediately available to everybody.

00;34;41;14 - 00;35;07;23
Jens
The second part is let's talk about the the request chain. And let's say you, you have a, you have a GraphQL request. It comes from the client to the router. The router parses the query, it normalizes it, it in lines, fields it in lines, fragments. It does all the magic, which is super expensive. So we have a cache for that.

00;35;07;25 - 00;35;28;21
Jens
And after all this magic is done we stick that into into. Yeah, into the into the cache. And then we make our subgraph requests. So now we know exactly okay we have a root field. And then we have subfields. So we do like entity calls and whatever. And when we do these entity calls we know we need to do batch calls.

00;35;28;24 - 00;35;57;16
Jens
Why should we now take the efficient like all the efficiencies we have in the router to generate text and send. Because GraphQL queries text send that text to the framework. And now the framework, the subgraph framework needs to parse the text needs to analyze it needs to normalize, it needs to validate, it needs to implement data loading to now efficiently resolve that query.

00;35;57;19 - 00;36;21;01
Jens
All this stuff already happened in our router and now you have to do it again. Why? All we need to do is we need to call a bunch of, resolver functions. So in terms of efficiency, something that is talked a lot about is how fast can your router be? My question for you is how fast is your subgraph?

00;36;21;04 - 00;36;47;21
Jens
Because in our case, most of the time, like in benchmarks, what people do is they use rust as the subgraph framework. But what if you have Node.js or Python or Elixir or something that is not crazy fast in parsing, GraphQL grows, so suddenly the router is good and the backend is actually your, your, your bottleneck. So that's one part of the story.

00;36;47;23 - 00;36;56;19
Jens
And to round off this monologue, this is my last point, Stefan.

00;36;56;21 - 00;36;57;20
Stefan
For now,

00;36;57;22 - 00;37;20;29
Jens
For now, but for now, yes. Cosmos connect is is available in two flavors. One flavor is you deploy the gRPC service as a dedicated service. So it actually is a dedicated service that lives somewhere. And the second shape, you can you can use cosmo connect  You deploy your subgraph as a, as, as a, as a plugin.

00;37;21;01 - 00;37;47;14
Jens
So it runs like a co-processor, side by side with the router. And if you run a subgraph as a co-processor, that means it's ultra low latency and it's zero overhead in deployment. So you're not deploying another thing. So now here's the question. So you have Apollo connectors where you put directives on your schema. And then it can do Rest APIs.

00;37;47;16 - 00;38;15;00
Jens
So with Cosmo Connect you have a plugin. And this plugin runs with the router. So kind of zero overhead. It's super cheap. And this plugin it's kind of like behaving like a subgraph. Except you don't need to know anything about GraphQL. You don't need to know anything about Federation. There's no keys. There's no directives. It's it's just pure gRPC.
