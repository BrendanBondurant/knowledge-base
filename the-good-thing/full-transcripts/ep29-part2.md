00:30:48:07 - 00:31:13:12
type: podcast-chunk
Viola
So we introduced that and it started creating this beautiful atmosphere of silence on a, on a
daily basis where only the relevant ticket would escalate and have introduced the correct
engineers for those particular queries. Things are simpler to resolve with a resolve within the
day or the next couple of days, we would jump on call screen share with customers.
00:31:13:12 - 00:31:53:07
Viola
So. So now the team working on the product is fully, you know, able to focus on product and
while still keeping that connection with the customer because they're not removed from
interacting with them, which I believe is also an important aspect of, working at this stage. You
want to keep the pulse from everyone on the customer, because it drives that, you know, the
empathy, the fact that we know world building for we know the real cases, we know the logos,
then we know where is work, you know, where is our work, making a difference.
00:31:53:10 - 00:32:25:06
Viola
And so, yeah, I think it's, it's an interesting stage. And, we're incredibly lucky to be in this, in this
moment of time with wundergraph, I think is one of the most I think I want to call it addictive
things about start ups, when things start kind of falling into place and you're able to look at the
next phase and introduce this sort of processes are actually making people's lives better,
internally in the company and, elevating product delivery velocity, things like that.
00:32:25:06 - 00:32:32:01
Viola
So, yeah, it's it's certainly one of the most addictive things about startups as well.
00:32:32:03 - 00:32:36:11
Stefan
Okay. So Jens. Do you want to add anything?
00:32:36:13 - 00:33:07:22
Jens
You know, I'm, I'm thinking all the time about the future of the company, like what is ahead of us
and what one, one thing I find crazy about startups is you keep accelerating and while you
accelerate, you have to you have to keep up building the road. So you keep stepping on the gas
and you keep extending the engine.
00:33:07:22 - 00:33:38:27
Jens
More horsepower, bigger tires, bigger gearbox, everything. But the road isn't even there. And
you know, it's it's it's such a crazy thing. It's it's always like a little bit of a whac-a-mole game
where you solve one problem. For example, you you solve marketing and suddenly you have a
sales bottleneck, and then you have a engineering bottleneck, and then you have a customer
success bottleneck, and you solve all of these, and then you have a marketing bottleneck again.
00:33:38:27 - 00:34:10:11
Jens
And you solve that. And I don't know, it feels like an it I don't want to say hamster wheel
because it's, it's fun, but it's, it's also super weird that you, that you, keep expanding and
expanding for the sake of expanding, but, yeah, I don't know. It's it's startups are are something.
But I can say so far it's it's really interesting how you keep reinventing yourself.
00:34:10:14 - 00:34:39:21
Jens
Like, if I think back, like, two years ago, we I never thought that I would be so strategic about
growth. Like, we just had, a founder meeting, and it's kind of like the first time that I'm, I'm
thinking, like, okay, like, on the high level, like, we can build pipeline here. Pipeline there, this,
this, that. And then Stefan goes like, yeah, but if you build this kind of pipeline, you need more
sales.
00:34:39:24 - 00:35:02:28
Jens
And then, if you build more sales, you need to think about customer success. And you some
variables you can just guess and to somehow have to figure out a framework like, okay, how
many customers will we add. And so like it's yeah, we're, we're in such an interesting time, to be
honest.
00:35:03:00 - 00:35:27:22
Viola
Yeah, I know we have great tools, you know, to be able to to forecast that, to be able to build
these models that now even, let's say, 20 years ago didn't exist now. And I always go back to
thinking customer success as a role only started existing around 2005 when Salesforce
introduced the title. But we know it's, you know, as a, as a function.
00:35:27:25 - 00:35:53:21
Viola
It existed in many different forms and many different roles throughout. You know, since we've
been serving software and, what I found fascinating is that now we're able to truly put a number
really quickly without having to spend too much resource on how many, you know, requests we
get from a certain customer, what is their tier, and how much time do we take to resolve certain
queries on a more strategic level as well?
00:35:53:21 - 00:36:21:13
Viola
We can actually also feed back into marketing and product. You know, like what's been the
interest of customers on certain topics and like we need we live in an age where we have so
many good resources at our, tooltip, you know, at our fingertips that we it becomes almost
easier to, to be able to deliver a good experience and also help the company harness that
information.
00:36:21:16 - 00:36:42:03
Viola
So yeah, I think whilst it can, you know, it looks like the hamster wheel is getting bigger and
bigger, I think we also getting, maybe better, engine for the hamster wheel and so on. So, so we
have some sort of support coming in with the right tools. And, I think we have a good stack as
well.
00:36:42:06 - 00:36:48:21
Viola
For this stage, I think we're in a good in a good spot, but, you know, it's always evolving.
00:36:48:23 - 00:37:08:14
Stefan
You mentioned an interesting point, though, like product and customer support. Jens is the
product guy. He's the one that leads the vision on the product. Me and you are kind of on the
ground getting the feedback. Jens is coming into the calls and everything like that. I'm curious,
like, how do we translate like customer feedback? Because we get a lot of it.
00:37:08:16 - 00:37:23:08
Stefan
How do you dig through it and find out what actually can go into the product? And Jens, and
how do you also differentiate from all these inputs from all these customers where one person
wants this, one person wants that, and how does that even align with your vision? Like how
does that work?
00:37:23:11 - 00:37:47:09
Viola
Yeah. To answer my, my, my side of the question, we started bringing in a lot of data to bubble it
up to the product team. So during triage, the tickets have things like customer says, you know, I
requested it, but now we're able to see the full bird's eye view of the customer, full of historical
requests that we've delivered.
00:37:47:12 - 00:38:17:15
Viola
We're able to add more information. We're able to also add a bit of that, qualitative insight that
you might get from conversations with the customers that, again, we have time to to capture
either of the, yeah, the context that we're having or via our weekly meetings, monthly meetings
and so on. So it's we're bubbling up that information so that product can do a better, you know,
an analysis of the what's available and then make a decision.
00:38:17:17 - 00:38:18:22
Viola
So, yeah.
00:38:18:24 - 00:38:43:22
Jens
Yeah. Jens. So we have this triage process. We currently do it twice a week. And it's, it's
actually it's a challenge to stay on top of everything that people look into and ask. And I think
one one, one part that really helps us if you can see patterns like it's not just one customer,
wants something, but actually multiple.
00:38:43:22 - 00:39:27:00
Jens
So you can see the, the impact, but you need to have the right kind of tooling that connects all
the, all the dots. So you need to have like the, the customer requests in the customer requests,
you, you need to, to tag like what they actually want. We bring this all together in, in, linear. In
linear we create those tickets, we, tag them with the customers, and then we can kind of see,
like the, the patterns, like one, one great job viola does is actually, figure out, well, what is what's
our duplicate so that we can see, okay, this is something that multiple people want.
00:39:27:00 - 00:39:57:18
Jens
And, you know, the the the easy answer to how I do my job is I have a feeling and I think, you
know, it's it is just like that, like, okay, if I have an idea where we're going with the company and
I, I talk to a lot of customers and they look into all these threads and read what happened and
try to understand what what they need.
00:39:57:20 - 00:40:30:04
Jens
And then, I don't know, I just put it together and then have my own llm in my head where I,
where I get a feeling for what is right and I, I cannot always tell. Like what? Like there's no
ultimate decision or something. But you, you have a vision as a company where you want to
unlock new markets because you say, okay, we want to expand our TAM total addressable
market.
00:40:30:07 - 00:41:04:04
Jens
So you you make strategic decisions, what markets you move into and how you accomplish that
with adding capabilities. And then you have customer requests. And you always have to think
about, is this something that enables one customer is it something that enables five, or is it
something that helps us build a bigger category? And you you kind of try to to level all these
things and figure out what is the, what is the right thing?
00:41:04:04 - 00:41:31:24
Jens
And, it's it's hard. And, you also have to think about the complexity, like, how hard is it to do? Is
it something super simple? Can we do it quickly? And what what is the cost of not doing it? And
will it have a cost? For example, just recently, we had a couple of customers after the one-of
directive was merged.
00:41:31:24 - 00:41:56:12
Jens
We had a couple of customers who said, can you support one of we have a very, very big
project running that, eats up the necessary resources to do the one of directive. So we were
thinking, okay, we can do one off now, we can do it in a couple of weeks. We can do it in a
couple of months or after the big project is done.
00:41:56:14 - 00:42:24:17
Jens
And we kind of figured out that we cannot wait until the big project is done. It's too long. It will
hurt the relationship with our customers. So so what is the point of waiting at all because we
eventually we have to do it. So in that case, you said, okay, it takes us one day and, we we just
do it now because let's make customers happy.
00:42:24:17 - 00:42:54:14
Jens
That's, that's enabled them and that's, that's the very. And you can't do that all the time and with
everything and, but you always have to, to consider the, the big picture and I would say I cannot
teach anybody what I'm doing. It's just you do it for some years you you interact a lot of with
customers and you, you develop intuition and yeah, we have different opinions.
00:42:54:14 - 00:43:27:06
Jens
Like, it's not me being a dictator. We have Stefan, we have viola, we have our CTO, and we all
sit together in triage and discuss like, this is something we do tomorrow or we do later and we, I
think we, we found a good middle ground in working on on vision. versus is working on enabling
customers and I would say, luckily, we are in a place where we were able to expand the
engineering team to the point that our capacity is really good.
00:43:27:06 - 00:43:57:08
Jens
Now. And also the product has matured a lot like we now have. For example, like a while ago
we did a very big pen test. We invested two weeks after the pen test. To fix a whole bunch of
holes. And, yeah, we invested so much. We are working very, very closely together with eBay
who test our router at the highest of the highest scales.
00:43:57:10 - 00:44:48:24
Jens
And, at that level, things that matter. This is, you know, sometimes it it really bothers me when
people post benchmarks and say, oh, our router is so and so fast. When you have someone like
eBay with 100 K plus RPSs, what you need at, in that kind of level in production is you need
observability, you need stability and these kind of things, these are not just empty words,
because observability at that scale means you have to fine tune the cardinality of Prometheus
metrics to the point where it actually works, because you don't want to scrape too much, but you
need enough data to properly observe what is going on.
00:44:48:24 - 00:45:17:12
Jens
And it's, it's it's a process of of fine tuning and these kind of things. This is what matters at scale
and not like, oh, we are fast in the benchmark or something. And, and some people, they, they,
they just tell a story about something that this far from reality like Federation at scale. It is more
than I can hammer a router with the same request with the high RPS.
00:45:17:12 - 00:45:26:03
Jens
There's so much more to it. And, I forgot the question, but Jens.
00:45:26:05 - 00:45:46:21
Stefan
Monologue. But speaking of questions, so there's one question from, somebody in the
audience, Mohammed, are you guys interested in decentralization? What do you think about
that movement? I'm not sure if I understand the question totally, but what I think it means is
basically like decentralizing the process of getting all of this support and how we bubble it up.
00:45:46:21 - 00:46:03:24
Stefan
And I think, Jens, you kind of touched a little bit upon that what the triage process is, that it it
kind of is decentralized. We have different input from everybody. We have from the CTO, from
the product, from the CSM, from, the customers and everything. But I think that the approach
that we currently do is what you said.
00:46:03:24 - 00:46:16:00
Stefan
It's kind of like on vibes, but also with the customers. But also we do have a North Star. We still
have what we want to envision the world for Federation, for APIs. Would you agree?
00:46:16:03 - 00:46:41:02
Jens
So I would say, I don't know what is the the, the, the term in English, but when you have multiple
powers and they have a shared, how do you call it when you have shared power like you have?
You have, for example, politicians and you have police and the power is, is, distributed. How do
you call this in English as a word in German?
00:46:41:04 - 00:46:43:05
Stefan
Democracy?
00:46:43:07 - 00:46:44:28
Jens
No, not democracy.
00:46:45:00 - 00:46:50:06
Stefan
Friendship. So somebody commented.
00:46:50:08 - 00:47:14:06
Jens
Anyways, well, what I think is important. So I'm, I'm, I'm the tie breaker, I would say so I, I think
somebody needs to have the last word because in, in, in a full democracy, sometimes you can
stall and you don't want to have that. So someone needs to be ultimately someone needs to be
responsible for the product direction.
00:47:14:08 - 00:47:46:29
Jens
And that that is me. Other than that, I think it's a super important that you have different powers
that pull in different directions, like you have sales. That's you, Stefan, you have Viola. That,
that, that represents the customer voice. You have me representing the vision and you have
Dustin, the CTO, representing the tech and like technical depth and we have to run it all of that.
00:47:47:02 - 00:48:25:03
Jens
And I think it's good to have like four powers who represent different points of views. And we we
try to find the middle ground most of the time we we can we can find that. And I think it's it's
super important that you have like, this kind of triage process that is not dominated by, by one
force. Because if we would just do vision 100%, it would mean I would even ignore helping
Stefan close the sale because I want to accomplish the vision, or I completely ignore existing
customers and they would churn.
00:48:25:03 - 00:48:53:08
Jens
And so yeah, and with Dustin, you can't just build everything because you can't create technical
debt. You have to run and operate it so that is the fourth pillar, I would say. And I like that we
that we have this triage process and we try to find like where's the where's the middle? And
yeah, it's it's not easy, but so far it seems to be working.
00:48:53:11 - 00:48:54:06
Stefan
I would agree. What do you think?
00:48:54:06 - 00:49:29:15
Viola
yeah I, I, I totally agree, I agree I think I think as I mentioned earlier, we are in such a stage
where we are always iterating, we are always evolving things. And six months things could look
a lot different or kind of similar. And you know, we take it from there. But I think what the North
Star is on top of our values and what we what we want to deliver is that being customer centric,
you know, I think what I've seen from everyone so far has been the great attention to the
customer.
00:49:29:15 - 00:49:52:14
Viola
You know how responsive you guys are on slack, but even on discord, all of that passion that
you have behind the product is actually passion behind the customer. So I think with that, you
know, having that in the mix means that no matter what process we decide to iterate on, that we
have the right motivation behind it.
00:49:52:16 - 00:50:18:19
Viola
And and I think it's a great, great asset to have because, yeah, yeah, there's, there's no other
there's not a really huge driver out there that can make a company succeed. But the desire to
really fulfill something important for a customer and solve the problem. So yeah, I think it's it's
working really well. And I'm sure we have the right motivation to evolve it over time.
00:50:18:21 - 00:50:23:02
Jens
By the way, the, the word I was looking for, it's, division of powers.
00:50:23:04 - 00:50:27:22
Stefan
Which you said a word, not words.
00:50:27:25 - 00:50:28:20
Stefan
00:50:28:23 - 00:51:04:14
Jens
Yeah. And, one, one question I have for for viola. So there's this ongoing theme of, people who
built AI things, or LLM things. They keep saying that we will have billion dollar companies that
have, like one employee or maybe less than ten. And I would love to hear from from your, from
your point of view, viola, because, I know that one very big topic for you is, is all around
empathy.
00:51:04:16 - 00:51:30:12
Jens
And like I, I have my take, but I'm curious how you think about building $1 billion company with
just AI and like, bots and agents and bringing customer relationships and empathy to the to the
table like, do you think that's even possible?
00:51:30:14 - 00:51:55:29
Viola
I mean, I don't think with the current state of or current state, it's possible to run a whole billion
dollar company, the single person, because simply put, we only have 24 hours. As a founder,
you, hopefully you're going to sleep a little bit of these hours. So making sure that you can, you
know, build an entire product, an entire support stack and figure out the financials and
everything else.
00:51:55:29 - 00:52:21:03
Viola
I mean, just setting up your payment, provider will take months. And to do that correctly, you
know, you can't outsource it to an LLM. And I think to be successful, you can't outsource your
thinking. And therefore you need to build things like, you know, you need to put the graft in and
you need to put the hours in trying to fully understand what you're trying to solve.
00:52:21:06 - 00:52:44:00
Viola
And even if you are, you know, a hypothesis is correct, you know, treated scientifically rather
than putting a problem into a machine and hoping that it will give you an answer that's somehow
correct. And, you know, iterate on that, because we know that it's not, at least for now. It's not
into the stage. Maybe in 15 years will be there, but I think now we have to put in the time.
00:52:44:07 - 00:53:06:29
Viola
And I think that's also where's the beauty of building business, where you can actually spend
time and figure the things that actually matter, not just for the customer, for yourself, for how you
are delivering things, have the full control of what you're doing, rather than outsourcing it
because it's missing are the fundamental, I think, human desires, you know, solving things.
00:53:06:29 - 00:53:15:08
Viola
You know, we are ultimately solvers and I think we can't lose track of that. Yeah.
00:53:15:10 - 00:53:17:07
Stefan
Yeah. Mistake. None like.
00:53:17:10 - 00:53:50:12
Jens
David. My take is not no. So very simple. My learning is the really, really deep insights the most
the best feature request. The, the most powerful insights. You get them by building a
relationship with people, getting them to open up, to almost befriend with you. And at some
point they will start telling you insights about their company.
00:53:50:14 - 00:54:12:17
Jens
And they they don't say like, hey, your playground is broken, but they, they are more like, listen,
Jens we use Cosmo. It's amazing. But we have we have this other problem in the company, like
it's it's so much bigger and you're very close. Maybe you can help us with this thing or with this
process. Or maybe you can automate that.
00:54:12:17 - 00:54:47:28
Jens
And, and and these kind of insights you cannot LLM bot your way to that you have to build a
relationship and you, you you and that works only like human to human. And then I think you,
you get to the point where, where it gets really, really interesting and oftentimes, you know,
people, they, they are not always happy when you have like, zoom meetings and then there's
recorders and stuff and, and sometimes it takes a bar and a beer to really figure out how people
tick and what, what is super important to them.
00:54:47:28 - 00:55:20:05
Jens
And, so I think you, you cannot replace, empathy with LLMs and you cannot replace the human
element. And so I think if you want to really be successful, build a successful company, I think
you need the relationships. So I, I don't believe in this in this whole thing of we llm everything.
We automate everything. I think ultimately, you want to talk to a human and, yeah, that's my non
take.
00:55:20:05 - 00:55:22:12
Jens
David.
00:55:22:15 - 00:55:38:22
Stefan
None. But, okay, so we do have to, wrap up since we were a little bit late, so we are at the 55
mark while I will ask for the last question, though, advice for the listeners, for people that want to
build out a customer support team like how we have in processes, what are some tangible,
actionable advice?
00:55:38:22 - 00:55:40:19
Stefan
I can give them?
00:55:40:21 - 00:56:07:08
Viola
Okay. So I would say, first of all, interview internally, have conversations with your team. How
are things going? How are how's the support process looking like? From the eyes of who's
running it, if you are not running it, just try to get as much inside because these are the people
that are on the, you know, on the ground, and they will be able to tell you exactly what friction,
what problems, what things are working really well.
00:56:07:10 - 00:56:37:28
Viola
So make sure to gather as much evidence as possible internally. First, try to be there when
customers are having calls with the team. And if you can't be there, sort of like, despite the the
poor support process that we experienced, you know, any note taker is a great opportunity for
you to walk back on this calls, look them back, analyze their the conversations and see what
kind of points of friction there are, the reasoning and the motivations behind her.
00:56:38:01 - 00:56:59:04
Viola
And that's can also be a great opportunity to highlight feedback to your team. For example.
Yeah. Ask for additional questions. You know, go a bit deeper in those questions. If they have
them with the customer and you want to get to a little bit of a bottom of the why. So those are
great. Opportunity and iterate.
00:56:59:04 - 00:57:19:10
Viola
I think that would be the third one. It doesn't have to be a huge process, you know, designed
and ready to go from the from the get go. You can do an MVP. You can iterate, you can, you
know, treat customer success a little bit like product development and figure things out as you
as you move along. What's working, what needs to be improved and constantly iterate.
00:57:19:10 - 00:57:26:29
Viola
It doesn't have to be a huge project project, but it needs to be evolved. So yeah, I would say
those three. What do you think?
00:57:27:01 - 00:57:30:16
Stefan
Jens. Any final thoughts?
00:57:30:19 - 00:57:58:09
Jens
I think it really helps when. So I'm a technical founder. My biggest flaw and Stefan is an
engineer okay. Next joke. As a technical founder, I think one of my biggest flaws in the
beginning is I. Well, I was very much focused on the solution, and I was in love with the solution.
GraphQL. Best tech ever.
00:57:58:11 - 00:58:20:05
Jens
Let's use GraphQL for everything. Talk to your database, talk to whatever. It's always GraphQL.
That's not so good. But what I figured out is it really helps if you build a startup. And by the way,
you can change your point of view over time. It's it's it's no drama. It's fine. But what really helps
is two things.
00:58:20:07 - 00:59:08:08
Jens
If you like the people who use your solution, I think that is really beneficial because it makes
working together much easier. And the second thing is, that you that you really enjoy solving the
problem and then solving more problems for the customer. So if you can build that relationship
and expand that relationship and if you as founders and founding teams and everybody like
employees, if you if you join the startup and if you actually enjoy solving the problem and if you
enjoy solving that for the people who have the problem, I think it makes your life super
enjoyable and it can only lead to success.
00:59:08:08 - 00:59:11:26
Jens
So yeah, that's that's my take.
00:59:11:29 - 00:59:18:07
Stefan
Well-Said. So we do need to wrap up, though. We have lots of meetings today. Viola, thank you
so much for joining us.
00:59:18:07 - 00:59:21:13
Jens
Stefan is making a lot of money.
00:59:21:15 - 00:59:35:02
Stefan
Basically we have lots of sales meetings today, so I do need to run. Ethan is a little bit early on
one of them, so he's taking that for me. Speaking of note taking bots, if you guys just saw pop
up in the slack, we had a customer reference call where somebody was checking out
wundergraph and it's quite positive.
00:59:35:02 - 00:59:51:23
Stefan
So viola, great job on setting those up with the AI notes. Even when you're not there, you're still
there, which is great. So viola, thank you so much for joining us. This is a fantastic episode.
Everybody. Enjoy your Friday. And I don't know if we're back next week, but the good thing is we
might be back next week.
00:59:51:26 - 00:59:54:25

Yeah I think we're back next week. With a guest right.

We have Eric Wilde coming up soon.
00:59:58:11 - 01:00:05:11
Stefan
Would you call him the what. What would be a good nickname for him? The advocate of APIs.
He's quite big in the API space.
01:00:05:13 - 01:00:07:27
Jens
He joined the company called gentic.
01:00:07:29 - 01:00:21:08
