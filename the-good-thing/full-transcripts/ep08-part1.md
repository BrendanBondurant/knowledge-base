00:00:22:11 - 00:00:33:12
Stefan
And we're live. I'm back. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good
Thing, hosted by myself, Stefan, and my co-host Jens. How are you doing today?
00:00:33:15 - 00:00:34:18
Jens
I'm good.
00:00:34:20 - 00:00:36:28
Stefan
Can't complain. I'm doing better than almost.
00:00:37:00 - 00:00:41:00
Jens
Almost weekend. Yes, this is true.
00:00:41:00 - 00:00:55:26
Stefan
It is almost the weekend for you. The day is just starting out for me. But, apologies, guys. If you
hear a little bit in my voice, I have lost my voice because I just got married last week, and so I'm
still recovering from that. It was an absolute blast.
00:00:55:28 - 00:01:00:11
Stefan
You can ask me about my wedding Jens, no? or we just go straight to tech topics. Yeah.
00:01:00:11 - 00:01:05:03
Jens
I forgot my script.
00:01:05:05 - 00:01:10:09
Jens
Ask you about the wedding. Yeah, I, how old are you now, Stefan?
00:01:10:12 - 00:01:12:20
Stefan
27.
00:01:12:20 - 00:01:17:24
Jens
27 Okay. And, Yeah. How was your wedding?
00:01:17:27 - 00:01:36:16
Stefan
Wedding? Good. Yeah, it was, like, more of, like, a destination wedding. So, like three day
celebration, which is, like, more fun. We had people come out and people have been texting
that it was just amazing. I've already been married, though, for a couple of months, so. And I've
also been with my wife now six years, so nothing's changed on that front.
00:01:36:17 - 00:01:41:12
Stefan
Feels the exact same. But the party was cool. I really enjoyed, see like, you know, my family
and everybody there.
00:01:41:14 - 00:02:08:07
Jens
Yeah. Well, what do you think? And in terms of, you know, if you if you think about the, the
relationship with your partner, how do you think like, how impactful is, for example, moving
together or starting a relationship or marriage or stuff like that? Well, how do you think about the
impact of such events on your life?
00:02:08:10 - 00:02:30:15
Stefan
Yeah, I think it's important. And, I can actually relate this to start ups because we talk about this
a lot. Is that, like your co-founder, when you're looking for a co-founder, it's basically like looking
for, like a partner. Same thing that you do in your life. And like when you move together or you
raise around together or you just go through significant life events together, it's really important
that you have somebody there next to you that understands you.
00:02:30:15 - 00:02:48:08
Stefan
And it's even better, though, if you guys are opposites, like a yin and yang. So me and my wife,
where we're completely opposites, we're yin and yang and I see the same thing and our
founding team is that where I'm weak, our founding team is, one of our founders is strong, and
were another founder is weak at something another founder can complement that.
00:02:48:08 - 00:03:04:19
Stefan
And so with these significant life events, it makes everything so much easier when you have
somebody next to you. And so Y Combinator is always saying like have a good co-founder.
They say, having a good founder, co-founder is a like a hack. It's the same thing in life having a
good wife or a good husband. It's a hack.
00:03:04:19 - 00:03:26:26
Stefan
You can handle any storm together. Having a bad co-founder is really bad. It's actually worse to
have a bad co-founder than not having a co-founder at all. And it's the same thing in life. Having
a bad partner is worse than not having a partner at all. And so that's kind of the way that I see it.
I will say, though, at 27, my wife has like changed my life in a lot of ways I've been able to focus
on startups.
00:03:26:26 - 00:03:43:11
Stefan
I've been able to focus on WunderGraph and then I'm able to just been kind of headstrong onto
this. And so if you can get married early, I really think, you know, have fun in college, but get
married early. It helps you put your head on a swivel and really focus on the things that matter.
00:03:43:14 - 00:03:51:22
Jens
Interesting. Very interesting. You also said you and your wife. It's like yin and yang, but you still
need some common ground like right?
00:03:51:25 - 00:04:05:17
Stefan
So we align on the values. It's the same thing like with the founders, like why did we want to
start a company and what kind of culture do we want to build? And so with my wife we align on
the values of like what we want of life, how we want to raise our kids, where we want our kids to
go to school.
00:04:05:17 - 00:04:24:27
Stefan
And so we align on those, well, we're totally different. Like last night, she took me to a concert
called Santigold. It's like reggae and I'm not big on reggae, but she loves reggae. But I really
enjoyed the concert because she took me. And then sometimes I take her to concerts like, Pura
Vida or like John Summit, which is more like electronic music, and she doesn't really love that,
but she loves that.
00:04:24:27 - 00:04:33:21
Stefan
I love that. And so we get cool exposures in life because we're different. But when it comes to
the values, we're rock solid and we align on those.
00:04:33:23 - 00:04:50:05
Jens
Do you, do you remember like on old computers with, with hard disk drives, like not solid state,
but but HDDs, you had from time to time, you had to de-fragment your disk. Were you born
when we did that?
00:04:50:07 - 00:04:55:04
Stefan
I think I was born, but I don't think I actually ever did that. Why?
00:04:55:06 - 00:05:21:22
Jens
No, I don't know. But when you were talking about the relationship between you and your wife, I
was kind of thinking, my wife, she she acts a bit like, like a de-fragmentation system for me.
Like, I think without her, I would be a much worse human being because I'm focusing, like, so
much on, on, on tech and work.
00:05:21:25 - 00:05:47:00
Jens
And I really need someone who drags me back to life. And so, like, hey, and take the kids, let's
go outside and like, I, I really love the family and everything, but I don't know, somehow
something inside me drags me to the to the computer or to my office, and I, I want to work on on
WunderGraph, and it's good to have someone in life who.
00:05:47:03 - 00:06:03:09
Jens
Yeah. Who who helps you to to realize. Yeah, we're still humans. We're we're we're alive.
There's not just work. There's something else. And, yeah, I, I think having such a partner, it's, it's
a, it's a very good balance.
00:06:03:11 - 00:06:19:01
Stefan
I would agree and I think like I was talking about this with my mom the other day, my mom was
like, wow. Like yesterday I was on a meeting from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. I'm so exhausted. And I was
like, mom. Like, I usually do that every day. Like I'm on meetings every day, helping customers
on board or getting new customers.
00:06:19:04 - 00:06:41:11
Stefan
But she's like, I'm so tired. And then I was like, I'm not really tired. And we kind of like talked
about it. And it's like when you find something that you really care about, you can work hours
and hours and hours and you don't really get tired because you care and you're passionate
about it. And for me, like lately, I'd probably say the last year and a half and a half, I haven't
even gotten close to burning out, even though that we're working a lot of hours.
00:06:41:11 - 00:06:56:03
Stefan
And I think one, it's because we're growing. Two, it's because I really enjoy what we're doing.
But three, I would put this is as like my garbage collector is that Sofia comes and drags me out
of the house and she's like, you're going to this concert. And I'm like, I don't want to. But then
she's like, no, you're going.
00:06:56:03 - 00:07:20:00
Stefan
And then I go and I'm like, okay, I'm really glad that I went. I feel refreshed, I go back into today
like the office. I get to do a cool podcast and I get to go call. But I would agree totally with that.
It's really important to have a good partner that understands you. And last anecdote on this is, I
had a friend, he started 2 or 3 companies, and every time before he started the other company,
he would have, the talk with his wife and he'd be like, I'm doing it again.
00:07:20:03 - 00:07:34:19
Stefan
It's going to be hell. We're going through war. I won't do it. I can retire if you want, but let me
know what you want me to do. And the wife was like, I know you'll never retire. You're going to
do it anyways, so I might as well be there to support you. But I agree with everything you've said
so far.
00:07:34:22 - 00:08:01:19
Jens
Yeah. also. My my wife is sometimes really helpful, to like, I don't know, I, if I, if I have, like a
very controversial opinion sometimes it's really good to throw it at your wife and not go straight
to the team or to the founders or to the public, like, did put put it through the wife filter.
00:08:01:19 - 00:08:31:15
Jens
They sometimes they are like, you know, like, Dustin and I, I was like Dustin, our co-founder and
CTO. He's, he really cares about tech and good architecture and I would say I also care about
tech and architecture. And obviously we're not the same person. So sometimes we care about
different aspects of the software and the architecture and this can clash.
00:08:31:17 - 00:08:47:03
Jens
And, sometimes it's really good. Before you have an argument with someone, just say like, hey,
what do you think? How will Dustin react to that? And then, this sometimes the wife filter can
really help.
00:08:47:05 - 00:09:03:15
Stefan
Yeah. It's like quality control. That's your QA is like, if I just go say this and it's like, let me talk to
the wife first. And no, I would totally agree. But, yeah, the wedding was fantastic. You know,
nothing's really changed in the personal life other than we had a great celebration. Family was
there. But, yeah, I'm happy to be back.
00:09:03:15 - 00:09:23:07
Stefan
Happy to be back on the podcast. And we got some exciting topics today. So Jens let's kind of
kick this off. You've been tweeting about this, but it's also been controversial. Like if you've seen,
Zig, the founder of Century, he's also been talking about it is that a lot of VCs are really not OSS
friendly, open source friendly.
00:09:23:10 - 00:09:48:27
Stefan
And one of the things that you brought up is how fantastic open source is for inbound sales. And
so let's talk a little bit about like our OSS inbound sales notion and like what you think about it.
Because a little context on it is that Zig said that OSS is good for VCs. This is the VCs point of
views for seed and series A, but around B or C, if you're not aligned with the VCs, they will force
you to flip the camp.
00:09:48:27 - 00:10:03:28
Stefan
And you've seen it with HashiCorp. Where is that? They flip the licensing because it they really
just saw it as a funnel. But for us, I don't see it just as a funnel. I think one, it's a philosophy but
also an inbound funnel as well. What are your thoughts on that?
00:10:04:00 - 00:10:07:22
Jens
Okay. That's a that's a big topic.
00:10:07:24 - 00:10:09:12
Stefan
Theres a lot to unpack.
00:10:09:15 - 00:10:37:15
Jens
Yeah. I mean, one aspect is in the, in the, one, one core part of, of the customer architecture is
customer router. And customer router, it's, it's serving the requests between client and
subgraphs. And it translates, all of that. And it needs a schema. So we need a schema registry.
So that schema registry and customer we, we call a, custom control plane.
00:10:37:17 - 00:11:21:06
Jens
And these two components, for example, in Apollo, the control plane, it's graph OS and it's
closed source, and it's just a proprietary service. And our control plane is open source. You can
self-host and run it. And the Apollo router is elastic license. And, our router is Apache. And so
let's say you work in a very big bank and, or you work in a, in a big FAANG company, and you
would like to federate something or you are interested in creating federated architecture.
00:11:21:09 - 00:11:45:00
Jens
And then, you know, the, the legal guidelines and people tell you like, hey, what's the license of
that repository? And you look at the license and you could use Apache, you could use like MIT,
but if it's something different, legal will simply say, we we cannot allow you to use this. So now
the the POC stopped before it began.
00:11:45:02 - 00:12:14:18
Jens
And the second thing is, like we are developers and one of our, our target audience, big target
audience for us is developers. And so, we know how we tick and developers don't like to sign up
somewhere just to try something out. And so one of the things we're, we're actually looking at is,
so you can already self-host Cosmo.
00:12:14:18 - 00:12:39:05
Jens
And even if you work in a, in a big bank, it's super simple for you to, to try it out and run it
yourself. And the second thing is we're even trying to making self-hosting easier. And this it
sounds counter intuitive because you could say, well, if we make self-hosting easier, are we not
making it harder for us to get customers?
00:12:39:08 - 00:13:05:20
Jens
Because like our our managed solution cosmo cloud? It's, if we make self-hosting easier then
then why would people sign up and do that? And the reality is. So first of all, the router is an
infrastructure component. And one of our main goals is that we want everybody in the
Federation space to use this router as a base.
00:13:05:22 - 00:13:31:00
Jens
And if you, if you want to to customize it, then you should be able to customize it. If you want to
build custom modules or something, do that. If you want to run it with our managed cosmo
stack, that is great. We love that. We love to to work with you together. But even if you don't
want to do that, if you look closely, we have built the router in a way that you can.
00:13:31:02 - 00:13:59:05
Jens
You don't need Cosmo. You can just take the router and point it to an S3 bucket. And in this
bucket there's the config for the router, the execution config. And then router works. And so
yeah, we, we believe that if you really want to build, the standard in an ecosystem, it needs to
be open source, because otherwise you have these legal issues.
00:13:59:12 - 00:14:29:12
Jens
And on top of that, it needs to be affordable. Like if someone wants to scale up and they have a
lot of requests, you need to have a solution that works for everybody. So like at super small
scale, it it should be affordable. And you should have good analytics. But also if you have like
billions of requests per day, it should be similarly affordable.
00:14:29:14 - 00:14:59:06
Jens
And yeah, we, we see with alternative products this value is simply simply down the line. And for
us I would say one, one of the, one of the most interesting observations we didn't think about
that's in the very beginning is, but one big observation is when you make it open source and you
have a really powerful managed solution with with value, with a lot of value added.
00:14:59:09 - 00:15:25:13
Jens
What happens is people in a big bank, they try it out, they do a POC, even without talking to you
because it's too complicated. They do a POC and then if everything goes well, they say like,
okay, POC was great. We we love your tool. We would now, do a POC with your managed
solution because we don't want to host the whole cosmo stack.
00:15:25:14 - 00:15:47:01
Jens
It's too complicated for us. And then they start legal process security validation and and all this
kind of stuff. And what is so cool about this motion is we didn't do any selling. It's really just them
coming to us and saying, hey, we we we love your open source router. We have set it up. It
works. We have a small project.
00:15:47:03 - 00:16:08:08
Jens
Can you now help us get into production. And that's that's the sales pro. It's not it's not top
down. It's it's it's it's great bottom up motion. That gets us access to, to super big companies
and, yeah, we're, we're super happy with that. And you see, there's a lot
00:16:08:11 - 00:16:27:21
Stefan
Not add maybe after. But I want to like just kind of dive deeper into it. So like full transparency,
like we did the same approach with the SDK. You remember it was fully open source, but why
like full transparency? We made some money off them off of it. It was okay. And then we try to
build a cloud on top of it.
00:16:27:24 - 00:16:46:26
Stefan
But Jens what's the main difference between why now with Cosmo is we're making 100 x more
money than we were with whatever with the SDK, but they were both open source. We kept the
same notion. And I'll never forget this point where when we were pivoting, we were like, Jens
was like, we need to make it fully open source.
00:16:46:26 - 00:17:02:24
Stefan
And we were all like, but we just did that. It didn't work. And he's like, trust me, we need to make
it open source. Just trust me on that. Well, why did you come up with that? Like you had that
thinking a year and a half ago, and it ended up being right. Is it the same intuition that you have
now too to make it even easier to self-hosted?
00:17:03:01 - 00:17:08:06
Stefan
And what was the difference between the SDK and Cosmo, especially in terms of revenue?
00:17:08:08 - 00:17:49:09
Jens
So, the SDK allowed you to define API dependencies, glue them together so you could say,
here's a Postgres database, here's a rest API, here’s a GraphQL API, glue them all together into
a single unified GraphQL schema, and then expose that as an API. Cool tool. Was a lot of fun to
build. Problem. The, I would say that the impact radius of the solution and that's it's like super
important concept impact radius of the solution is single person or single team.
00:17:49:12 - 00:18:21:07
Jens
This is not a multi team solution. And so if you want to sell to enterprises and you want to make
money, there needs to be more impact then single person single team like big budgets in an
enterprise. You don't have big budgets. For one dev can create an API faster. That is. No, it
needs to be something like all people across 20 teams.
00:18:21:07 - 00:19:15:04
Jens
They can work more efficiently together. Or they can. They can. Yeah. Build an API together with
Federation, for example. That, that that's one aspect. Okay. The this radius and the second
aspect, this kind of what we figured out is, you have solutions that are in the infrastructure
bucket and you have solutions that are in the collaboration bucket, like, customer router, it's
infrastructure and Cosmo Studio where you have schema checks, where you have, for example,
our playground with with as an explorer of the schema one, one feature we recently added in
the explorer, you can see if you need to be authenticated, if you want to use a
00:19:15:04 - 00:19:50:16
Jens
field and if it needs authentication, what scopes are required. So API discovery, sharing APIs,
sharing knowledge. Then we have the playground where you can look into query plans. You can
understand how how would the query planning work then? Other features we have in the studio,
for example, is our cache warmer, where we look into, what what are the what are the queries
you were using for the last month or so?
00:19:50:19 - 00:20:19:00
Jens
And then we build a top list of, of queries. And how long it takes to plan them. So we have that
as an analytics add on. And from this information we create, a top list of first, put this into our
CDN. And when you boot up a router or when the router gets a new config, then we warm up
the caches, reducing, the query planning time for the router.
00:20:19:02 - 00:20:46:01
Jens
This, for example, is a solution. This helped one of our customers go through a Super Bowl
event, where they had, traffic spikes. But thanks to the, to, to thanks to the, to the cache
warmer, they they didn't have query planning spikes because the caches were warm. So these
are like value add ons.
00:20:46:04 - 00:21:15:26
Jens
And it's it's super important that your managed solution has value add ons in the in the collab,
collaborative space, for example, one critical feature of of collaboration is if one subgraph
introduces a change, we will check that this is not breaking any of your clients. So. So that
means by having such a platform, you can now have many teams that make subgraph changes.
00:21:15:26 - 00:21:34:00
Jens
And nobody is breaking, existing functionality. So now more people can be added to creating
services. So that's a big collaborative value add versus one single team builds an API faster
now.
00:21:34:02 - 00:21:58:04
Stefan
Yeah, I think you're spot on with that. Is that a lot of developer tools. What they do is they they
try to solve a problem for an individual developer, but really the power is actually and when you
get it into access to teams and enterprises because they're collaborating across teams as well.
And I think you kind of sum up perfectly of like what the difference was between the SDK as well
as, between Cosmo and then on go.
00:21:58:06 - 00:21:58:19
Stefan
Can I add.
00:21:58:19 - 00:22:01:04
Jens
One, one example?
00:22:01:06 - 00:22:02:02
Stefan
Sure.
00:22:02:04 - 00:22:46:01
Jens
Prisma. So an ORM, I think Prisma for many years is trying to figure out the business model and
if you like, this is not something we make public, but we, we have like, like a product vision
picture, like, like our North Star. How the ecosystem of of WunderGraph should look like in the
future. And one key aspect is open source is good, but it's super important that an open source
component is embedded into a much bigger product vision.
00:22:46:04 - 00:23:16:10
Jens
Where there are other products that have that are in different categories, like collaboration, for
example, with, with, with much bigger enterprise impact. And so yeah, it you need to think like in
an ecosystem. And for example for us, Cosmo, it is it is one step like that's one one piece of the
puzzle or a couple pieces of the puzzle, but there is a lot more around that.
00:23:16:10 - 00:23:42:13
Jens
And then that's in the end, makes the makes this strategy work. But our understanding of the
market is that an API gateway, the goal needs to be to make it virtually free, like our long term
vision for federation routing is to make it more or less free. Like, okay, it will never be free. It has
a cost, and there needs to be a schema registry.
00:23:42:16 - 00:23:57:19
Jens
And there needs to be analytics because otherwise you cannot do breaking change detection.
So there will be some cost. But for for Cosmo, for the router and for analytics like our, our long
term goal is to to actually drive down the cost.
00:23:57:21 - 00:24:17:16
Stefan
Yeah. And I think it's a great model. And I think all successful companies eventually realize this.
But so you mentioned Prisma is maybe not the best example, but what are some companies, in
your opinion that do this really well? For me I think vercel does it great with Next.js, they made
their framework open source or free, but the value really comes from the collaborative platform
of Vercel.
00:24:17:19 - 00:24:25:16
Stefan
Neon also does a good approach on this. What are some good open source companies that
have kind of nailed down this approach that you like?
00:24:25:18 - 00:24:26:08
Jens
Yeah, I.
00:24:26:08 - 00:24:27:02
Stefan
I.
00:24:27:08 - 00:24:58:04
Jens
Like Vercel and I think Vercel also transitioned a bit, you know, if you if you remember like
Vercel two years ago, everybody was like, oh my God, it is so expensive. And the, the, the new
Vercel is implementing new techniques to drive down compute cost and everybody's like super
positive about that. And yeah. And then at the same time you can actually see that it's funny.
00:24:58:04 - 00:25:23:12
Jens
How do you see these parallels. So Vercel is looking at driving down the hosting cost of your
website. And at the same time they built these AI features that allow you to create designs and
other things. And what what is designing? At the end of the day, it's it's collaboration again,
because you have a website and you want to show someone like, hey, here's a new idea.
00:25:23:12 - 00:25:52:18

So back in, in and in, in collaboration and I think like, you know, in, in, in infra like something like
the router, it's, it's typically like low margin markets because like people have a lot of requests.
And then let's say you have like a social media platform of sorts, that means you have a lot of
free users where you need to make money and then compare that to a collaborative tool like V0.

You have developers, they are one of your most expensive assets. And you can you can give
them at like enhanced superpowers with AI. And so that is something where you're, you're,
you're happy to pay more because you get more value. But for the router for each request, like
billing per request, at least billing or if you're sole business model is to bill per request.
00:26:23:20 - 00:26:25:11
Jens
It's got to be tough.
00:26:25:14 - 00:26:45:00
Stefan
Agreed. And a little story that I had is I was recently talking to, like a procurement officer helping
them onboard on to Cosmo. And one of the things he said during the procurement is that, hey,
we're not buying like a slack or a zoom or a, what do they use? I think they use Monday.com or
Jira.
00:26:45:02 - 00:27:06:09
Stefan
And if you look at all those tools, what those tools allow is collaboration across the company.
Without zoom, they wouldn't be able to meet with remote workers. Without slack, they wouldn't
be able to communicate. Without JIRA, they wouldn't be able to organize the tasks. And when
you look at that, especially from what we've seen in the market, is that company's biggest
assets are their employees.
00:27:06:11 - 00:27:27:07
Stefan
And then the second biggest assets are the tools that they use to collaborate, especially post-
Covid in a remote environment. And infra is very tricky. You don't want to charge per usage, but
a little secret hack that we've seen is per seat models or collaborative tools. People are like,
yeah, that's fine. As long as we can collaborate and work together, that's totally fine.
00:27:27:07 - 00:27:39:22
Stefan
We'll definitely pay the price on that. And I think it's it's an interesting learning. It took us a while,
but when you look at it in hindsight, me and Jens are like, how could we be so dumb? It makes
total sense. Any final thoughts on that one?
00:27:39:25 - 00:27:48:01
Jens
You have this. You have this quote from I think, Jeff Bezos. Do you remember.
00:27:48:03 - 00:27:51:10
Stefan
Your margin is my opportunity.
