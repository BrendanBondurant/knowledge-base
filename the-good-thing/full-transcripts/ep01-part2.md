00:32:55:19 - 00:33:26:29
Jens
So the the the the big problem I think was so I, I actually wanted to build an app. So I didn't start
a startup or a business with the idea of creating a business. I started the startup with the idea of
creating an app, and that is the first big mistake you can make because you're, you're and this is
also, you see it everywhere, like, you see so many solutions today.
00:33:26:29 - 00:33:53:18
Jens
And they say, we're AI with something. So people are like, okay, I build something with AI that
that is ultimately it's the easiest way to, to mess up your startup because, you need to start with
the problem. And, so I thought back then that the, the big problem is that students don't have
access to, to good deals in the, in the city.
00:33:53:20 - 00:34:22:20
Jens
And I thought if, if we could connect shops and, and and or restaurants and, and and students
with deals, I thought that would be a huge business because we have restaurants and shops
and students and people with smartphones. We have them everywhere. So billion dollar idea,
right? It's it's very simple. And, the, the, the one thing I really liked is, programing.
00:34:22:22 - 00:34:57:00
Jens
The thing I didn't like so much is actually walking through the streets, going into the restaurants
and selling something to people. And, after a while, we kind of like, I mean, we we were
students. We didn't. Burn any any money, we we we were living at home. But after a while, we
had some, some, some pressure, because we, we needed to progress with, with the company
and it felt like we had like three K in the bank or something.
00:34:57:00 - 00:35:24:08
Jens
And, eventually it was running out, so we needed to make revenue. And so I had to go out, go
into the restaurants and sell them something. And when we started doing that, we kind of
realized we will never going to make it, because have you ever tried selling something to
restaurants or shops in the streets? Like it's it's the absolute hardest thing.
00:35:24:11 - 00:36:02:09
Jens
You want to sell them a subscription for like 25 bucks per month or something, and it's almost
impossible. And we kind of figured out how to sell this to like 30 people in one city with a lot of
students. So we kind of got it. We kind of got it out, but then we ran into the next problem
because we made an assumption that if we build an app and we give this app to the restaurants
and to the shops, they would take a photo of whatever deal they want to make and they would
post this deal like Instagram in our cool app.
00:36:02:11 - 00:36:29:28
Jens
Yeah, yeah, that didn't happen because they didn't. They were like, oh, I cannot log in. I need
help. Like my my camera is broken. Like we ran into so many issues and like just from a
logistics point of view, from a go to market point of view, we kind of realized, if you can make
this concept work in one city, you have to put like, you know, think about it like, like, like a
flywheel.
00:36:30:01 - 00:36:53:29
Jens
You set up a flywheel in one city. You put a lot of energy in to, to get because you have a
chicken egg problem. You put in a lot of energy to spin the wheel, to get shops to sign up and
post a deal. Okay. Then you have to go to the other side of the market and you get you need to
get in the the students to keep the flywheel going.
00:36:54:04 - 00:37:22:25
Jens
And then you really need to to hope that both students and shops find the whole flywheel so
attractive that they keep spinning this thing by themselves, which didn't really work. And the next
problem is you set up this flywheel in one city, and unfortunately, you cannot copy this into the
next city. You have to set up a whole new flywheel in the next city and spin it up yourself.
00:37:22:25 - 00:37:53:14
Jens
And from a go to market, it's it's not. I build an app once I scale it out and it's the same thing for
everybody. It's, it's it's an absolute nightmare. In go to market. Yeah. But it, it helped me to
program apps and websites and backends and yeah, I learned programing through this and I, I
learned a lot about go to market or not how to do it.
00:37:53:16 - 00:38:16:27
Stefan
And what I think is important about that. For those of you that don't know the story of Airbnb, this
is very similar because what jens had was a basically a marketplace. You need two people on
there, you need the restaurants, and then you need the college students. And if you do a little
research on marketplace apps, the only way they really succeed is if the company that's
building that app puts extreme effort onto one side.
00:38:16:27 - 00:38:39:06
Stefan
You have to have either the restaurants fully on it or the students, because once you have one,
the other ones will come. And what happened with Airbnb is they did the same thing. So they
opened Airbnb bed and breakfast, and they released the app and they saw that the, the
restaurants or the, the hotel people that were posting their pictures, that they were horrible, the
pictures were horrible.
00:38:39:06 - 00:38:58:02
Stefan
They were taken in with horrible quality. So Paul Graham told them, you need to do things that
don't scale. And so what they did is they bought tickets, they flew to where their customers are,
and they took professional photos and they put so much effort into making these look like, like
hotel quality photos. And once they built that side of the motion, people started seeing the
picture.
00:38:58:02 - 00:39:17:09
Stefan
They started seeing the quality. Then the other flywheel happened where the customers that
were looking to stay a places started to come. And it's exactly what you said, because they had
to fly to every single city individually, because one flywheel that works in Boston didn't work in
New York, didn't work in LA. And for me, go to markets on marketplaces.
00:39:17:09 - 00:39:36:29
Stefan
Apps are extremely tough. So you definitely learned a lot there, which was, hey, not only do you
just build the app and they come, which is what every founder thinks. It's like, oh, you know,
everybody has an iPhone. We just need to build an app and don't worry, we'll make $1 billion.
But I like that. And so shekels, you know, I met you were in college and then it ended up, you
know, shutting down.
00:39:37:01 - 00:39:45:12
Stefan
Where did you go next? Did you start another startup? Did you go into engineering? What
happened there?
00:39:45:14 - 00:40:09:28
Jens
So now I could program and, yeah, I, I, I found, a place where I could work, like, junior dev, but
very soon, I mean, I was still at this, bold statement phase. I know every, like, I build a startup,
like I'm a CTO, right?
00:40:10:01 - 00:40:31:20
Stefan
Basically. I mean, I went real quick. Funny note, though, is, Jens when, we were traveling for a
retreat and, they asked Jens, like, what is your occupation? And hands was like, I'm a CEO
now. But then you remember when you were telling me he's like, I felt weird saying, I'm a CEO
of five people because we were a startup.
00:40:31:20 - 00:40:47:27
Stefan
And that's the that's the startup thing that it does to you is like, oh, I built a startup. Therefore,
now I'm a CTO because of all the crazy experience that I have. And so you had this bold
mindset and then you jumped into it. And where was the first job? Was this at Tonline or where
did you jump into as a junior?
00:40:47:29 - 00:41:16:06
Jens
So the the the funny thing is, I think, so I had this junior dev job where they were paying me, I
don't know, 30, 40 K or something like by by German standard. That's okay. Good. At least back
then. But I after after what wundergraph failed. No, after shake failed, I was like, okay, I need to
to up my, my salary.
00:41:16:10 - 00:41:52:14
Jens
And I was thinking that I should earn like 60, 70 K or whatever. I mean, I was very confident, not
very experienced, but, but confident and and, Yeah, the, the, the company that knew me as a
junior, they, they offered me something I think 50, 60 K and I just thought like, that's, I'm worth
more, I'm, I'm looking around and then I found some, some other positions where they were
hiring for, like, a senior dev or something.
00:41:52:14 - 00:42:16:22
Jens
Like, I wasn't really, like a senior, but I was, I think I was good at, representing myself, like,
getting. Yeah. Kind of. I mean, you you just need to find a greater fool. Like, you're right. You
need someone who needs to fill a position, and you need to sell them the dream that we can
make it work and,
00:42:16:25 - 00:42:46:28
Jens
Yeah. No. So I, I think I found the position that they wanted to pay me, like, 75 K or something.
That was really good, actually. And, but I also applied for another position where they were
looking for, like, an architect. I mean, I, I really wasn't ready for that kind of job, but it was
exciting. It was interesting because I thought, okay, as an architect, I can have more impact, on
on more people.
00:42:46:28 - 00:42:54:25
Jens
And I can, yeah. And and, I felt like I should be an architect.
00:42:54:27 - 00:42:56:16
Stefan
So crazy.
00:42:56:18 - 00:43:25:07
Jens
I, I applied for that, and then I, I got hired for, like, 84k or something, and then two years later,
they, they promoted me to to be the, like, the, the engineering lead. So I think with like three,
four years of experience, I was the, the engineering lead of, I think 20 people and not because
I'm like extremely good or something.
00:43:25:10 - 00:43:50:05
Jens
I think I wore the right kind of clothes, you know, I had my suits and everything, and and, yeah, I
think I, I was, I was networking with the right kind of people, you know, a lot of energy. That's
actually, like career advice. A lot of engineers. They are so into their code, which is not helping
their career.
00:43:50:07 - 00:44:12:01
Jens
If you want to make a career, you need to network. You need to you need to dress up. You need
to talk to the right people. And of course, I learned a lot. I read a lot of books like The Imposter. I
mean, if you if you now know my career, it makes sense to have the imposter handbook
because I was the absolute imposter.
00:44:12:04 - 00:44:44:14
Jens
But I, I learned a lot, and, Yeah. And, that that was how I, how I, was the architect. And then
engineering lead and the the the thing that that got me, got me or that I got stuck with this, APIs,
you know, we we had, like, multiple teams, and we were building, like, a news website from data
that was coming from, like, so many systems.
00:44:44:16 - 00:45:17:22
Jens
So how do you bring together all the data from all the systems? And so I was learning about
openAPI and how you can write specifications and, and how you can design Rest APIs. And I
was I was really fascinated by the idea that we can we can really think about design and we can
help teams collaborate to bring data together and that's that's kind of yeah, it it really fascinated
me.
00:45:17:22 - 00:45:43:13
Jens
It was at a time where, where Docker Swarm was new and Docker Swarm was fighting with,
with Kubernetes. And eventually it died kind of. And it was also the time where GraphQL, came
out in, I think, what was it, 2008 or I, I don't remember GraphQL was 2015 15.
00:45:43:16 - 00:45:45:17
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. It's not like, yeah.
00:45:45:20 - 00:46:18:16
Jens
Yeah, 2015 makes sense. And yeah, I like GraphQL was really new. Like just one, two, three
years or something. And I, I really like the idea that, that we could use GraphQL on top of all our
data sources, and somehow just write a query and get whatever we need instead of, you know,
each time we we brought on, like a new data source, we had to update our REST API and we
had like a BFF pattern backend for front end.
00:46:18:18 - 00:46:53:15
Jens
And each time we had like a new data thing, whatever we needed, we need to to update this,
this BFF. And we had one BFF across like all all departments and it kind of like was our our
custom handmade federation, if you want to say so. And, yeah, I, I really got interested in the
idea of, of building like a, a GraphQL system or like a system in general, like GraphQL is
actually, like, not not like, I'm not so married to to GraphQL.
00:46:53:15 - 00:47:10:10
Jens
I like the idea of bringing together APIs and and helping multiple teams collaborate on on. Yeah,
getting APIs and data together. And that's that's how I got into all of this. What we're now doing.
00:47:10:12 - 00:47:30:29
Stefan
I think there's a lot to unpack there, especially for people early in their career, is don't apply for
the job that you're qualified for, apply for the job you want, like you went from being a junior dev
to you're like, definitely very bold. I'm going to apply for the senior role. But then you even saw
an architect role with only like 2 or 3 years of experience and you somehow got it.
00:47:30:29 - 00:47:54:21
Stefan
And I think you gave a really good piece of advice there is that so many developers and I've
seen this like with my friends, they're, they're amazing programmers, but what they really lack
on are the soft skills. And especially in a corporate environment, it is a ladder. And the only way
you can go up the ladder is by going around people being a joy to work with, networking, being
able to kind of present yourself in a way that's beneficial for the company.
00:47:54:23 - 00:48:12:09
Stefan
There's a lot of politics involved. There's a lot of sus choices you make. For example, hiring a
junior developer as a architect. But Jens, and you actually ended up, you know, doing a good
job at that role. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's also where you met be our COO and co-
founder, correct?
00:48:12:12 - 00:48:14:21
Jens
Yes. So that's actually right.
00:48:14:24 - 00:48:38:04
Stefan
And there's actually a super funny story, which, I want to share is that Jens and I a lot in our
sales calls, we fight with, build versus buy. We get Jens in the past, we get a very smart senior
who thinks he knows everything. That thinks he can build himself a whole Federation test suite.
And I don't blame him because somebody told me this is that it's cool to build Federation tools.
00:48:38:04 - 00:48:59:03
Stefan
It's cool to build high performance gateways. It's cool. And when you work at a big company that
does photos or something that like, is built for consumers, the developers don't care about that.
They want to build cool stuff and Jens, at the time of T online, I think this is so funny, is that
AWS was kind of up and coming and you were like, no AWS.
00:48:59:03 - 00:49:11:15
Stefan
So we're going to do it on bare metal, right? Walk us through that decision and what you learn
from there that that now you use in your build versus buy, use cases when we use developers.
00:49:11:17 - 00:49:40:22
Jens
We, we actually made two absolute terrible decisions. So one one decision was so we we the
historically the company had a data center like for whatever reason, like not not an entire data
center. But I think we had like, 20 or something racks in the data center where we had like very
big machines with 200 gigs of, of memory.
00:49:40:24 - 00:50:14:01
Jens
So it was very clear, if you have this stuff and you're, you're it's on a lease, then you have to use
it. So the first actual decision we made this we we built up a team to run our own Kubernetes
platform on bare metal. And that makes a lot of sense, because if you are, an online news
website, the most important thing you should be concerned about is how do I run my own
Kubernetes cluster?
00:50:14:03 - 00:50:43:29
Jens
That's so obvious because, all your customers, they every morning they open the website, they
want to see the news. And this isn't only possible with your own Kubernetes cluster like just
using AWS, just outsourcing the hard things and focusing on how could you make news better.
That would be such a boring thing, but building your own Kubernetes cluster on bare metal that
that's exciting, right?
00:50:44:05 - 00:51:15:25
Jens
And we we could spend so much time and it was so much fun. We built our own CI CD pipelines
like even I have a contribution as a repository from from from Azure. They have like a thing
where you can run your own CI like CI, CD runner on Kubernetes with GitLab. So we had
obviously we had our own self-hosted GitLab because you, you would not use something like
GitHub.
00:51:15:25 - 00:51:41:15
Jens
You you run your own GitLab with your own database. So we had our own Kubernetes with
GitLab runners on our own, Kubernetes on bare metal and everything, and our own data center.
And yeah, it was a lot of fun, but we didn't do much for the for the business. And, that that's
that's a typical corporate thing.
00:51:41:15 - 00:52:06:28
Jens
You know, you you have developers. They are very far away from, from from the customer like
our we had like a two sided marketplace. We had the, the people who want to see the news.
And we had the advertisers who want to put, advertisements on the news website. That is what
we should be concerned about. We should be concerned about how can we make the website
faster?
00:52:07:05 - 00:52:30:11
Jens
How can we make the offerings on the website better to attract more users? And how can we
build better systems for advertisers to to make more money to address the right people and to
to show the right ads for the right people? Because if you're like 20 years old, you you don't
need like, things for 60 year old.
00:52:30:11 - 00:53:01:22
Jens
So something that that should have been things we should be concerned about. But we didn't
care about that. We cared about our bare metal. And the other thing is, we we if you are a news
website, you need a content management system. And, we did, a very thorough, thorough
market analysis. And we figured out that there's absolutely no content management system that
can, satisfy our requirements.
00:53:01:25 - 00:53:29:19
Jens
And obviously, we had to build our own content management system. And, I mean, I built I built
shake, an app where you can shake your phone, and it had, app and the front end and the
backend, so I can I can also build my own content management system. And so we had, a team
of couple of people and we, we figured out the requirements, of how to do that.
00:53:29:22 - 00:53:59:05
Jens
And, yeah, alongside with our bare metal Kubernetes, that, that was a very enjoyable time until
the pressure of the business side came, came to a point where it really was clear, like, we we
wouldn't figure it out. And, Yeah, eventually I, I left that that shit show. But it's, I wouldn't say it
was just me like that.
00:53:59:06 - 00:54:13:03
Jens
There were other clueless people involved, but I think I was, How do you say that? I was very
good at convincing other people of doing the wrong things.
00:54:13:05 - 00:54:34:26
Stefan
I mean, you also got yourself a job as an architect, as a junior, so I could definitely see that. But
definitely makes sense. But, there's so much to unpack here because it's so important is that,
like, I'm not even saying this as to sell WunderGraph Cosmo, but I understand why developers
want to build it. Like I said, gateways are cool, Federation solutions are cool.
00:54:34:28 - 00:54:55:09
Stefan
CMSs are cool. Running your own, on bare metal. That's cool. But the thing is, is when you left,
you kind of left a little bomb as well, because now what do they do with and we see this all the
time, is that somebody wants to build their own solution halfway through. They don't even
understand the complexity of it.
00:54:55:09 - 00:55:10:18
Stefan
They don't see all the use cases that they could. There's no way they could have seen because
they've never done it before. And then halfway through, they just leave and they leave it with the
team that's left there, and they have to pick up the scraps versus just using a vendor. And so I
think you learned a lot of valuable lessons there.
00:55:10:18 - 00:55:28:28
Stefan
And we and we always use the story when we talk with customers that like go ahead, try and
build it yourself. But here are the things that you might run into. There's also issues that we don't
even know yet. Now we're running into now with building this. But you should always, always,
always when you're looking at build versus buy, take it very seriously.
00:55:29:00 - 00:55:32:04
Stefan
And I think that's an important lesson there. And we are. Can I add.
00:55:32:04 - 00:55:33:05
Jens
Something.
00:55:33:07 - 00:55:36:05
Stefan
Of course. Go ahead.
00:55:36:07 - 00:56:05:09
Jens
I think if you have a few years of experience, the the most important learning you have to make
is in this build versus buy that often times engineers convince management that they can build
something because they want to build this, not because they know how to build this, and also
not because they understand that building it would actually benefit the business.
00:56:05:11 - 00:56:09:16
Jens
And I think.
00:56:09:18 - 00:56:33:16
Jens
I think if you want to be, a really good engineer, what you should be doing is get close to the
head of product or to the to the product owner or whatever team you're assigned to. Get close
to those people and try to understand the vision of your product. Like what are what is your
company concerned about?
00:56:33:18 - 00:57:05:08
Jens
Get close to your customers, understand what they are doing, and work on these kind of
projects. Projects that have like real customer facing like ARR impact things and like building a
Kubernetes on top of bare metal or building our own, our own content management system.
These were not things that had, like this impact on the business.
00:57:05:08 - 00:57:38:07
Jens
These were things that we we saw like, that's cool. We want to do this. And, and I think like
often times build versus buy is completely misled by inexperience. And I think it's so important to
get either you have this experience in-house or you get an external consultant who has built a
content management system or like, you know, if we if we make it specific in terms of federation.
00:57:38:09 - 00:58:18:26
Jens
So, we are we are a very big team working on, on Cosmo for more than a year now. I think how
long is it? Yeah, more than a year, a year and a half or something. And, our backlog is full. So
many things we can improve upon. But we have also built this huge knowledge base and
internal understanding of what is federation, how does it work and what's other things, are there
to come in the future and the, you know, the, the typical pitfall you run into is you're like, oh, I
look at Cosmo, it does too many things.
00:58:18:28 - 00:58:52:29
Jens
It's too big. I don't want this kind of big thing. This should be very lightweight. I, I just need a
router and a schema registry. That's what you think on day one. And then like, couple weeks
later, you're like, okay, but we need this one extra thing, and then a week later we need this
other extra thing. And then over the course of a year, you build the, the, the absolute worst copy
of Cosmo, and you don't end up with, with the better or bigger or anything.
00:58:52:29 - 00:59:17:11
Jens
It's it's just garbage. Because the problem is you can't just look at something like, I don't know,
big content management system. And you're like, oh, it's too complex. It does too many things. I
don't like it. We build the simpler one. This is never going to happen because then two weeks
later, business side comes product manager. We need this one other thing.
00:59:17:11 - 00:59:43:21
Jens
And then then you add that and then you add more. And over time you realize, okay, our
architecture doesn't support that. If you're a vendor and you sell a federation platform, yes, of
course you need to have the expertise. You should be building that thing. But on our end, we're
relying on other partners. We have tools like like Linear.
00:59:43:22 - 01:00:05:11
Jens
We we have a partner, for infrastructure, for hosting. And there's. We don't do bare metal. We
have someone who who does that for us, who abstracts it away. And, really the most important
thing for a developer. Focus on your customer.
01:00:05:13 - 01:00:23:07
Stefan
I think that's huge. And, I just want to re-emphasize that that if you're in your career early, kind of
get away from the code. And I had this experience at my last job, so, they, they were asking me
to do these tickets, and I was just wondering, like, who actually asked for these? And I asked if I
could talk to the customers.
01:00:23:09 - 01:00:43:15
Stefan
And the team just kind of took a step back and they were like, why do you want to talk to the
customers? And I think if you're early in your career and I think one of the best thing about
working, at Wunder Graph is how close you actually are to the customer. And if you can find a
job where you're close to customers or what Amazon does is that they put, everything single
engineer on customer service, I think at least once a month.
01:00:43:18 - 01:01:01:15

I think that's a really good place to be because building is fun, but building for your customers is
what's important and actually is more fun because you get feedback, you get joy from them
using it. And I think, Jens, you taught a very valuable lesson there, especially if you're early on
in your career, is look at what you're building and look at who you're building for.
01:01:01:18 - 01:01:28:12
Stefan
I think that's a crucial differentiator, and we are almost at time. So what I'll do is I'll ask one final
question and what we'll do next week as we're going to be doing this every Friday at 9 a.m. is
we're gonna do part two of Jens, which is he joined TYK, which was this new and hot startup in
the API management space, and he basically led them to a series B by building out their entire
GraphQL platform and creating what is the catalyst of WUnderGraph Cosmo, which is GraphQL
go tools.
01:01:28:14 - 01:01:49:29
Stefan
It's what our router is powered by. It's where we met Sergei, our amazing first engineer, actually,
David. And it just kind of led to where Wunder Graph Cosmo is, but Jen's, first of all, your
background is amazing. Like, I, like I told you this before the podcast, I think people really can
learn a lot. There's a lot of lessons from your background, but not as a CEO, but as a developer.
01:01:49:29 - 01:02:15:21
Stefan
What are the most important advice that you think? You've already given us some gold nuggets,
but things that maybe a mentor told you that changed your career path or a lesson that you
learned? Not like from the bare metal. Maybe something else that you would give to junior
developers, senior developers, or anybody that wants to go from junior to architect with one
year of experience.
01:02:15:23 - 01:02:49:04
Jens
So one thing I mentioned earlier, it's it's the fundamentals. If you don't understand some
something go very deep and until you have clarity, I think it really helps you to not feel like an
imposter. Another very important thing is, and this is actually even I think it's it's even more true
in the, in the age of AI, you know, a lot of developers or young developers, they might be asking
themselves, should I learn to program?
01:02:49:06 - 01:03:28:11
Jens
And there's this, this, this guy from from Nvidia, I think the, the CEO and I, I think he, he said
something like, we we shouldn't be learning to program or something along these lines. Which
begs the question, what really is programing and if you think about programing, for me,
programing is understanding what the customer needs and turning these business
requirements, turning them into a product.
01:03:28:13 - 01:03:58:01
Jens
And it doesn't really matter if I write prompts and telling an lllm to do that, or if I write code,
because if you think about like prompting or prompt engineering or whatever, if you want to have
a working product that works reliable reliably for a customer, even if you do that with llms and AI
or whatever use, you somehow really have to narrow down what this thing does.
01:03:58:03 - 01:04:24:18
Jens
So in a sense, even if you just use AI and prompts, you have to be very explicit about the
description of what the thing should do. So in the end, what's an LLM really is, well, what's an
LLM? What in a, what programing really is, is you figure out business requirements and you turn
that into a product.
01:04:24:21 - 01:05:11:12
Jens
And for me, and I think this is something that the young programmers should look at, for me, it's
not so important to actually write the code. Like the older I'm getting, the the less I'm actually
interested in writing code, because it's it's a lot of work and I'm lazy. But, at the end of the day, I
think what programmers really are, are and then a lot of, like, project managers and other
people, I think they will actually go away because what you really need to be able to do is take
customer requirements, turn them into business, and you can build such a such a strong career
in understanding business requirements
01:05:11:12 - 01:05:38:10
Jens
and turning them into products. And, I think that's that's what I would focus on. I would always
try to be very close to to the product, very close to the customers. Yeah. What what what other
advice? Understand programing languages. Well, one thing that really helped me is built my
own parsers and lexors and AST and other things.
01:05:38:12 - 01:05:46:14
Jens
I did this for GraphQL because there wasn't like the tooling. But the the good thing is.
01:05:46:17 - 01:05:48:26
Stefan
There it is. I was wondering when I was going to come.
01:05:48:29 - 01:06:11:18
Jens
The the good thing is, if you learn how to write the parser and everything, you you at some point
you you understand how programing in general works like, you know, you have text, you
tokenize it, you give it to some compiler and it does ast things and then bytecode, and then you
have like a vcm something bytecode execution. Bam.
01:06:11:18 - 01:06:43:09
Jens
Like it's, it's actually not so hard to implement your own programing language. It's a lot of fun.
You can learn a lot from that. Ultimately, you know, as a programmer, if you if you want to make
a good career, I think, one one very important thing is, is, you need to get along with other
people like wundergraph it it it doesn't it wouldn't exist if we were not such a great team like we
have.
01:06:43:15 - 01:07:15:19
Jens
You who who's, person that that is very good in socializing. You you can you can interview other
people. Very well. You can talk to other people very Well, you have a cool dog. And, it's true.
You you need someone who who does the the background work, like contracts and everything.
And then if you look at what what we have built, we have some amazing, devs from, from India.
01:07:15:22 - 01:07:44:17
Jens
We have someone who figured out how to do composition. We have someone who figured out
how to do query planning all these kind of things. I think if you if you want to build, you know,
there's this proverb, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. I would I
would slightly rephrase it, then say, if you want to build a successful startup, you just need a
bunch of people.
01:07:44:19 - 01:08:12:09
Jens
If you want to build a successful project, even at a corporate, you need a bunch of people. You
cannot do it with one person. You need five, maybe ten. Maybe the project needs 20 people. So
one thing if you ever want to be part of a successful project, you need to be a person that other
people like to work with because you, you you don't want to be the the douchebag that
everybody hates and nobody wants to work with you.
01:08:12:09 - 01:08:40:00
Jens
And and, that's that's very hard. So somehow figure out how can you collaborate and work
together with others. And that's that's ultimately where we're also coming back to what we're
currently doing at wundergraph. We're focusing on on collaboration because I think, a very big
thing in tech is we need to help people to collaborate and work together.
01:08:40:02 - 01:09:03:22
Jens
And, Federation is a great foundation to enable collaboration across teams, build platforms
where multiple teams can work together on APIs, can can discuss, API schemas and, how they
want to make changes and all these kind of things. And that's, that's that's where we are.
01:09:03:24 - 01:09:25:04
Stefan
Yeah. And I think it's a great way to end the episode. So a little hint of where we're going
towards in 2025. Jens. As always amazing. Co-host I'm excited for the next episode. So next
episode, next Friday at 9 a.m.. We're going to be talking about Jenssecond half of the journey,
which was tyk, some fun stuff that we went through in the early days, raising money and where
we are currently going.
01:09:25:04 - 01:09:40:00
Stefan
And I just wundergraph also to kind of talk a little bit about like the old product us almost dying.
There's a lot of cool stuff that happened in the past year, and I'm really excited that we brought
this podcast back. So guys, thank you so much for everyone who joined us. This was the good
thing. Hosted by Stefan and Jens.
01:09:40:00 - 01:09:58:14
Stefan
We'll be doing this every Friday at 9 a.m. eastern time, I think 3 p.m. Central European time. I'm
kind of good at timezones now. And, Jens, thank you so much. One final note this podcast will
be clipped, and so you'll be seeing, some snippets on our social media. So LinkedIn and Twitter.
So feel free to interact with those.
01:09:58:14 - 01:10:10:22
Stefan
And if you guys have any other podcast episode suggestions, things you guys want us to talk
about, feel free to ping us directly on LinkedIn or Twitter. But really excited to kick this off in
2025. So thanks, Jens. Any final words? Anything like that?
01:10:10:24 - 01:10:14:21
Jens
The the good thing is we're back next week.
01:10:14:23 - 01:10:21:17
Stefan
I love that that's how we're going to start ending every episode. So thanks everyone. Jump.
