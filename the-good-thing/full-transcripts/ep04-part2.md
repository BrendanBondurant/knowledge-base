00:39:37:19 - 00:39:38:27
Stefan
This is a.
00:39:38:28 - 00:40:09:17
Jens
Rabbit running around. It's it's funny. I don't know what it's doing, but. Okay. Yeah. All these
things, we we have a blog post on the topic on normalization. We will soon release another blog
post on on the cache warming. But yeah, back to the original point. This feedback loop
customer comes with the problem. You discuss it and then the close interaction we have like
weekly or bi weekly meetings with our customers, and then the screenshot.
00:40:09:19 - 00:40:11:06
Jens
That's why we do it.
00:40:11:08 - 00:40:32:08
Stefan
But so like my two points, while you were going on your little monologue. Yeah, look at that. You
need a water break. No, jokes aside, so, like, caring. And I want to tell two stories. One is we
recently got an application from a candidate for a position that we don't even have. Like, we
don't even have this position.
00:40:32:11 - 00:40:52:02
Stefan
But he went and he demonstrated, like, why he would be a good asset to the company. He
wrote this giant long email of the things that he would own, the things that he would create and
how passionate he is about it. And then he actually went and took a bunch of our videos and he
clip and he's like, this is how I envision you guys would do it.
00:40:52:08 - 00:41:05:27
Stefan
So we're not even hiring for like a content creator. But he got mine, and Jens attention to the
point that we were talking about him for two days, like, wow, like this type of passion and this
type of care and you can see that people, when they care about something, how much different
they are to work with.
00:41:05:27 - 00:41:23:20
Stefan
And when you care about something, it's what makes working at a company a superpower.
Because if the company truly cares about the problem that they're solving, you feel like you can
rely on them for anything. And one small antidote that I had is this was like a life lesson that,
like, completely changed my mind when I was in college.
00:41:23:22 - 00:41:38:16
Stefan
I just signed to play college soccer. I felt like a hot shot, you know, like I'm going to a school that
costs 90,000 a year, and I'm going for free. And, during the winter break, my mom was like, you
need to get a job. And I was like, mom, like, I'm going to school for free. She's like, you need to
get a job.
00:41:38:19 - 00:41:55:27
Stefan
So she gave me a job. I got a job in a restaurant for like two months. And I was like, oh, like,
why do I need a job? Like, I'm a college soccer player. I go to college for free, I'm a big shot.
And, they gave me a job as a, like a bar hand or like, like basically just helping out in the
restaurant cleaning stuff.
00:41:55:29 - 00:42:08:12
Stefan
And, one of the managers was like, hey, can I see you? And I was like, yeah. He goes, this plate
isn't really that clean. Neither is that one, like, what's going on? And I was like, oh, come on,
man. Like it's just to play it like, who cares? And he's like, let's go outside. And he pulls me to
the side.
00:42:08:12 - 00:42:24:12
Stefan
He's like, listen, I understand your college soccer player. I understand like, you know, this to you
is a small task, but he's like, I care about this. This to me is my college soccer. This to me is
being on the field. And he's like, I care. And he's like, I'm going to tell you something. And like,
maybe you'll listen to me.
00:42:24:12 - 00:42:42:23
Stefan
Maybe you don't. But I love this. This to me is my passion. And he's like, when somebody
comes in and they don't care. And that reflects badly on me. It hurts me. And he's like, for me,
what's most important is that how you do anything is how you do everything. So he's like,
hopefully that helps you as a lesson.
00:42:42:26 - 00:42:58:21
Stefan
And I remember that's smacked me in the face. I was like, Holy crap. Yeah, he's right. Like
something that I care about might be completely different from what he cares about. But that to
him was his college soccer. And it's the same thing that I see at Wunder Graph is that we hire
people that truly care about their whatever it is.
00:42:58:21 - 00:43:17:03
Stefan
You know, Dustin with his telemetry pipelines, David with composition is that they actually care
and they don't just put out crap is that they put out the best of their ability because they
genuinely care about the problem they solve. And so for me, that's what I like about Wunder
Graph. And then second, let's go back on the the customer feedback.
00:43:17:03 - 00:43:40:01
Stefan
So, DeLeon founders, fund guy, he said you can't ab way your your way to success like billion
dollar companies are started because somebody has a crazy vision and they're like a train.
They just go they're Elon Musk with SpaceX. He's like, I want to commercialize private space
travel. He didn't ask for feedback from customers. He just did it.
00:43:40:04 - 00:43:53:25
Stefan
Same thing with Tesla. Do you think that they kind of listen to the customers with the car like,
hey, can we fix this handle? Can we do this? Or was it just, I have a vision, I have the money
and we're going to execute. I'm not going to listen to everybody. Like how do you balance that
as a founder?
00:43:54:00 - 00:44:09:21
Stefan
Like how do you balance like the vision that we have for Wunder Graph, but also all the
feedback that we're getting constantly customers, because if we just listened all the time to the
customers, we would go this way when when the vision is we want to go that way.
00:44:09:24 - 00:44:42:27
Jens
That's a very good question. Sometimes people ask us to to solve a problem. And one one of
the, I would say one of the traps you can, you can get yourself into is when customers come to
you and ask you to build a solution like, can you build me this? Can you like I need this specific
solution.
00:44:42:29 - 00:45:07:29
Jens
And the problem with this is most of the time it's not that the customer is wrong. The problem is
the customer. They typically they work in their own domain. And what we do GraphQL federation
is for them a little bit like an alien thing. Like it's not their normal day to day work. It's just it's a
means to an end.
00:45:07:29 - 00:45:31:27
Jens
It solves a problem. But the real problem is e-commerce or something else. And so sometimes,
you know, you have very smart people in these companies and they think about their problem
and, they don't even tell you the problem. They tell you because they are typically not
entrepreneurs or not like, like founder mode or product people. They are engineers.
00:45:32:00 - 00:46:12:09
Jens
And the the biggest issue you have with engineers is they want to solve problems. So they
come to you and say like, hey, I hear solution. And I would say the most important thing at that
point is take a step back and figure out what is the problem they are trying to solve, and like,
don't. If you're a customer of us, don't misunderstand this, but sometimes it's actually beneficial
if we don't immediately react to what you want because it's also a test like sometimes it's it's
help.
00:46:12:10 - 00:46:41:28
Jens
It really helps if someone triggers twice or three times or four times or like how important is this
actually? Like, do you really need this? Or like who needs this? And then then there's this other
problem that, obviously, you know, the product. Like, we know Cosmo best, we know what the
router does. We know the capabilities of the of our control plane, the brain.
00:46:41:28 - 00:47:09:14
Jens
And, it's very often happens that the customer has like a problem, but they, they, they don't see
the, the wider scope and also. Yeah, we have so many customer relationships that we can see
we can see the patterns. We know how everybody deploy something, how they do federation
and we we don't see a problem once we see it like so many times.
00:47:09:14 - 00:47:47:23
Jens
And yeah. So summarizing I like, can you ab test yourself to $1 billion company? I don't know. I
think it depends. I think, I don't know in some regards, like in the short term period, I think it can
be very valuable to, to, to listen and to, to solve these like smaller issues on a, on a broader
scale.
00:47:47:25 - 00:48:31:25
Jens
I think it's, it's, you know, you can't just hire like a product owner who doesn't know anything
about APIs and how people use APIs, and then let them talk to customers, gather the feedback
and A B test to $1 billion company. I saw this in another company, so yeah, you really need to
like this is my role at at WunderGraph is to talk to as many people as I can, to listen to as much
feedback as I can and to, to to set like the, the, the long, the long term.
00:48:31:25 - 00:48:39:07
Jens
Course I think that's, that's a very important thing. And.
00:48:39:09 - 00:48:40:27
Stefan
I think you can build.
00:48:40:29 - 00:48:58:13
Jens
A good company with AB testing even if you're not like if you don't see more in the market. But
yeah, if you if you want to be really successful, then I think it's it's going to be very tough. Like
what what are your thoughts.
00:48:58:15 - 00:49:20:26
Stefan
So it's a good transition because like we're both first time founders. A lot of my friends are first
time founders, but I'm lucky. I also have friends that are repeat founders that have done like
really successful stuff. And what's interesting is nobody ever talks about luck like, oh, you don't
AB tested way to success. Oh, make sure you choose a big market and things like that.
00:49:20:29 - 00:49:42:12
Stefan
But nobody ever actually talks about how important luck is. And so for example slack slack is $1
billion company. It completely changed collaboration like things like that didn't exist before. And
you know how it came to fruition. They were using it internally. They showed a customer it on
accident and they were like, whoa, this is amazing. But they were AB testing a game company.
00:49:42:12 - 00:49:56:23
Stefan
They weren't even using slack. Slack became because it was just an internal tool that they were
using. And so what I mean by that is that, like people will tell you like, oh, you need to pick a
place with a big market, that's where you want to start your company, or you need to pick a
place where you're solving a huge problem.
00:49:56:23 - 00:50:17:22
Stefan
But like Google was two guys from college working on just search for fun, you know, Oracle was
because, Larry Austin didn't want to go start a company. Like, I want to start a software
company. Atlassian was he sent a cold email to his entire graduating class. He's like, who wants
to work on building software together? Another guy was like, me.
00:50:17:22 - 00:50:37:01
Stefan
Sure. And they just started working on software. And then the tools that they built to help
themselves, they kind of were like, like, this is kind of cool. We can sell this. And I don't think
people talk enough about luck and like ab testing. And I think the thing is about first time
founders is you don't think about these things because they're not important.
00:50:37:01 - 00:50:55:25
Stefan
You're just experimenting, you're trying things out. And so for me, I think it's both ways. Like you
can AB way your way to success. It absolutely is possible. But also like repeat founders, they
kind of saw some patterns. They were like, I don't know, maybe I got lucky the first time and I
and I created a market.
00:50:55:25 - 00:51:15:03
Stefan
That's why I was successful. I started in a very niche place, but I created that market. And so for
me, I'm 5050 on it. I also think like I actually Jens taught me this. He was like, all advice is B.S.
he's like one. There's survivorship bias. Like what worked for you might not work for me and
might not work for anybody else.
00:51:15:06 - 00:51:36:15
Stefan
And then two with advice is that it? It's not going to help you. The best way to do it is just go and
experiment. And that's exactly what we did. You remember we were with the SDK, we were
experimenting. We were learning things by some dumb luck. People kept telling us Federation,
federation, federation of federation, perfect timing. We pivoted perfect year.
00:51:36:18 - 00:51:57:02
Stefan
All these customers needed this 100% luck like calls were coming in. And then, you know, we
were always stubborn on the vision, the GitHub for APIs, the way we got there though, which is
also why I think fly and some other companies, sometimes struggle is be stubborn on the vision,
but be flexible on the details of how you get there.
00:51:57:02 - 00:52:10:18
Stefan
And so if you have to way your way to get there, that's okay. But if you need to be just a bullet
train to go through, that's also okay. So my thoughts are honestly, it's like life. You know,
sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
00:52:10:20 - 00:52:38:20
Jens
Took two takes on this. I think sometimes first time founders have a huge advantage because
they, they are inexperienced. This is. Yeah. No, the thing is, everybody says that's impossible.
That's not gonna work. First time founders have no fucking clue what they are doing. They don't
know that it doesn't work. So they just build it and make it work.
00:52:38:20 - 00:53:02:29
Jens
And it's it's, Yeah, that's sometimes that's that's the trick. And and the second thing I can say like
two words, first time founders or people who are trying to set up, a company trying to get some
funding. One thing you will, you will hit a lot is, is, rejection from from VCs. It's like just.
00:53:03:01 - 00:53:04:23
Stefan
Yeah, inevitable.
00:53:04:25 - 00:53:31:06
Jens
Yes. And then you you have to you have to put this through a filter. And that's, that's one thing in
particular. That's, that's I think it's, it's such a big mistake in how many, how many VCs think this
way. It's like they look at you, they look at the market like, you know, VCs most of VCS they are
like pattern matching.
00:53:31:08 - 00:53:35:13
Jens
They, they they are no magicians. They they just look at patterns.
00:53:35:13 - 00:53:38:26
Stefan
They're they're looking for the next Uber or Airbnb based on what they've seen.
00:53:38:26 - 00:54:23:24
Jens
Yeah. But here's, here's the problem. So they look at you, they look at the market you're in and
they do some extrapolation and they are like market is too small like we cannot invest. Market
is too small. Not gonna work. And I think that like the what's what's fundamentally and you know
that that's discussion like we like our, our our seat investor Steve he's such a, such a great
person to to, to have such deep discussions and, and we, we have this ongoing discussion
around is it the market or is it the founders, like if you want to have like $1 billion company.
00:54:23:26 - 00:54:25:09
Stefan
00:54:25:11 - 00:54:49:25
Jens
Is it about the founders who, who or is it about the company being at the right time, like, luck
and all these kind of things and, you know, like this, there's one, one train of thought that that's
like, if you build a startup and there comes a wave and the startup is in the right position, it can
just ride this wave and boom, billion dollar company.
00:54:49:27 - 00:55:14:09
Jens
And then there's this other train of thought where you can say, okay, there's this wave and
there's the there's a startup, it's in the wrong place. But the founders, they are smart and they
recognize this and they react and they bring the company into the into the right place. And they,
are responsible for that. I'm not sure.
00:55:14:09 - 00:55:46:14
Jens
Like what what is the right thing, but regarding VCs and pattern matching, I, I sometimes think
like, you know, don't get stuck on market size. Just one, one, one way of thinking differently is if
this team gets it right, it's possible that they create a completely new market because the way
people work changes. For example, AI everything changes.
00:55:46:19 - 00:56:15:05
Jens
Nobody is able or nobody was able to predict what's going to happen with AI so why some like I
just don't understand why sometimes it's so important for VCs to think about market size and
then just another way to think about it is, what kind of market could this founder create? And
yeah, that's just my my $0.02 here.
00:56:15:08 - 00:56:30:07
Stefan
It's spot on because like look at the market Airbnb created. Like it didn't exist before. It was like
you could sleep at your friend's house or like you had an extra room and you didn't do much
with it. And then now it's like this whole new market in an economy of like, Holy crap, I can lease
out my room.
00:56:30:07 - 00:56:53:16
Stefan
I can get people to stay in my apartment when I'm not there. Like, and then it created this billion
dollar company. Same thing with Uber is that this for me is the coolest thing ever. Like airports
don't change much and when they do, it's a giant reconstruction. Every airport in the world now
unless like they have like some boycott against Uber has a designated spot for Uber that
completely changed the transportation industry.
00:56:53:17 - 00:57:17:24
Stefan
And for me, it's like you can't see that when you meet Travis Kalanick, but you can see that
Travis Kalanick or Jens is like, damn this guy. He can do something. I don't know if he can do it
like I think he can, but he can create something. I'm going to bet on him. And I think for early
stage companies, you should always bet on the founder if you really see something in him,
because you kind of just gave me a good analogy.
00:57:17:24 - 00:57:35:20
Stefan
I feel like, I don't know, you're mostly into skiing, but like here in Florida, like I've gone surfing
before. Surfing is a lot of waiting. You're waiting on the board and it's kind of like a startup.
You're building, you're building, you're building. But then you see that wave, whether it's AI,
whether it's Federation, or whether it's whatever. And that's when you ride the wave.
00:57:35:20 - 00:57:54:28
Stefan
And I think good founders are the ones that are building and they're looking for silver, but they're
looking for that golden wave. And when that wave comes, they pivot right on to it. Because, for
example, how many companies do you remember during Covid that exploded, like all these like
voice chat companies or like cameo or whatever, they rode the wave of the pandemic.
00:57:55:03 - 00:58:10:16
Stefan
A lot of them crashed afterwards. You know, they had the crazy evaluations and everything. But
the founders did go. You can't argue the founders are pretty successful. Maybe the company
didn't do good, but as a founder, you need to be reactive. You need to be able to ride these
waves whether or not it aligns with the mission or not.
00:58:10:18 - 00:58:13:10
Stefan
What do you think?
00:58:13:13 - 00:58:57:28
Jens
It's it's difficult because, you know, you have companies, extremely good market, bad founders,
still successful. You have other companies, best founders in the world like market, horrible. Like,
it's it's it's tough and yeah, I don't know, it's it's it's like a mixed bag. I mean, we're, we're
founders. So we're obviously super biased on, on, on in terms of founders, but yeah, to be
honest, I think, you can be a good founder you should be a good founder, but ultimately you,
you need to be in the, in the, in the right market.
00:58:57:28 - 00:59:01:03
Stefan
You market always wins.
00:59:01:06 - 00:59:39:12
Jens
Yeah. And you know, this this other thing is if you talk about market size like, what I said earlier,
like market size, it's not everything. But still you want to be in a market that is decently sized at
least where you start, like you want to sell into, a warm market, into a market that's, that's
already it's it's extremely tough to warm up something from, from the get go and, yeah, this is
also something we, we learned in the, in the early days, when, when we were starting out, we,
you know, very technical driven.
00:59:39:12 - 01:00:13:07
Jens
I was like, we are better than Apollo. We do things differently, we do them better. We have a
better approach. And, it's yeah, it's it's not the right thing, but what we what we did then, you
know, in the, in the very beginning we were starting like, okay, we, we build an open source
alternative. So you can say like, okay, it's, it's the same thing, but open source similar to like
super base, open source alternative to, to what was it from from Google.
01:00:13:10 - 01:00:49:29
Jens
firebase. Yeah, exactly. But if you so initially just open source and look at what we're doing
today. Cache warmer, EDFs. We allow you to, to to to bring together federation with event
driven architecture. Then we, we have yeah. I don't know so many other things where we,
where we’re different now. I yeah, we're, we're different now and
01:00:50:02 - 01:01:14:19
Jens
Yeah, it's hard to say, but, ideally you can somehow start riding a wave. Someone else has
created. But to really be successful, eventually you also need to create your own wave, which
we're going to be doing, at some point.
01:01:14:19 - 01:01:40:18
Stefan
But yeah. Yeah, I would say that like there's two approaches you can enter into a market like,
Qualcomm, you can enter into like the CRM market and like that Salesforce created and you
can make great money there. Absolutely. You can be a very successful company. But eventually,
if you want to be the best, you either have to own the entire market or you have to create your
own market.
01:01:40:18 - 01:02:02:14
Stefan
And the only way you can do that is through innovation. So every company, if they want to
become that billion dollar company, they do have to innovate. You can't get there without, you
know, by riding just a wave up there. And like for example, you brought it up today. Cursor.
Cursor is the fastest company in history to go from 0 to 100 million ARR.
01:02:02:16 - 01:02:24:26
Stefan
They didn't innovate anything, which is crazy to me. All they did was forked VSCode, added API
AI capabilities to it, and now they're the fastest company to 0 to 100 million ARR. But doesn't
that kind of break the point of like, innovation though? Like, am I contradicting myself? Like, did
they innovate by adding AI to it, or did they just see something that the market wanted them?
01:02:24:26 - 01:02:31:02
Stefan
Or like, hey, we can we can do this. They are such an interesting example.
01:02:31:05 - 01:03:24:21
Jens
I think from an investor perspective, cursor is super dangerous. It's like, what's the moat?
Because I also have like GitHub, I have GitHub Copilot and and we can now talk about the
nuances of what, what can Curser do and what can copilot do and what can other solutions do
and that I don't know, for, for me, when I see crazy fast growth, there's always also some sort of
danger involved in the sense that, you know, if you look at the startup and they go from, from 0
to 100 million ARR, in one year, you can only innovate so much in one year.
01:03:24:23 - 01:03:56:27
Jens
Right? So how much moat was created? Because look at for example, like the long term view of
slack because like one, one like for me one fundamental thing is like, I believe the big winners in
AI will be people will be companies who built platforms that are not AI. So for me, one of the
biggest winners in the AI game is, for example, GitHub.
01:03:57:01 - 01:04:27:20
Jens
Because GitHub has something you can't use AI to bring, I don't know, 100 million developers
onto a platform. You can't cheat this. And but if you have a distribution, if you have network, if
you have all these companies have like GitHub organizations like that is like, like like a real
moat. And now imagine, there's like a new startup and they do something like cursor or whatnot.
01:04:27:22 - 01:04:56:25
Jens
And then you take GitHub and they, they copy that. Who will win the long term and look at Slack
and Slack versus teams and yeah, just just Google slack versus teams. Click on on the like.
Click on one of the graphs and you will realize that, the ARR of slack, it's a rounding error for, for
teams because long term like slack is great.
01:04:56:25 - 01:05:27:26
Jens
Like we use slack. We like it. We we hate teams. But distribution is what what what matters.
Long term. And so I don't know in terms of. Yeah. Cursor I'm, I'm not sure I, if I was the VC, I
wouldn't bet on these short term trends. I would bet on like who's who's building the platforms.
Because if you have the platform, you can sell cursors any day.
01:05:27:26 - 01:05:55:04
Jens
And so yeah, but but maybe I'm just super stupid and I, I, I don't know much about, AI but, I'm,
I'm thinking a lot in terms of platforms and collaboration and to be honest, well, for me, the most
exciting thing is to to bring people together. I think if you can build a workflow that enables
people to work together, this is it's something sticky.
01:05:55:04 - 01:06:02:23
Jens
It's something valuable, and we can add AI to that or we we don't do it, but yeah.
01:06:02:25 - 01:06:21:10
Stefan
That's fair. So I don't know. We're almost out of time. I want to end with one final question. So if
you were a VC, though, where would you put your bets on? It could be a company. It can be an
industry. But you're a VC. You have a new fund. What three companies would you invest in or
what?
01:06:21:10 - 01:06:22:19
Jens
Three companies.
01:06:22:21 - 01:06:42:00
Stefan
It could be three companies. Three ideas like where would you put your money. So for me, I
would put mine. Number one is that I believe that in the future that all of us will have access to
nuclear power, like just the same way that we have like, power at our house. Imagine that.
There's a little thing that attaches to your house, and your house is powered by nuclear power.
01:06:42:02 - 01:07:10:07
Stefan
I don't know why, but I think that would be an amazing place. It would be cheap, be fantastic,
and it powers the entire house. This is actually funny from David. I'm not biased, but
underground. Very true to collaboration. Monday.com I mean, you'll probably put this one as is
your example too. Monday.com is a full collaboration company and they do 3 billion in ARR 3
billion in IRR, and all they do is help teams just collaborate a little bit.
01:07:10:14 - 01:07:29:23
Stefan
And I don't mean they just help teams like it's pretty useful what they do. And then the second
one is. I don't know what it is, but it's what you said. It's not the people building AI companies,
it's the people building the shovels for the AI company. So for me, Nvidia obviously is going to
be a long term winner.
01:07:29:23 - 01:07:44:27
Stefan
So if I could I put more into Nvidia people building graphics cards, people building chips, people
building to power these AI companies. Those would be my three bets or industries that I would
place my money into. What about you?
01:07:45:00 - 01:08:14:12
Jens
Wow. It's it's a tough question because, I'm not an investor. I'm not thinking day to day about
this, but, I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I would say what bothers me personally, like, I think
my my number one thing that I think it's just, it's just impossible. The biggest thing that that
bothers me is I think we should have more peace in the world.
01:08:14:14 - 01:08:40:17
Jens
Like, throughout, like, I'm now 37 and I don't know why. Maybe it's a media thing, but I get the
feeling that I don't know that that people are are becoming more and more aggressive towards
each other. I don't like it. You if you know me personally, I'm a person that needs harmony. Like
the best way I can like it, really.
01:08:40:17 - 01:08:45:02
Jens
I really struggle when when we have, like, like,
01:08:45:04 - 01:08:46:25
Stefan
Tension between each other or something.
01:08:46:26 - 01:09:13:24
Jens
Yeah. When, when there's tension in the team or something. I it it keeps me awake at night.
This is, this is the, this bothers me. And, I don't know, as a European, this whole situation in, in
the USA, it, it bothers me because for one, I, I want everybody to have, like, free trade and to
cooperate and to work together.
01:09:13:26 - 01:09:21:07
Jens
But I don't know, it's, it seems to me to be very hard for the next couple, couple of years.
01:09:21:09 - 01:09:31:06
Stefan
So a start up that would solve peace. Okay. So that's one. And then what would be the second
or third one, like if you were a VC.
01:09:31:08 - 01:09:36:26
Jens
Startup that solves peace I don't know. Like I'm not sure if anybody wants to invest into this. It's.
01:09:37:02 - 01:09:41:07
Stefan
It's still a good idea. Who knows?
01:09:41:09 - 01:10:05:01
Jens
I think that the next big topic, like, you know, it's not about, like, this doesn't need to make
sense. But I think the next big topic is, we need, we need, clean energy, and we really need to
take care of the planet. I think we're we're we're fucking it up. Unfortunately, and we need to do
something about it.
01:10:05:04 - 01:10:32:18
Jens
Unfortunately, I'm not smart enough. I can I can contribute some API gateways and maybe a
little bit of federation if if that helps. But, yeah, somebody has to figure out, affordable green
energy so that we can we can live a little bit longer here. Third thing, I don't know. I feel.
01:10:32:18 - 01:10:33:19
Stefan
Like I'm.
01:10:33:21 - 01:10:41:21
Jens
Super biased. Obviously, that's. But if we talk about.
01:10:41:23 - 01:11:19:28
Jens
Yes, if we talk about, if we talk about the, the, the future of mankind, I think the the biggest thing
is, you know, this, like, from Andreessen Horowitz, like, our software is eating the world. I
wouldn't say that negatively. I would say the the future of mankind is driven by software, and we
need, I think we the only way we we can build more and better software and solve like, energy
and whatnot.
01:11:20:00 - 01:11:51:22
Jens
I think the foundation for that is we need more software, we need better software, and we need
more people to work in software. I don't believe that magically, boom, AI will write all the
software. You know, you can generate websites with AI, but the moment it gets like super
complex, and the moment you need like 100 people each on each of the 100 people has like
some context window of billions of tokens in their head, and they have some understanding of
the domain.
01:11:51:24 - 01:12:26:23
Jens
I think it just gets like so complex. You need humans. And so for me, it's we need better ways to
build better software. We need better ways to to collaborate on building software. The
foundation for sharing business logic is APIs. And as such, we need better platforms, better
collaborative workflows so that more people can build. Yeah, better things, share them with APIs
and all this kind of thing.
01:12:27:00 - 01:12:52:14
Jens
This is, you know, the like the the foundation of WunderGraph is like our, our north star. It's it's
always like building the GitHub for APIs. And this is really. Yeah helping helping teams, helping
companies to work together to to collaborate. And it's it's what drives us of the three things. Two
I cannot really do anything about it, about it because I'm, I'm not qualified.
01:12:52:15 - 01:12:59:26
Jens
But yeah, maybe we can we can contribute, a layer of API collaboration.
01:12:59:29 - 01:13:20:26
Stefan
Now, what a way to end. I mean, your typical CEO. Avoid the question. Pitch the startup, which
is fair. And then also about the non-qualified. If you guys remember a couple episodes back
Jens was completely unqualified to be an architect, but he did it anyways. So if you have a big
idea, go chase it. If it's something you're passionate about and you really care about it, as we
talked about in this episode, just do it.
01:13:21:00 - 01:13:34:23
Stefan
Because the people that care are the ones that change the world, and the people that can just
go through all the nos. They're the ones that change the world. And the last one I want to add to
that is, is, actually I just blanked. So we'll just end the episode there. But guys.
01:13:34:25 - 01:13:40:12
Jens
I'll go ahead. I have something perfect, you know? You know what the good thing is?
01:13:40:15 - 01:13:40:29
Stefan
What's the good.
01:13:40:29 - 01:13:45:04
Jens
Thing? We're back next week.
01:13:45:07 - 01:13:55:14
Stefan
He's right. So, guys, thanks so much for joining us. We'll be back next week. Same time as
always, 9 a.m.. And let's see what we talk about next week. Thanks Jens.
01:13:55:16 - 01:13:55:27
Stefan
Bye, guys.
