00:32:47:22 - 00:32:50:17

Stefan
I don't know anything. You're the problem. So I don't know if you can marry yourself.
00:32:50:17 - 00:33:06:05
Jens
So. But you know, like like from a from a technical point of view, from a mathematical point of
view, if you're married, you definitely have at least one problem in your life. Absolutely.
00:33:06:08 - 00:33:26:08
Stefan
Oh, what's the saying? No, I'm not going to say it out loud. Bop bop bop bop. I just like, said it
out loud in my head. All right, onto the next topic. This one's interesting. AI might be slowing
down our workflows. Personally, for me, it's speeding me up. So I don't know what this article is
about.
00:33:26:11 - 00:33:48:22
Stefan
I'm able to build things I wasn't able to build before, but, this is one of the articles that we've
already seen. It's measuring the impact of early 2025 AI and the experienced open source
developer productivity. And so it's a great study. I highly recommend that you take a look at it,
because it's really goes into deep of how it's affecting.
00:33:48:22 - 00:34:15:04
Stefan
But long story short, if you were to just kind of look at the time article, it'll show you exactly what
you kind of need to know, which is the tldr. But basically, developers are being slowed down by
19% by using tools like cursor. And the thing is, cursor and other tools are advertising that you
are 20% productive or more productive by using it.
00:34:15:07 - 00:34:23:00
Stefan
Yeah. And I know you have some experience with this. What is your take on this? That AI is
actually slowing developers down.
00:34:23:03 - 00:34:26:08
Jens
Can can you open this article again?
00:34:26:11 - 00:34:29:05
Stefan
Do you want the sciencey you want or do you want the time. So on.
00:34:29:07 - 00:34:30:16
Jens
No science.
00:34:30:18 - 00:34:31:11
(Mix)
Okay.
00:34:31:14 - 00:34:34:15
Stefan
We go for the real stuff.
00:34:34:17 - 00:34:45:18
Jens
Okay. Can you search for the number 16. 16? Okay. Read this sentence.
00:34:45:20 - 00:34:49:18
Stefan
Oh, yikes. That's their sample size.
00:34:49:20 - 00:34:51:08
Jens
Read the sentence.
00:34:51:10 - 00:35:11:19
Stefan
To directly measure the real world impact of AI tools or software development, we recruited 16
experienced developers from large open source repositories leveraging 22 K stars 1 million
lines of code that they've contributed for multiple years. Developers provide a list of real issues
246 that would be valuable to the repository. Bug fixes, features, refactors that would normally
be part of their regular work.
00:35:11:21 - 00:35:20:12
Stefan
Then we randomly assign each issue to either allow or disallow. Use of AI will work on an issue
when AI is allowed. Developers can use any tool. Do I keep reading? Okay.
00:35:20:14 - 00:35:42:21
Jens
It's good. So I know you keep making jokes that ha ha ha. Jens. Studied psychology. It's boring.
Ha ha ha. I know you keep making this kind of jokes, but if you studied psychology, you would
immediately see that and you would be immediately like, okay, this is nonsense.
00:35:42:24 - 00:35:47:12
Stefan
Yeah, it's kind of crazy that they actually publish this. 16 people.
00:35:47:14 - 00:35:58:08
Jens
Like who, who published this, like TechCrunch or somebody like who, who spreads this word
like, I don't know who metr is, but like, who.
00:35:58:10 - 00:35:58:22
(Mix)
Who.
00:35:58:24 - 00:36:00:25
Jens
Who reshared it.
00:36:00:27 - 00:36:05:04
Stefan
It's an organization about like, okay.
00:36:05:06 - 00:36:13:08
Jens
But who knows? I mean, these guys, I don't know who they are. Like, this is just somebody. But
this was in the news, right?
00:36:13:10 - 00:36:28:24
Stefan
Yes. So this is the founder and CEO. She's all about AI. But let me go to the times article
because, this study got published into the times article, which crazy. I didn't actually see that. So
that her sample size was 16 people.
00:36:28:26 - 00:36:53:22
Jens
And I'm really honest. Like this is it's so important if you look at research like this, it is super
important that you that you look at the numbers. And if we're if we're investigating a data set of
16 developers, like we can still look at it and there can be that there can be something in it. It
can be true.
00:36:53:23 - 00:37:27:22
Jens
Like, I'm not saying this is garbage. I'm saying the data set is extremely small. It would have
been so much better if they did this with like a hundred devs over six months or something. 16
devs. It's possible that, for example, there's something in science. We call it selection bias. Just
by picking the one, the wrong group of developers, it can mean that the data set skews in one
direction.
00:37:27:25 - 00:37:56:09
Jens
And, the way you would actually combat against this is, we're now learning something about,
what psychologists actually do. The way you combat is, let's say you have a full data set of 200
developers. You would then pick random sets of 50 and you compare, you compare them
against each other to each other. You have like, there's, like statistics tools for that.
00:37:56:12 - 00:38:24:12
Jens
And this way you can actually see how, how, how uniform is your data set and are there
problems in your data set. Because ideally, if you have 200 devs and you pick randomly 50,
they should always come out at the at the same like they should always tell you like the same
indications like, for example, the main, the main case here, the main message is devs are slow
down 20%.
00:38:24:14 - 00:38:54:21
Jens
So if you randomly pick 50 devs you should always come out at 50. At 20% slower. If this varies
a lot, then it's much worse. Now the problem is, if you just have 16 devvs, you cannot really pick
a slice of that because it's so it's such, such a small amount of developers and, so, yeah, I don't
know how much we should read into that, into that, report.
00:38:54:24 - 00:39:09:08
Stefan
Why don't they have comments like, why aren't people roasting this like, you can't publish
something at the time? They're saying they measure the speed of 16. Developers like that is so
tiny that doesn't tell you anything.
00:39:09:10 - 00:39:13:17
Jens
Yeah. I don't know.
00:39:13:19 - 00:39:37:14
Stefan
And it really comes and draws a conclusion. But I think it's what Jacob said. So if you
remember, every time on Twitter when something like funny happens, like, for example, like, do
you remember when GCP went down and, everybody likes, just got laid off from Google today?
I was in charge of running infrastructure like they always do, like that type of take.
00:39:37:16 - 00:39:58:16
Stefan
And something happened like that with Google and this guy was trolling and all these like pretty
big publications posted it like his thing. He was like young developer fired for accidentally
causing outage at Google, but he was completely trolling. And I think the whole thing right now
with the media is it's what Jacob said, I'm going to bring it back up, which is, oh, on one.
00:39:58:18 - 00:40:14:14
Stefan
But people actually don't care about the results. All they care about is the headline that drives
their narrative. So a lot of people are saying, yeah, AI is good or AI is bad. This one's for the AI
is bad. It's slowing people down. And it's just saying, yep, I care more about the headline then
the actual science, but I actually didn't even read the article.
00:40:14:14 - 00:40:18:24
Stefan
I don't want to read the article now. I just saw the headline. So I'm actually at fault for that.
00:40:18:27 - 00:40:46:02
Jens
But I can I can give you some some tips from what we have learned in, in, in, that when, when
we studied this, this field, so there's scientific journals and these journals, there are like big
publications in psychology and other fields. And these journals, they review something and they
would never post a study like this with 16 engineers.
00:40:46:02 - 00:41:17:08
Jens
They would they would say, hey, guys, you're the you're not following our guidelines. The the
sample size is way too small. Please. Another approach and, so what you can look for is if you if
you are interested in such research papers, you always want to find them in the big journals
who have, who have reviewed this and posted it themselves, because that gives the, the, the
paper a lot more credibility.
00:41:17:11 - 00:41:18:03
Jens
Yeah.
00:41:18:05 - 00:41:29:08
Stefan
And Nithin actually posted a good question here. So how do you make such studies when some
are better than others are using AI? Nithan, why don't you use AI to write the sentence? It's from
capitalization or nothing.
00:41:29:08 - 00:41:57:07
Jens
But beside my point Nithin, this is the whole point. This is why. Why you want to do such a study
with the thousand developers or like much, much bigger. And then there's also the question like
if you have 16 dev, maybe this study is true for rust backend development or C++, but maybe in
in JavaScript frontend development it would speed you up.
00:41:57:07 - 00:42:19:01
Jens
But we don't know because it's just 16 people. And how much do we know about the people
which like are they working on front and back. And in this case it said they are working on open
source projects, which by the way this this is already selection bias because most developers
do not work on big open source projects.
00:42:19:08 - 00:42:30:26
Jens
Most developers work on super boring enterprise proprietary code bases, with Java or
something or PHP or whatever.
00:42:31:01 - 00:42:33:14
(Mix)
And yeah.
00:42:33:17 - 00:42:38:06
Jens
I don't know. Like, yeah.
00:42:38:08 - 00:42:50:00
Stefan
Well said next topic? Lovable? Or do you have anything else to add to this? Maybe tell the
people one more time that you studied psychology or business psychology? I.
00:42:50:02 - 00:43:19:23
Jens
I, I like this is live so I cannot show certain things with my hands, but, I can just speak from
personal experience. So, I, I tried using cursor for quite a time, so I'm. Or I'm using cursor for
quite a time, and when you do like react front end, it's okay. When you do full stack TypeScript
it's okay.
00:43:19:25 - 00:43:52:25
Jens
I tried using cursor for go. It wasn't very productive. And then I also tried claude code. Pretty
cool tool. I really like it. I think it's it's very smart. And the the way the workflow is, is amazing. I
absolutely love it. The problem I tried claude for building an AI agent with the master framework.
It completely code looked nice, didn't work at all.
00:43:52:27 - 00:43:57:01
(Mix)
Like it? It couldn't. They look for all it.
00:43:57:02 - 00:44:21:08
Jens
It couldn't even figure out imports, like, I don't know. So the, the I was using opus four and then
sonnet four as the model, the code quality, it was just garbage like unusable. So I threw that
away. And I also tried using claude for writing some go code for our GraphQL go tools thats
cosmo router. It also completely failed.
00:44:21:08 - 00:44:52:24
Jens
I didn't really understand the problem or didn't have a good idea of creating the solution, so I
ended up just writing the code by hand. So. But this is n equals one like this is not the case
study or something. It's just my. So so far my personal experience AI is yeah it's okay.
Sometimes it's cool. It can write tests or you can, you can, quickly get something together,
create like an example or something.
00:44:52:24 - 00:45:07:27
Jens
But I don't know, I always get the impression that if you have an existing code base that is
somewhat large, then AI completely fails. But yeah, I don't know.
00:45:08:00 - 00:45:15:16
Stefan
We should write a case study on this, a whole, peer reviewed by me, and it's just based on your
experience.
00:45:15:18 - 00:45:18:29
(Mix)
We should we should do, we should.
00:45:18:29 - 00:45:56:02
Jens
Do a neutral study, and we we will interview all WunderGraph employees what they think about
WunderGraph. And by the way, this there's, this is also you learn it in psychology. For example,
one way to get absolute great results is we we do a group interview. So you should always
interview everybody together should always be public and for example, if you interview people
how they like the CEO of WunderGraph Me, then it's it's best if the CEO is also in the room,
because that will absolutely not bias anybody.
00:45:56:02 - 00:46:14:03
Jens
Nobody will be afraid of of saying their opinion. But honestly, I don't think you have to do it
because everybody loves me. And, I'm, I'm super smart and, every, every evening we, we
dance in a circle and we say, Jens Jens Jens, and,
00:46:14:05 - 00:46:19:08
(Mix)
What is this a cult? .. WunderGraph!
00:46:19:14 - 00:46:21:13
Jens
WunderGraph!
00:46:21:16 - 00:46:45:27
Stefan
All right, all right, you're done. You're done. Next topic. Help me understand this, is are we in a
bubble? What is going on? How is vibe coding growing? So, fast. So, me, Jens and Bjorn were
actually talking about this today. So. Okay, let me share my screen. But basically Tldr is lovable
has about 80 million in revenue.
00:46:45:29 - 00:46:58:12
Stefan
They've just gotten unicorn status after eight months after launch, which by the way, I don't think
it's true. It's not eight months like they've been building the product for like a year before that.
And then they launched it.
00:46:58:15 - 00:47:00:17
(Mix)
But they.
00:47:00:19 - 00:47:25:16
Stefan
Just raised a 200 million. I think it's the largest series A in European history, which is pretty
crazy. This is crazy, by the way. So they have 180 paying customers, and they have revenues of
75,000,000 in 7 months, but they have about 2.3 million users. And they also have 45 full time
employees, which I thought was interesting.
00:47:25:18 - 00:47:30:18
Jens
Oh, I would love to know their churn rate.
00:47:30:20 - 00:47:36:07
(Mix)
Yeah. I don't know.
00:47:36:09 - 00:47:55:25
Stefan
10 million projects that have been created on the platform to date. I mean it's impressive
though, you got to be honest. Like okay, so they've given the ability to code to anybody. You just
prompt, which is great. Every day, brilliant founders and operators with game changer at the
same. Oh they don't have a developer. It's really quickly like yeah it's fair.
00:47:55:27 - 00:48:18:00
Stefan
For example, this company was made by a large Brazilian and they Brazilian edtech and they
grossed 3,000,000 in 40 eight hours. But what do you think? Like we were talking about this, is
this defensible? Is this something that can actually grow and like become a legitimate company?
I think it can also Replit just hit 100 million in ARR, so I don't know.
00:48:18:00 - 00:48:23:29
Stefan
I think we're in an interesting time.
00:48:24:01 - 00:48:55:01
Jens
I, I yeah, I don't know, like, well, what I saw is so they raised 200 million I mean first of all, don't
don't get me wrong because you, you you might be like, oh, they are doing so much better than
then WunderGraph. And I'm grumpy and blah blah blah. I'm, I'm absolutely not like it's it's
phenomenal what they have built and we're, we're not comparing ourselves to to what they are
doing.
00:48:55:04 - 00:49:17:20
Jens
And it's great work. What I'm thinking about is okay, so now they have 200 million. I did a little
bit of research and what they have or what it seems they have figured out is that, a lot of
companies, they, they, they, don't use lovable. And when companies use lovable, someone
creates like an example or like a draft.
00:49:17:22 - 00:49:51:08
Jens
And then at some point they hand this over to developers and, then developers turn it into like a
real project or scale it. I think we also haven't seen, like, how will something like lovable work
like over multiple years, like a lovable app and for me, the reality is I already know what
happens when a lovable app scales because, if you hand it over to developers and they
continue using AI, that means we're back to claude, we're back to cursor, and there already is
cursor.
00:49:51:08 - 00:50:35:04
Jens
There already is claude. And like there's another thing like, from open API. No, OpenAI has a
tool. Gemini has a tool like there's so much competition in the market of, helping developers to
code. And this right here is allowing anybody to start creating a project. And I'm Wondering, in
the long term, if they're if if they hit hard limits, is it possible that lovable will forever be the
scaffolding tool where I build a tiny project, but it will never scale to be like a big project?
00:50:35:06 - 00:51:18:17
Jens
And I'm. Yeah, I'm just wondering like, what's the what's the long term trajectory? Obviously it's
it's phenomenal. Like in eight months to 75 million ARR. That's absolutely crazy. And it seems
they can continue with, with that growth. It's just a question of if other if other companies will,
will, will start competing more and more like I think Google has an app builder and there's others
and if there will be like a hard physical wall where you just can't scale lovable to like big multi-
team approaches, whatever, then the the question is like, what?
00:51:18:17 - 00:51:34:15
Jens
What will happen to this company in, in the long run, if you get 200 million series A, you need to
to somehow bring back this money in terms of revenue and, yeah, that's, that's a massive
challenge.
00:51:34:17 - 00:51:54:18
Stefan
I would say. Also, I also think it's phenomenal to like, first of all, it's one of Europe's fastest
growing and latest unicorns. So also it's great for the European tech ecosystem. I don't know I
don't know what's going to happen. I think who knows because it feels like we're in the.com
boom. Like you remember everybody was like, remember Pets.com.
00:51:54:18 - 00:52:13:16
Stefan
All these companies making money, raising money like, what was the company? Something
Cloud from Andreessen Horowitz before I got acquired. Like it wasn't even amazing business. It
just got acquired by HP and a great outcome. But like, he was able to grow it really fast with a
lot of venture capital funding. I think we might be in a bubble.
00:52:13:18 - 00:52:32:29
Stefan
I don't think that's a bad thing. People that survived the bubble, those companies stay for life. So
that's fantastic. But I don't know. I still think it's an insanely impressive. Also, I wonder what it
feels like. Imagine being at something that's just from 0 to 8 months, 80 million in revenue.
That's crazy. So it's definitely a rocketship.
00:52:33:01 - 00:52:38:28
Jens
Yeah. Like.
00:52:39:00 - 00:53:14:14
Stefan
It it is what it is. Okay. And now the last one. All right. This one's interesting. Why is this guy in
the video? This guy's so annoying. You've probably seen this guy, but next topic, unless you
have anything else to say for the last one, I going to wrap on this topic. Okay, so this is a New
York Times article by matter's new superintelligence lab is discussing a major strategy change
their new chief AI officer, Alexander Wang.
00:53:14:14 - 00:53:39:20
Stefan
So this is the founder of scale AI that Facebook or Meta bot. He's thinking of developing a
closed source one versus an open source one. That's him right there. This is also, what's his
name? That really annoying guy on Twitter drives me crazy. But basically they've been open
sourcing all their models. They're thinking now to keep it closed sourced.
00:53:39:22 - 00:53:51:29
Stefan
What are your thoughts on that? Especially us being an open source company. It's kind of
interesting to see. I'm wondering why they're thinking this, whether it's something with China's
deep seek or it's just something in general.
00:53:52:01 - 00:54:25:06
Jens
So if I did a little bit of research and if you think about it, the the models they are building, like if
I, if I got it right, one sec, where's my where's my summary? I think the model will have like 2
trillion parameters. Yeah 2 trillion parameters. And the question here is if you have such a
model, the the hardware, it would take you to actually run it.
00:54:25:08 - 00:54:57:26
Jens
There's just a bunch of companies on the planet who could run this model. And then there's the
question like if you if you open source, it, open sourcing needs to have some benefits. Like if we
open source cosmo router, then a lot of people can can run it. It can run on commodity
hardware. If you model if you open source a model that requires, I don't know, a whole data
center of GPUs, like, are you donating this to Jeff Bezos or what's going on?
00:54:57:26 - 00:55:24:18
Jens
So I don't know. I, I'm not sure if that's such a such a big topic, to be honest. It's a big switch for,
for meta to go away from from open source. Yeah. But I don't know what you, what you see is
like meta is, is an ads company and as someone selling ads with the changes we currently see,
you know, the behavior of users, it changes.
00:55:24:20 - 00:55:52:07
Jens
Instead of surfing the web or going to Facebook and, and, like interacting with the website. Now
you have people they open like chatGPT. They ask whatever. It gives you the answer back.
People don't surf on websites anymore. Or, another thing that, I know, I don't know if you also
have this in the, in the US, but in, WhatsApp you can now also chat with an AI.
00:55:52:09 - 00:56:19:03
Jens
So not not necessarily. You have to interact with these websites and, yeah, this can also affect
the business model of, of, ads. So I don't know, maybe maybe that change is going to happen
to, to metas business model. So I don't know how how Facebook will continue in the, in the
future. Like, I'm not using it for many years now.
00:56:19:03 - 00:56:25:04
Jens
I don't know, never, never use it that much. But yeah. What are your thoughts?
00:56:25:07 - 00:56:55:04
Stefan
I think it's interesting. I think Zuck or Mark Zuckerberg, he's probably one of the best CEOs
probably over the last 20 years, especially from a founders point of view. Oh, put up the in the
top categories between like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos. Because every time you think he's out, he
somehow gets back into it. So if you saw he bought a minority stake for 3 billion into Ray-Ban or
to Sunglass Hut, the company that owns Ray-Ban, because he's really pushing for these metal
glasses.
00:56:55:07 - 00:57:17:04
Stefan
Second, he's poaching all these people from OpenAI and he's poaching people from, scale AI.
And to him, this is just pennies. You know, it might be 16 billion, but for meta, it's just pennies on
the dollar. For them, the outcome is is massive. And so if you see right here, though oh switched
up the view. There we go.
00:57:17:08 - 00:57:42:10
Stefan
If you see right here though right under where I highlighted the superintelligence lab discussions
are preliminary and no decisions have been made on potential changes. I think that they wrote a
news article to get views, but this is still no decision has been made. And then the last one that I
think is important here is that this year, the Chinese AI company Deepseek released an
advanced AI chat bot, thanks in part to the US open source code.
00:57:42:12 - 00:58:04:24

I don't know, they might also be getting government pressure. So if you've seen anthropic won a
military deal of 200 million with the government, ChatGPT has a deal with the government. Is it
the US government possibly could be facing, government pressure to make it closed source?
Because if you think about it, we're in kind of like not a nuclear arms race, but an AI arms race
with other countries as well.
00:58:04:26 - 00:58:11:23
Stefan
And so there's AI, there's Russia in play, and then there's the US. So this possibly could even be
a political reason of why they're getting pushed to it.
00:58:11:26 - 00:58:21:17
Jens
But those what what you're saying is if they built such a powerful model, they shouldn't give it
away for free to everybody else.
00:58:21:19 - 00:58:42:24
Stefan
I'm not saying that, I think the government might be saying that it's definitely a race right now,
and the government might want us to keep it proprietary with the US, especially if this has the
capabilities. I think David, he, he linked it was like AI 2075 or whatever. And it talks about how
governments use AI to overthrow other governments.
00:58:42:27 - 00:59:05:25
Stefan
Just releasing it across the mainframe, turning off technologies, pretending to be employees,
things like that. Obviously, it's a little bit of science fiction, but you never know. Maybe the
government's pressuring meta. And one super interesting thing that you said. So you say
government, meta is an advertising company. Do you know why they pitched themselves as an
advertising company?
00:59:05:27 - 00:59:07:09
Jens
Repeat.
00:59:07:11 - 00:59:28:09
Stefan
You said meta is an advertising company, right? It's an ads company. Yep. Okay, so I was
reading this cool thing, this article basically about how, startups and monopolies, they will hide
themselves. A startup will be like, look at me, look at my logo wall. I'm a big company. I'm a big
company. And when I'm up and a monopoly will be like, I'm actually not that big.
00:59:28:09 - 00:59:46:07
Stefan
This is the video that you sent me. Do you remember from, from Peter Thiel? Yeah, yeah. And,
so Facebook or we'll use Google. In this sense, Google is not a search company because if it
was, it would be a complete monopoly. Google is in the advertising space. Advertising is $1
trillion industry, and Google is a very small player into it.
00:59:46:15 - 00:59:55:28
Stefan
It's the same thing with Facebook. They're a very small player in the global advertising thing, but
if they were in the social network space, they would be a monopoly.
00:59:56:00 - 01:00:04:27
Jens
Yeah. Interesting. So what what what are we? We are we're in the computer market, right?
01:00:04:29 - 01:00:14:13
Stefan
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Technically, I mean, if we were in the Federation one. Yeah, we'll be
a monopoly there soon.
01:00:14:16 - 01:00:16:01
(Mix)
But okay.
01:00:16:03 - 01:00:21:07
Stefan
Any last minute topics? Anything you want to add before we sign off for the day?
01:00:21:10 - 01:00:27:00
Jens
And any last insults from the chat?
01:00:27:02 - 01:00:31:01
Stefan
Jen's messaging me on slack. Unshare. Maybe I like to. Yeah.
01:00:31:03 - 01:00:38:10
Jens
No, I, I switched the view. Because if you go, like, on the monologue, then I think it's, it's better if
you have the full view.
01:00:38:13 - 01:00:41:05
Stefan
If I go on the monologue or if you go on the monologue.
01:00:41:07 - 01:00:43:10
(Mix)
Yeah.
01:00:43:13 - 01:00:44:12
(Mix)
That, that that's.
01:00:44:12 - 01:00:48:18
Jens
A funny one. Should we even talk about this or.
01:00:48:20 - 01:00:48:24
(Mix)
We.
01:00:48:24 - 01:01:06:13
Stefan
Can save it for next week, but yeah, basically, don't go to a, don't go to Coldplay concerts with,
your, your people person, your chief. That is crazy, by the way. Like, I look them up on LinkedIn
like he's CEO and she's chief people officer. They're both married.
01:01:06:15 - 01:01:13:23
Jens
Yeah. I don't know why Coldplay. Like, if it was any other concert, it would have worked.
01:01:13:25 - 01:01:31:28
Stefan
Well, you know what I was saying? I was talking to Sofia about this. Like what? The Coldplay
concert. Like one. They were probably, like, holding each other and singing this song and being
like, wow, like, this is so beautiful. We're so alive. Like, I love Coldplay now. They probably
absolutely hate Coldplay. And second, if they would have just reacted normal, just like, hey, like,
how are you?
01:01:31:29 - 01:01:43:11
Stefan
Like whatever. Nobody would have cared and they wouldn't have blown up on social media. It's
because of the way they reacted that it got blown up. And then I got exposed.
01:01:43:14 - 01:02:08:27
Jens
I don't know, I, I really struggle with this, with this whole scene because it, it, it is incompatible
with, with my view of a relationship, you know, like, hey, how how can you be happy going to a
concert with the person that's not your wife? And obviously you're in the setup that.
01:02:09:00 - 01:02:10:28
(Mix)
I don't know. I have world.
01:02:10:28 - 01:02:23:20
Jens
Views, you know, like when like I work for wundergraph and then on the weekend I do
something with my family, with my kids, with my like, these are my loved ones.
01:02:23:23 - 01:02:25:06
(Mix)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:02:25:08 - 01:02:28:20
Jens
I don't know. I have really no comment about this whole thing.
01:02:28:23 - 01:02:31:17
Stefan
You should watch the Tiger Woods documentary then.
01:02:31:19 - 01:02:32:24
Jens
The what?
01:02:32:26 - 01:02:35:20
Stefan
The Tiger Woods documentary.
01:02:35:22 - 01:02:38:25
Jens
Tiger woods. Okay. Yeah.
01:02:38:27 - 01:02:46:23
Stefan
the good thing?
Some view of pleasure. Well, guys, thank you so much for a great episode. And, Yeah. What's
01:02:46:25 - 01:02:53:29
Stefan
We're back next week. Sometimes I feel like you forget it, but you're like, wait, that's a good
thing. Thanks, guys.
