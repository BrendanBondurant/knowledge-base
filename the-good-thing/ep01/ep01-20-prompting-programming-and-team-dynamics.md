summary: Jens argues that prompting an AI and writing code are both about translating business requirements into precise instructions, reinforcing that problem-solving matters more than syntax. He shares how building his own parsers and compilers for GraphQL deepened his understanding of programming, encouraging others to do the same. He stresses the value of teamwork, noting WunderGraph’s success came from diverse skills and strong collaboration, not just technical expertise

Jens

And it doesn't really matter if I write prompts and telling an lllm to do that, or if I write code,

because if you think about like prompting or prompt engineering or whatever, if you want to have

a working product that works reliable reliably for a customer, even if you do that with llms and AI

or whatever use, you somehow really have to narrow down what this thing does.

01:03:58:03 - 01:04:24:18Jens

So in a sense, even if you just use AI and prompts, you have to be very explicit about the

description of what the thing should do. So in the end, what's an LLM really is, well, what's an

LLM? What in a, what programing really is, is you figure out business requirements and you turn

that into a product.

01:04:24:21 - 01:05:11:12

Jens

And for me, and I think this is something that the young programmers should look at, for me, it's

not so important to actually write the code. Like the older I'm getting, the the less I'm actually

interested in writing code, because it's it's a lot of work and I'm lazy. But, at the end of the day, I

think what programmers really are, are and then a lot of, like, project managers and other

people, I think they will actually go away because what you really need to be able to do is take

customer requirements, turn them into business, and you can build such a such a strong career

in understanding business requirements

01:05:11:12 - 01:05:38:10

Jens

and turning them into products. And, I think that's that's what I would focus on. I would always

try to be very close to to the product, very close to the customers. Yeah. What what what other

advice? Understand programing languages. Well, one thing that really helped me is built my

own parsers and lexors and AST and other things.

01:05:38:12 - 01:05:46:14

Jens

I did this for GraphQL because there wasn't like the tooling. But the the good thing is.

01:05:46:17 - 01:05:48:26

Stefan

There it is. I was wondering when I was going to come.

01:05:48:29 - 01:06:11:18

Jens

The the good thing is, if you learn how to write the parser and everything, you you at some point

you you understand how programing in general works like, you know, you have text, you

tokenize it, you give it to some compiler and it does ast things and then bytecode, and then you

have like a vcm something bytecode execution. Bam.

01:06:11:18 - 01:06:43:09

Jens

Like it's, it's actually not so hard to implement your own programing language. It's a lot of fun.

You can learn a lot from that. Ultimately, you know, as a programmer, if you if you want to make

a good career, I think, one one very important thing is, is, you need to get along with other

people like wundergraph it it it doesn't it wouldn't exist if we were not such a great team like we

have.

01:06:43:15 - 01:07:15:19
Jens

You who who's, person that that is very good in socializing. You you can you can interview other

people. Very well. You can talk to other people very Well, you have a cool dog. And, it's true.

You you need someone who who does the the background work, like contracts and everything.
