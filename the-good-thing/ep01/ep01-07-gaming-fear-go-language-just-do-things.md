summary: |
  Jens shares how he moved from Java to Go for a simpler backend programming experience, but also confesses to spending a month dodging coding by playing the strategy game Anno 1600 out of fear and imposter syndrome. Hiding the game from his future mother-in-law while pretending to program, he eventually hit a breakthrough that led to a real understanding of programming and debugging. Stefan reflects on the power of learning by doing, comparing Jens' journey to kicking a soccer ball instead of just reading about the sport—affirming that the best way to learn is often to just start.

Jens

And you the, the frameworks like spring and others, it's a bit heavyweight. So I, I also I, I found

go and then I learned the go programing language which was much more lightweight and I, I

kind of enjoyed that. And you know, one, one funny anecdote I still remember is so in the early

days of, of Shakealert, so my wife was studying and after my accident I had like a lot of free

time and I couldn't do so many things.

00:20:39:29 - 00:21:07:11

Jens

So I, I, I, was living a while in the, in the house of the parents of my now wife, and I still

remember my wife was was away. Think she was working or something? My wife's mother was

at the house, and I kind of set my space up in the living room, and there was, like, a big wooden

table.

00:21:07:11 - 00:21:34:21

Jens

And that was kind of like my working place. And I had a laptop, and I pretended to be

programing, but actually I was playing like, strategy game. It's called, NO1600. I don't know if

you if, you know, I know it's it's, very famous in Germany because I, you know, I had like, fear of

not understanding programing.

00:21:34:28 - 00:22:00:20Jens

So for like a month or something, I really had a lot of fear that I would not make it. And so

instead of trying to learn how to program, I, I kept falling back into gaming because that

somehow, I don't know, it's helped me get through the day. And oh, but whenever my wife's

mother came around, I was like, fuck, let's I need to, I need to move the game to the side.

00:22:00:20 - 00:22:21:04

Jens

And, I need to get back to programing. And yeah, I think it took me like a month or something.

And suddenly it it clicked and, and I think, when, when I got my, my head around programing

and debugging and these kind of things, I. Yeah, I started a very interesting career.

00:22:21:06 - 00:22:41:08

Stefan

And that's the most amazing thing if you've been seeing recently like on social media with like,

Sam Altman and like all these successful entrepreneurs, they've been saying this, saying which

is you can just do things. And when I was in college, we had this professor. He was only there

for a year, but he was amazing. And he said the programing is a lot like soccer.

00:22:41:08 - 00:22:59:04

Stefan

Like, you can read about it, you can go to games and you can watch it. You can go on YouTube.

But the only way you're actually going to get good at it is by kicking the ball around. And I like

your story because you didn't go and read about it. You watched a little bit of SlideNerd, but you

you had a problem and you needed a solution to it, which involved programing.

00:22:59:04 - 00:23:12:17

Stefan

And so you just jumped right into it and you were like, you know what? We need a back end. We

need to build for. And you just kind of just did it. And so you really can just do things. And then

now you kind of built this foundation of programing that came from a problem that you really
