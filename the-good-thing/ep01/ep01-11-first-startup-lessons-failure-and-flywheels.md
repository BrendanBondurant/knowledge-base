summary: Jens shares why his first startup failed. He admits he built an app just
  to build an app rather than starting with a clear customer problem. The goal was
  to connect students with local deals via restaurants and shops, but he avoided direct
  sales, which turned out to be critical. When the team finally tried selling, it
  proved nearly impossible to get local merchants to pay even 25 dollars per month.
  They also assumed merchants would post deals themselves like on Instagram, but technical
  and behavioral friction killed that idea. Despite getting small traction in one
  city, the business was not scalable.

Jens

So the the the the big problem I think was so I, I actually wanted to build an app. So I didn't start

a startup or a business with the idea of creating a business. I started the startup with the idea of

creating an app, and that is the first big mistake you can make because you're, you're and this is

also, you see it everywhere, like, you see so many solutions today.

00:33:26:29 - 00:33:53:18

Jens

And they say, we're AI with something. So people are like, okay, I build something with AI that

that is ultimately it's the easiest way to, to mess up your startup because, you need to start with

the problem. And, so I thought back then that the, the big problem is that students don't have

access to, to good deals in the, in the city.

00:33:53:20 - 00:34:22:20

Jens

And I thought if, if we could connect shops and, and and or restaurants and, and and students

with deals, I thought that would be a huge business because we have restaurants and shops

and students and people with smartphones. We have them everywhere. So billion dollar idea,

right? It's it's very simple. And, the, the, the one thing I really liked is, programing.

00:34:22:22 - 00:34:57:00

Jens

The thing I didn't like so much is actually walking through the streets, going into the restaurants

and selling something to people. And, after a while, we kind of like, I mean, we we were

students. We didn't. Burn any any money, we we we were living at home. But after a while, we

had some, some, some pressure, because we, we needed to progress with, with the company

and it felt like we had like three K in the bank or something.

00:34:57:00 - 00:35:24:08Jens

And, eventually it was running out, so we needed to make revenue. And so I had to go out, go

into the restaurants and sell them something. And when we started doing that, we kind of

realized we will never going to make it, because have you ever tried selling something to

restaurants or shops in the streets? Like it's it's the absolute hardest thing.

00:35:24:11 - 00:36:02:09

Jens

You want to sell them a subscription for like 25 bucks per month or something, and it's almost

impossible. And we kind of figured out how to sell this to like 30 people in one city with a lot of

students. So we kind of got it. We kind of got it out, but then we ran into the next problem

because we made an assumption that if we build an app and we give this app to the restaurants

and to the shops, they would take a photo of whatever deal they want to make and they would

post this deal like Instagram in our cool app.

00:36:02:11 - 00:36:29:28

Jens

Yeah, yeah, that didn't happen because they didn't. They were like, oh, I cannot log in. I need

help. Like my my camera is broken. Like we ran into so many issues and like just from a

logistics point of view, from a go to market point of view, we kind of realized, if you can make

this concept work in one city, you have to put like, you know, think about it like, like, like a
