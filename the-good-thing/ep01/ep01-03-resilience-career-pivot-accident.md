summary: Jens reflects on how a traumatic motorcycle accident gave him perspective
  that shaped his emotional resilience as a founder. He recounts how recovery challenges—like
  relearning to walk—dwarfed startup stress, making failures like losing a deal seem
  manageable. Stefan relates with his own injury experience, prompting Jens to share
  how he discovered programming during his bedridden recovery. A German career rehabilitation
  program helped him retrain into IT, starting as a Windows Server administrator before
  moving on to more fulfilling paths.

Jens

And, just a while ago, we had a discussion with, with, venture capitalists, and they had a dinner

with us and they wanted to know about us. And one thing I mentioned is, if you almost lose your

leg and you have to re learn to walk and all that kind of stuff, and then you have a bad day in

your startup, it's not a never going to be as bad as almost losing your leg.

00:07:08:16 - 00:07:36:16

JensSo it's kind of okay if you lose a deal or something, or if something goes wrong because you,

you kind of have learned that there are things that are much worse, and then somehow you

figured out how to how to walk again, and somehow you figured out your life with, with a broken

leg and whatever. So we will also figure out how to how to move on with with WunderGraph if

we lose a deal or something.

00:07:36:16 - 00:07:42:16

Jens

So I think this really helped me to, to build some, some good resilience.

00:07:42:18 - 00:07:59:25

Stefan

Yeah. And I would totally agree. We'll dive a little bit later because I think that's a commonality

between founders. I also have an injury story. Not as bad as Jens, but it completely changed the

trajectory of my life. But what's really interesting is, yeah, and let's go back in time a little bit. So

you how old were you?

00:07:59:25 - 00:08:18:10

Stefan

You were about 18 when that accident happened and you were about to be a carpenter. Yep. So

18. You know, the world is your oyster. You just you know, you're out there in this horrible

accident, happens to you. And I remember you told me this when we first started out is, you had

no programing experience. Nothing. So you were bedridden.

00:08:18:10 - 00:08:35:13

Stefan

You had to wait for your surgery, and you told me that you started watching some YouTube

videos on programing, and you were like, that seems pretty cool. And then you just started

building. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you started your engineering or programing,

experience in based off of your accident? What happened?

00:08:35:16 - 00:09:00:06

Jens

Yeah. So after the accident theres like. And so I'm, I'm born and living in Germany, so there's,

there's a, like, like a program in Germany. We call this,, I don't know what's the right terminology

in, in English, but essentially that's like an official program that helps you get from one job that

you cannot do anymore into another job.

00:09:00:08 - 00:09:05:12

Jens

So it's kind of like doing, doing, like,

00:09:05:15 - 00:09:07:13

Stefan

The career rehabilitation.

00:09:07:16 - 00:09:32:21Jens

Right? Yeah. Yeah, you could say, you could say that. And I did that for two years. And then I,

retrained. And then I was like a systems administrator. So now I could administrate Windows

Server 2003 or something like. Not bad. I know I don't want to offend anybody, but it wasn't the

the the dream job.

00:09:32:24 - 00:10:02:17

Jens

And, after that, I worked for, government agency and, kind of one thing that that, happened after

my accident, like, before the accident, I had, like, extremely bad grades. I, I was fighting with my

with my dad all the time, and I just wanted to to leave our, our house and, our relationship
