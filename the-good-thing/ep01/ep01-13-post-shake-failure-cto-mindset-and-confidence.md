  - title inflation in startups
  - bold mindset after failure
summary: Jens describes what happened after Shakealert shut down. With new programming
  skills and inflated confidence from running a startup, he entered the job market
  as a junior developer. He quickly felt underpaid and began looking for better offers.
  Despite his lack of formal experience, he applied for higher level roles and aimed
  for 70 to 75 K salaries by presenting himself persuasively. Stefan jokes about the
  startup effect where founders assume inflated titles like CEO or CTO too early.
  Jens admits that he pitched roles like architect to employers who just needed someone
  to believe in his enthusiasm and potential.

Stefan

Apps are extremely tough. So you definitely learned a lot there, which was, hey, not only do you

just build the app and they come, which is what every founder thinks. It's like, oh, you know,

everybody has an iPhone. We just need to build an app and don't worry, we'll make $1 billion.

But I like that. And so shekels, you know, I met you were in college and then it ended up, you

know, shutting down.

00:39:37:01 - 00:39:45:12

Stefan

Where did you go next? Did you start another startup? Did you go into engineering? What

happened there?

00:39:45:14 - 00:40:09:28

Jens

So now I could program and, yeah, I, I, I found, a place where I could work, like, junior dev, but

very soon, I mean, I was still at this, bold statement phase. I know every, like, I build a startup,

like I'm a CTO, right?00:40:10:01 - 00:40:31:20

Stefan

Basically. I mean, I went real quick. Funny note, though, is, Jens when, we were traveling for a

retreat and, they asked Jens, like, what is your occupation? And hands was like, I'm a CEO

now. But then you remember when you were telling me he's like, I felt weird saying, I'm a CEO

of five people because we were a startup.

00:40:31:20 - 00:40:47:27

Stefan

And that's the that's the startup thing that it does to you is like, oh, I built a startup. Therefore,

now I'm a CTO because of all the crazy experience that I have. And so you had this bold

mindset and then you jumped into it. And where was the first job? Was this at Tonline or where

did you jump into as a junior?

00:40:47:29 - 00:41:16:06

Jens

So the the the funny thing is, I think, so I had this junior dev job where they were paying me, I

don't know, 30, 40 K or something like by by German standard. That's okay. Good. At least back

then. But I after after what wundergraph failed. No, after shake failed, I was like, okay, I need to

to up my, my salary.

00:41:16:10 - 00:41:52:14

Jens

And I was thinking that I should earn like 60, 70 K or whatever. I mean, I was very confident, not

very experienced, but, but confident and and, Yeah, the, the, the company that knew me as a

junior, they, they offered me something I think 50, 60 K and I just thought like, that's, I'm worth

more, I'm, I'm looking around and then I found some, some other positions where they were

hiring for, like, a senior dev or something.

00:41:52:14 - 00:42:16:22

Jens

Like, I wasn't really, like a senior, but I was, I think I was good at, representing myself, like,

getting. Yeah. Kind of. I mean, you you just need to find a greater fool. Like, you're right. You

need someone who needs to fill a position, and you need to sell them the dream that we can

make it work and,

00:42:16:25 - 00:42:46:28

Jens

Yeah. No. So I, I think I found the position that they wanted to pay me, like, 75 K or something.

That was really good, actually. And, but I also applied for another position where they were

looking for, like, an architect. I mean, I, I really wasn't ready for that kind of job, but it was

exciting. It was interesting because I thought, okay, as an architect, I can have more impact, on
