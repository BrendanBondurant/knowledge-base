summary: Jens explains how the core problem with his first startup was the need to
  manually spin up a flywheel in each new city, since neither merchants nor students
  would engage without the other. This lack of transferability made scaling impossible.
  Stefan compares it to the Airbnb story, where early listings had poor photos until
  the founders flew out and took professional shots themselves. That effort jumpstarted
  one side of the marketplace. Both agree that marketplace models require focused
  traction on one side first, and scaling usually involves heavy, non scalable effort
  early on.

Jens

You set up a flywheel in one city. You put a lot of energy in to, to get because you have a

chicken egg problem. You put in a lot of energy to spin the wheel, to get shops to sign up and

post a deal. Okay. Then you have to go to the other side of the market and you get you need to

get in the the students to keep the flywheel going.

00:36:54:04 - 00:37:22:25

Jens

And then you really need to to hope that both students and shops find the whole flywheel so

attractive that they keep spinning this thing by themselves, which didn't really work. And the next

problem is you set up this flywheel in one city, and unfortunately, you cannot copy this into the

next city. You have to set up a whole new flywheel in the next city and spin it up yourself.

00:37:22:25 - 00:37:53:14

Jens

And from a go to market, it's it's not. I build an app once I scale it out and it's the same thing for

everybody. It's, it's it's an absolute nightmare. In go to market. Yeah. But it, it helped me to

program apps and websites and backends and yeah, I learned programing through this and I, I

learned a lot about go to market or not how to do it.

00:37:53:16 - 00:38:16:27

Stefan

And what I think is important about that. For those of you that don't know the story of Airbnb, thisis very similar because what jens had was a basically a marketplace. You need two people on

there, you need the restaurants, and then you need the college students. And if you do a little

research on marketplace apps, the only way they really succeed is if the company that's

building that app puts extreme effort onto one side.

00:38:16:27 - 00:38:39:06

Stefan

You have to have either the restaurants fully on it or the students, because once you have one,

the other ones will come. And what happened with Airbnb is they did the same thing. So they

opened Airbnb bed and breakfast, and they released the app and they saw that the, the

restaurants or the, the hotel people that were posting their pictures, that they were horrible, the

pictures were horrible.

00:38:39:06 - 00:38:58:02

Stefan

They were taken in with horrible quality. So Paul Graham told them, you need to do things that

don't scale. And so what they did is they bought tickets, they flew to where their customers are,

and they took professional photos and they put so much effort into making these look like, like

hotel quality photos. And once they built that side of the motion, people started seeing the

picture.

00:38:58:02 - 00:39:17:09

Stefan

They started seeing the quality. Then the other flywheel happened where the customers that

were looking to stay a places started to come. And it's exactly what you said, because they had

to fly to every single city individually, because one flywheel that works in Boston didn't work in
