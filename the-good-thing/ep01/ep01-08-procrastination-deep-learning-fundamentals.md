summary: 'Stefan introduces the idea from the book *Originals* that procrastination
  can aid learning, noting that Jens’ mix of gaming and programming may have supported
  retention. He then emphasizes that new developers should just start building, especially
  with tools like ChatGPT and Cursor now available. This leads into a discussion of
  what sets Jens apart: his commitment to going deep into topics like compilers, runtimes,
  and network internals. Jens contrasts surface-level frontend deployment with true
  understanding, emphasizing that even in the AI age, foundational knowledge remains
  critical.'

Stefan

Originals?

I like that. And then the second point I wanted to make is, have you read the book The

00:23:18:26 - 00:23:20:10

Jens

I don't think so.

00:23:20:12 - 00:23:41:26

Stefan

So it's, it's an amazing book and it's about, like, original thinking and what you were actually

doing with, the procrastinating with the video games. It's actually very positive. Usually when

you're learning something and you procrastinate, it can help you retain more information in abetter way because of what you were doing. So you were programing when your mom was,

when your mother in law was walking around, and then you were video gaming.

00:23:41:26 - 00:23:53:25

Stefan

And so that, like, mix between procrastinating and programing, you were helping retain

knowledge. So I wonder if that's how, like, you were able to learn within a month or a half. But

it's definitely an interesting antidote. I really like that. And then.

00:23:53:25 - 00:23:58:08

Jens

LinkedIn would say fascinating information.

00:23:58:10 - 00:24:01:07

Stefan

Or good insight. Good insight. I think they would say.

00:24:01:09 - 00:24:03:06

Jens

Good insight, yes.

00:24:03:08 - 00:24:21:08

Stefan

But to all the, let's say like junior engineers or people just starting out their career, the best way

to get started with programing is you really can just do things, just start building things. And now

with chat, GPT and cursor, you can use it as a I guess partner. You could ask it to help teach

you things, help explain things to you.

00:24:21:13 - 00:24:40:26

Stefan

And I think that's super beneficial. And something that AI is going to help change is how we

learn programing. With that though, I want to transition into something that you kind of taught

me. So yes, you're a self-taught programmer. I've met a lot of self-taught programmers, but

there's something fundamentally different about you. It's that exact word right there.

00:24:40:26 - 00:25:02:09

Stefan

Fundamentally, you stressed that the most important thing about learning is that you went deep

into topics. You went deep into understanding how things worked, like compilers, runtime

computers in general and networks and things like that. Can you talk to us a little bit about like

what that process was like, especially learning on you went deep into topics and you understood

it from the ground up and then it helped build your foundation.

00:25:02:09 - 00:25:07:16

Stefan

Can you can you explain a little bit more what you meant by that? When you explain that to me?00:25:07:19 - 00:25:41:27

Jens

I think one of the problems we or I often see these days with, with, younger developers is they,

they look into some tutorials or say they look into some, some YouTube stuff. They see react

and they build some react and they deploy it on Vercel. And then they are like, okay, I'm a

developer. And I think what what is fundamentally missing in this path is understanding the

fundamentals.

00:25:41:27 - 00:26:23:19

Jens

Like how does the web work, how do programing languages work and all this kind of stuff. And I,

I don't know if everybody's like that, but for me, it was always important. If I do something, I truly

understand it. Like, I, I, you know, like ChatGPT it, it just gives you the next possible character.

And it's sometimes it's really great in suggesting some code, but I think it's still important even in

the, in the age of, of AI, it's still very important to understand what is going on and, and what is
