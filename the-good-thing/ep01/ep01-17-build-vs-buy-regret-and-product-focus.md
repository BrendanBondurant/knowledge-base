summary: Jens shares how the bare metal Kubernetes effort and the custom CMS project
  eventually became unsustainable under real business pressure. He admits that while
  it was fun and technically impressive, it did not support revenue or user growth.
  Stefan expands on this with an observation common across companies building internal
  platforms that go unfinished and leave teams burdened. The lesson is not just technical
  but organizational. Jens emphasizes that experienced engineers should get close
  to product owners and customers to understand what really moves the business forward.
  Building something for fun is not the same as building what matters.

Jens

And, yeah, alongside with our bare metal Kubernetes, that, that was a very enjoyable time untilthe pressure of the business side came, came to a point where it really was clear, like, we we

wouldn't figure it out. And, Yeah, eventually I, I left that that shit show. But it's, I wouldn't say it

was just me like that.

00:53:59:06 - 00:54:13:03

Jens

There were other clueless people involved, but I think I was, How do you say that? I was very

good at convincing other people of doing the wrong things.

00:54:13:05 - 00:54:34:26

Stefan

I mean, you also got yourself a job as an architect, as a junior, so I could definitely see that. But

definitely makes sense. But, there's so much to unpack here because it's so important is that,

like, I'm not even saying this as to sell WunderGraph Cosmo, but I understand why developers

want to build it. Like I said, gateways are cool, Federation solutions are cool.

00:54:34:28 - 00:54:55:09

Stefan

CMSs are cool. Running your own, on bare metal. That's cool. But the thing is, is when you left,

you kind of left a little bomb as well, because now what do they do with and we see this all the

time, is that somebody wants to build their own solution halfway through. They don't even

understand the complexity of it.

00:54:55:09 - 00:55:10:18

Stefan

They don't see all the use cases that they could. There's no way they could have seen because

they've never done it before. And then halfway through, they just leave and they leave it with the

team that's left there, and they have to pick up the scraps versus just using a vendor. And so I

think you learned a lot of valuable lessons there.

00:55:10:18 - 00:55:28:28

Stefan

And we and we always use the story when we talk with customers that like go ahead, try and

build it yourself. But here are the things that you might run into. There's also issues that we don't

even know yet. Now we're running into now with building this. But you should always, always,

always when you're looking at build versus buy, take it very seriously.

00:55:29:00 - 00:55:32:04

Stefan

And I think that's an important lesson there. And we are. Can I add.

00:55:32:04 - 00:55:33:05

Jens

Something.

00:55:33:07 - 00:55:36:05

StefanOf course. Go ahead.

00:55:36:07 - 00:56:05:09

Jens

I think if you have a few years of experience, the the most important learning you have to make

is in this build versus buy that often times engineers convince management that they can build

something because they want to build this, not because they know how to build this, and also

not because they understand that building it would actually benefit the business.

00:56:05:11 - 00:56:09:16

Jens

And I think.

00:56:09:18 - 00:56:33:16

Jens

I think if you want to be, a really good engineer, what you should be doing is get close to the

head of product or to the to the product owner or whatever team you're assigned to. Get close

to those people and try to understand the vision of your product. Like what are what is your

company concerned about?

00:56:33:18 - 00:57:05:08

Jens

Get close to your customers, understand what they are doing, and work on these kind of

projects. Projects that have like real customer facing like ARR impact things and like building a

Kubernetes on top of bare metal or building our own, our own content management system.

These were not things that had, like this impact on the business.
