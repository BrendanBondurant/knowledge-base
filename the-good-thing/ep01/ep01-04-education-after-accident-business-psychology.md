summary: |
  Jens describes the turning point in his recovery when he decided that life as a systems administrator wasn’t enough. Motivated to pursue something greater, he attended night school five nights a week and Saturdays, transforming from a poor-performing student to one earning top grades. This earned him a general qualification (comparable to a U.S. associate’s degree), which led him to a private university where he studied business psychology while working. The segment highlights his persistence, non-traditional path, and determination to reorient his life after trauma. Stefan adds color with anecdotes from Jens’ raver past.

Jens

It's great. But I had to figure out some some stuff for myself, and. Yeah, essentially, after the

accident, I kind of woke up. I was like, okay, life is real. I have to I have to start something like, I

cannot stay a Systems administrator. That's that's not my thing. And so I went to night school.

And in night school, this was like, five evenings per week.

00:10:29:14 - 00:10:55:24

Jens

And, Saturdays, couple hours. And so every, like, for two years, every evening I went to night

school from, I think 5 p.m. until eight or whatever, and then even on the weekends. So it was, it

was really hard, but I, I wanted to do it. And what was interesting in school, like in, in like regular

school, I completely fucked it up.

00:10:55:24 - 00:11:17:05

Jens

Like, I like my grades were, were so bad and in night school all I did was I, I, I went there and I

actually listened and I participated. And then I, my, I had like, one point, one grade, like 1.0 is

the best. 1.1 is, is kind of like second best.

00:11:17:07 - 00:11:19:13

Stefan

I was going to say that's just horrible in the United States.

00:11:19:13 - 00:11:40:01

Jens

By the way. Yeah. No, but by German standards. So that's the second best grade you can have.

And I had that by actually going there and listening and paying attention. And then that like, you

know, there were like like, courses like, like for the physics and other things and maths and I just

enjoyed it and it was great.

00:11:40:01 - 00:11:59:09

Jens

And everybody was a bit more, you know, there's typically like just adult adults and so peopledidn't bully you or something. You could just yeah, do school. And it worked great for me. So I

then, had my, my degree there, there after two years. And then I.

00:11:59:09 - 00:12:02:24

Stefan

Tell us about the degree, because it wasn't a technical degree. Right.

00:12:02:26 - 00:12:15:01

Jens

No. That was just like the, the, the school degree we call this. I don't know, it's not like, what's it

called in, in in the, us, I think.

00:12:15:06 - 00:12:21:27

Stefan

door right.

I think in the US, it's an associate. So just like general studies, just to kind of get your foot in the

00:12:22:00 - 00:12:26:17

Jens

Yeah. But how do you do you call it high school or something.

00:12:26:19 - 00:12:30:22

Stefan

Well high school is before college and so you like, you can I.

00:12:30:22 - 00:12:33:23

Jens

Think it's kind of like a college degree or something.

00:12:33:25 - 00:12:38:26

Stefan

Yeah. So I think you did like, what we would call community college or like, an associate's

degree to start with some.

00:12:38:28 - 00:13:06:28

Jens

Yeah, maybe. Maybe something. And then after that, I went to, to, like, private university where I

could, study, bachelor's degree. And I again, I did this beside the, the, the job because I wanted

to have an income. So again, it was in the, in the evenings and on the weekends for two years.

And then I had, bachelor's degree of, business psychology.

00:13:07:01 - 00:13:23:14

Stefan

Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like, your life is so interesting because you had this traumatic

accident and we didn't talk a little bit about your past, but Jens was an active raver, so he loved

going to the discotheque, especially in his teens. He would stay there till six in the morning. We
