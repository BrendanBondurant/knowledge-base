00:26:23:19 - 00:26:46:04

Jens

And yeah. Like how does Http work? How do headers work and all these kind of things and, and

what is it TCP connection. What is TLS and why do we need encryption and all these. I think it's

useful to understand the, the, the basics. And I think if you, if you leverage like leveraging AI is

great.

00:26:46:07 - 00:27:09:08

Jens

But it's very important to understand the fundamentals. And at the same time AI is so good at

helping you to understand the fundamentals. You can you can ask possibly any questions like if

you have VS code for example, you can just you can you can mark some code. You can ask

copilot to explain it to you.

00:27:09:11 - 00:27:13:10

Jens

So yeah, yeah. Well said.

00:27:13:12 - 00:27:35:08

Stefan

And I'm reading an interesting book right now. It's like the history of engineering and science.

And one of the key points from the story is that every 17 years, libraries need to double up on

their knowledge. They need to bring double the amount of books that they had within the 17

years. And then with technical knowledge, they say every 15 years, half of it becomes obsolete.

00:27:35:10 - 00:27:56:08

Stefan

And so if you keep that in mind, it's especially important to understand the fundamentals,

because if you understand the fundamentals, technology is ever changing. It's changing every

single year, especially with AI. But the fundamentals rarely change. We're still using Http, we'restill using the internet. We're still using all these type of foundations that we've set from the 90s

up until this point.

00:27:56:10 - 00:28:14:06

Stefan

But from the 90s to now, things have dramatically changed. We have framework works. We

don't have to write, compiler code. Everything is just completely changed. But the fundamentals

stay the same. And I really think that's important. And, for the audience, there was a book that

you recommended to me when you were starting out your journey. For self-taught programmers.

00:28:14:06 - 00:28:18:12

Stefan

What was that book? Do you remember?

00:28:18:14 - 00:28:21:17

Jens

Good question.

00:28:21:20 - 00:28:34:20

Stefan

I think it was like engineering for self-taught or it was a book that, like a self-taught developer

created. And you said it really helped your career. If you don't remember, we can also posted in

the comments later.

00:28:34:22 - 00:28:38:21

Jens

Yeah, I need to think about it.

00:28:38:24 - 00:29:00:21

Stefan

No worries, we'll post it in the comments later for you guys. But this is a book that Jens really

recommended that helped him with his journey, kind of help them with the foundations. And then

it's actually a book he still references to this day. But, okay, cool. So interesting enough, in

Germany you started a startup, which, if you guys know anything about Europe, not very

forward focused, you know, decided to start a startup.

00:29:00:21 - 00:29:13:28

Stefan

But Shakels eventually failed. Walk us through your first, I guess, startup failure and what you

decided to do after that. And I think you're looking up the book, aren't you?

00:29:14:00 - 00:29:15:29

Jens

Yeah. I just found the book.

00:29:16:01 - 00:29:19:08

StefanOkay. Backtrack. What was the book called?

00:29:19:10 - 00:29:55:17

Jens

Okay. So here. Wait, I send you an. So this is a link. Big machine. And it's it's so funny because

the the book is the imposters handbook, and I, I really like the, the title because for a very long

time in my career, I felt like an imposter because, you can grow a career in programing very fast
