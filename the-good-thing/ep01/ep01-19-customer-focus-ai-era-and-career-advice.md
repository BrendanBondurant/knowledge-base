Stefan

And the team just kind of took a step back and they were like, why do you want to talk to the

customers? And I think if you're early in your career and I think one of the best thing about

working, at Wunder Graph is how close you actually are to the customer. And if you can find a

job where you're close to customers or what Amazon does is that they put, everything single

engineer on customer service, I think at least once a month.

01:00:43:18 - 01:01:01:15

Stefan

I think that's a really good place to be because building is fun, but building for your customers is

what's important and actually is more fun because you get feedback, you get joy from them

using it. And I think, Jens, you taught a very valuable lesson there, especially if you're early on

in your career, is look at what you're building and look at who you're building for.

01:01:01:18 - 01:01:28:12Stefan

I think that's a crucial differentiator, and we are almost at time. So what I'll do is I'll ask one final

question and what we'll do next week as we're going to be doing this every Friday at 9 a.m. is

we're gonna do part two of Jens, which is he joined TYK, which was this new and hot startup in

the API management space, and he basically led them to a series B by building out their entire

GraphQL platform and creating what is the catalyst of WUnderGraph Cosmo, which is GraphQL

go tools.

01:01:28:14 - 01:01:49:29

Stefan

It's what our router is powered by. It's where we met Sergei, our amazing first engineer, actually,

David. And it just kind of led to where Wunder Graph Cosmo is, but Jen's, first of all, your

background is amazing. Like, I, like I told you this before the podcast, I think people really can

learn a lot. There's a lot of lessons from your background, but not as a CEO, but as a developer.

01:01:49:29 - 01:02:15:21

Stefan

What are the most important advice that you think? You've already given us some gold nuggets,

but things that maybe a mentor told you that changed your career path or a lesson that you

learned? Not like from the bare metal. Maybe something else that you would give to junior

developers, senior developers, or anybody that wants to go from junior to architect with one

year of experience.

01:02:15:23 - 01:02:49:04

Jens

So one thing I mentioned earlier, it's it's the fundamentals. If you don't understand some

something go very deep and until you have clarity, I think it really helps you to not feel like an

imposter. Another very important thing is, and this is actually even I think it's it's even more true

in the, in the age of AI, you know, a lot of developers or young developers, they might be asking

themselves, should I learn to program?

01:02:49:06 - 01:03:28:11

Jens

And there's this, this, this guy from from Nvidia, I think the, the CEO and I, I think he, he said

something like, we we shouldn't be learning to program or something along these lines. Which

begs the question, what really is programing and if you think about programing, for me,

programing is understanding what the customer needs and turning these business
