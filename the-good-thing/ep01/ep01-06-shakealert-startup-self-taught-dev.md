summary: 'Jens describes his first hands-on experience with building a real product:
  an app called Shakealert that let users shake their phone to activate a QR code
  scanner for local deals. Initially working with a friend who knew PHP and a classmate
  building the iOS app, Jens eventually took on both backend and Android development
  himself. Motivated by the urgency of making the startup work, he turned to YouTube
  tutorials—especially Slide Nerd—to teach himself Android and backend programming
  in Java. Later, he also learned Swift, eventually realizing Java''s verbosity made
  it less appealing.'

Jens

So we we built an app, and this app, we called it Shakealert because, you could go to local

shops and if you want to have, like, super nice deal from that shop, you had to open the app

and activate the QR code scanner, to redeem the deal. And we thought, okay, let's build

something super fancy and cool.

00:17:11:27 - 00:17:41:27

Jens

So there's no button to activate the QR code scanner, but you have to shake the phone and we

use like the shake sensor. So that's why the app was called Shakealert. And, yeah. Like,

somebody had to and we can talk a little bit more how this, startup failed, but, the, the

interesting bit is so we, we we wanted to build this app, and somebody had to program the app.

00:17:41:29 - 00:18:11:09

Jens

Yeah. So for that, we needed like an iOS app and an Android app, and we needed some sort of

a backend. And I had, like an, an old friend who knew some PHP, and he was kind of like a little

bit out of the game, but it was the best bet to just work with him. And he wrote some PHP, and

then we had some some backend, but I wasn't really happy with with how that worked.

00:18:11:09 - 00:18:38:14

Jens

And it wasn't like the the pace I wanted to go. So I kind of figured, okay, I, I think I need to do it

on my own. And then I had my, my, colleague who I studied with, and we tried to, to split it up,

like where he would build like the iOS app, and I would build, the Android app, and I would buildthe backend, and somehow he couldn't get his head around programing.

00:18:38:14 - 00:19:02:07

Jens

And I kind of realized, okay, if we ever want to make this startup work out, somebody needs to

write the code. Then this somebody, it's going to be me. And, so I found, and I can, I can, I can

talk about some, some weird anecdotes here, but, that so I needed to learn to program. So

there was a YouTube channel.

00:19:02:10 - 00:19:37:26

Jens

You can you can actually look it up. I think it's still there. There's a YouTube channel, and, it's

called Slide nerd. This is a guy from India who was teaching how to program, Android apps with,

with, Java and, yeah, it was kind of cool because if you can program an Android app with Java,

you can also write, a backend in Java and so now you have one language for the backend and

the frontend and yeah.

00:19:37:26 - 00:20:07:14

Jens

After, a little while of doing that, I kind of got my, my head around, how programing works. And

then later on I also learned Swift and then I could also program, I could program iOS apps.

Yeah. And then after some other while I figured that, like, Java is cool, but it's not by my it's a bit
