summary: Jens reflects on an early moment in his career when he encountered someone
  vastly more experienced, which humbled him and changed how he spoke about technical
  topics. He ties this to the Dunning Kruger effect and the common early-career mistake
  of making bold claims. Over time, he learned the value of saying it depends as a
  marker of true seniority and perspective. Stefan builds on this by explaining how
  that shift in mindset transforms how you evaluate problems. They begin to transition
  into a discussion of Jens first startup failure and what lessons came from it.

Jens

And you, you keep. I don't know, like, depending on how long your career is, but, I had this, this

big moment where where I ran into someone who was much, much, much smarter than me. In

one area, and I was like, making, you know, when you're young, you learn something, you're on

this. What's it called? The like this Dunning-Kruger curve where you're on this learning path

where you're like, okay, I, I know a little bit about something that means I'm a master.

00:30:29:07 - 00:30:57:01

Jens

And then you run into like a real master in that area and they absolutely crush you and you kind

of realize, okay, I need to because I was making like very, very bold statements. And that's that's

typically, you know, you you can see someone is not yet a senior if they are making very bold

statements because you kind of learn that if you're too bold, eventually you run into someone,

they absolutely kill you.

00:30:57:01 - 00:31:22:20

Jens

And then you're like, you start, you know, this typical sentence like every, every senior does it

like, hey, what what is this? What is that? And they the, the typical answer is it depends because

you the more senior you are this this answer of saying it depends. It comes from you're so

senior that you know what you don't know or you know how much you don't know.

00:31:22:22 - 00:31:53:07

Jens

So you're you're kind of adjusting. You're you're the strongest of your opinion and, and and and

the likelihood that you don't know everything. And so you kind of calm down a lot. And I think

that's, it's, for me, it was a very important, learning to run into that person. And from that point

on, I, I always kind of try to better understand the topic I'm talking about.

00:31:53:07 - 00:31:58:16

Jens

Or if I don't just calm down a little bit.

00:31:58:19 - 00:32:25:21

Stefan

And I think that's really good advice, especially for junior. And I mean, developers starting out

like bold statements, you know, it's important it's important to kind of like show your mark,especially in a company you want to get, you know, promoted. But there's so much that you

don't know. And then when you have that realization of that, like, wow, there's so much that I

actually don't know, it changes your thinking fundamentally because now you start looking at

problems like, yes, this is the approach I want to take, but it also depends.

00:32:25:21 - 00:32:44:28

Stefan

And I think it's a really good transition with,. So was your first start up. That's where you learned

programing because it had to be done. What were some of the bold statements that you had,

like what was the general thesis like? You told us, the general thesis of that company you can

shake to get discounts, but why did it ultimately fail?

00:32:44:28 - 00:32:55:17

Stefan

And don't use the experience that you have now with a successful startup? Why back then did
