summary: Jens shares the story of a life-altering motorcycle accident that led to
  multiple surgeries and changed his career trajectory. No longer able to become a
  carpenter, he found new freedom through mono skiing—an adaptive sport using a sit-ski
  setup. He reflects on how his experience with injury and recovery taught him resilience
  and shaped how he approaches challenges, especially in tech.

Jens

Yeah, it depends on who you ask. But yeah, mono skiing is is one I would say one. One big part

of, of my private life, which also has kind of like, a little bit of a back story because I should have

been a carpenter, and at age 18, I was, on, kind of like a motorbike, scooter, whatever thing,

with, 125 CCM and I was on the on the way to the carpentry, and I, happened to be in the

corner that was cut by a truck, and.

00:03:21:17 - 00:03:51:00

Jens

Yeah, I got run over by a truck. And then over the next two years, I had to relearn how to walk

because I had, like, like, very complicated, or many, many very complicated surgeries with my

left knee. And, at age 18, I was very, very unsure and very insecure about my future if I would

ever walk again and everything.

00:03:51:03 - 00:04:20:21

Jens

And, yeah, I had to, to relearn that. And then after a while, I realized that, I, I wouldn't be a

carpenter anymore because as a carpenter, you have to carry, like, heavy doors and stuff likethat, more than 20 kilos. And I just couldn't carry that with, with my injured knee. These days, I

can walk again, but not so much like running or skiing or anything.

00:04:20:21 - 00:04:48:22

Jens

And then a couple of years ago, my my wife figured out that there is, something that, people in

wheelchairs do a lot, in winters sports, they have mono skis, which is you could also say sit ski.

It's kind of like you have a, like a seat where you strap yourself in and under the seat there's a

single ski, which is why we call this thing.

00:04:48:22 - 00:05:14:07

Jens

A mono ski. And then, you can imagine how hard it is to balance, like a seat on top of, like a little

chair on top of, a single ski and try to balance that down, down the hill. It's a very complicated

thing. But after a couple of years of falling over and over and over, I.

00:05:14:07 - 00:05:38:10

Jens

I kind of, stuck with it, and it's it's, it's a lot of fun. And it if you are someone with a disability and

you, you, you you can get back to these kind of things. It gives you a different level of freedom

just because it's an activity that you you cannot really do. You know, we're we're knowledge

workers.

00:05:38:13 - 00:06:07:03

Jens

And in IT, you can do so many things, even though you have disabilities, like, even if you have,

problems with hearing or visibility or you might not have your full control over your arms or

whatever, there's always some sort of solution and you can somehow use a computer and, you

can use your head and you can write programs, but you cannot participate in the, in the rest of

the life.

00:06:07:05 - 00:06:42:11

Jens

And, yeah, for me sit ski or mono ski is just it's kind of like freedom. I can I can do something

that I'm typically not doing. And, it's, it's, very enjoyable thing. And one just one thing I want to

point out is that I, I have a feeling that my, my, my, accident at, at age 18 and, the years after, it

kind of helped me to, to learn how to fail and stand up again.
