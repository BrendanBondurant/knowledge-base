Jens

We have someone who figured out how to do composition. We have someone who figured out

how to do query planning all these kind of things. I think if you if you want to build, you know,

there's this proverb, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. I would I

would slightly rephrase it, then say, if you want to build a successful startup, you just need a

bunch of people.

01:07:44:19 - 01:08:12:09

Jens

If you want to build a successful project, even at a corporate, you need a bunch of people. You

cannot do it with one person. You need five, maybe ten. Maybe the project needs 20 people. So

one thing if you ever want to be part of a successful project, you need to be a person that other

people like to work with because you, you you don't want to be the the douchebag that

everybody hates and nobody wants to work with you.

01:08:12:09 - 01:08:40:00

Jens

And and, that's that's very hard. So somehow figure out how can you collaborate and work

together with others. And that's that's ultimately where we're also coming back to what we're

currently doing at wundergraph. We're focusing on on collaboration because I think, a very big

thing in tech is we need to help people to collaborate and work together.

01:08:40:02 - 01:09:03:22

Jens

And, Federation is a great foundation to enable collaboration across teams, build platforms

where multiple teams can work together on APIs, can can discuss, API schemas and, how they

want to make changes and all these kind of things. And that's, that's that's where we are.

01:09:03:24 - 01:09:25:04

Stefan

Yeah. And I think it's a great way to end the episode. So a little hint of where we're going

towards in 2025. Jens. As always amazing. Co-host I'm excited for the next episode. So next

episode, next Friday at 9 a.m.. We're going to be talking about Jenssecond half of the journey,

which was tyk, some fun stuff that we went through in the early days, raising money and where

we are currently going.

01:09:25:04 - 01:09:40:00

Stefan

01:09:40:00 - 01:09:58:14

Stefan
