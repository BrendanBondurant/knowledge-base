Stefan

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an episode of The Good Thing, episode one, where we're

gonna be interviewing Jens Neuse. For those of you that don't know, Jens is my co-founder

CEO. And what I like to say on the call is the technical co-founder of, wunder graph. And most of

you don't know Jens.

00:00:19:20 - 00:00:40:04

Stefan

Maybe you know him from Twitter or from LinkedIn. And it's kind of interesting because he has

actually an amazing background. And I don't think a lot of people know about it or know how he

got into technology, into APIs, and why he's such a big advocate for GraphQL. So, Jens, thank

you so much for joining me. And also, Jens will be my co-host going forward onto these podcast

that we're going to be having guests.

00:00:40:07 - 00:00:48:18

Stefan

We're going to be talking a lot. Just so kind of about the good things in software development,

GraphQL API and what's going on at wonder graph. But Jens, thank you so much for joining me.

00:00:48:21 - 00:00:54:03

Jens

Okay. Can you do the the intro we do in the sales call. Like when when you intro me.

00:00:54:05 - 00:01:06:15

Stefan

Yeah I can hi guys. My name is Stefan. I'm the co-founder chief customer officer here I'm joined

by Jens he is our CEO and technical founder. Any technical questions you have Jens will be

able to address.

00:01:06:17 - 00:01:14:04

Jens

Yeah. I'm it's it's always funny that I'm. I'm just here to answer your technical questions

essentially.

00:01:14:07 - 00:01:27:02

Stefan

Yeah. Basically. And that's what you'll be doing on this podcast as well. So I'll just be talking to

you. And when there's a technical question about Federation or composition, I'll just default it to

you just the same way we do in the sales calls.

00:01:27:04 - 00:01:44:06

Stefan

Amazing. But yeah guys, so happy New Year and what we'll be doing on this podcast. And thereason why it's called the good thing is, is we have another co-founder. His name is Bjorn. He's

a very positive guy already, and we just talk a little bit about the story, which is that.

00:01:44:11 - 00:01:44:20

Jens

Okay.

00:01:44:20 - 00:02:03:13

Stefan

Every time something bad happened, he would somehow say, the good thing is and he would

find the good thing. And what I realized with my background of working at wundergraph and

working with such talented engineers is that software engineering is all about trade offs. And the

reason we decided with the good thing is, is because with every trade off, there is a good thing.

00:02:03:20 - 00:02:19:09

Stefan

And so that's why we named the podcast The Good Thing, because we want to talk about what

are the trade offs that we have to make in engineering. What are the trade offs you have to

make when you choose GraphQL? What are the trade offs you have to make just in life? And

today we're going to be talking about Jens and just kind of like your background.

00:02:19:11 - 00:02:32:04

Stefan

Some of the things that people don't know is that you're an avid dancer. They don't know that

you enjoy really good techno music. They don't know about your story. They don't also know

that you're almost a professional mono skier. Would you say you're a professional or not at that

level?
