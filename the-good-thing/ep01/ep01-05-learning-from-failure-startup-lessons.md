summary: Jens recalls being encouraged by a boss to learn programming but struggling with Perl to the point of giving up. Stefan comments on how many exceptional engineers are self-taught, framing Jens’ journey as proof. Jens then describes meeting Alexandra, his future wife, and starting a company with her and a classmate, marking his first step into entrepreneurship despite limited technical skills

Stefan

No, he just liked the music and he was there till 6:00 pounding beers. But after the accident you

woke up, you start working as a systems administrator, and then you go to college and you don't

even get a degree in technology. But you got a business psychology degree, correct?

00:13:39:25 - 00:14:07:19

Jens

Well, I, I never really thought about working in IT or anything. I, I didn't like it. I mean, being a

systems administrator, it's it's very boring. And I keep remembering there was like, well, one of

my bosses, he was a very smart guy, and, he, he kind of told me Jens, if you ever want to, to

get somewhere, with your career, you need to learn to program.

00:14:07:19 - 00:14:29:10

Jens

You can't just administrate servers. You need to write programs to administrate servers. That's

much more interesting. You need to automate the things. He he was writing Perl scripts, and,

you know, like, a very smart guy writing Perl, whatever. Like, nobody will do this today. But he

was very smart. And, I looked at some Perl. It just didn't make sense to me.

00:14:29:10 - 00:14:40:08

Jens

I couldn't figure out how to how to program. And I, I just gave up and accepted that, I will

probably never be a programmer.

00:14:40:10 - 00:15:02:20

Stefan

And that's so weird. And I think there's a really important lesson here is that, so for those of you

that don't know my background, I studied computer science and economics, and we have a joke

at wundergraph that I was probably the worst engineer you've ever met. I had a technical

background, but all of the engineers at wundergraph most of them, I would say, or even self-

taught or they just have some formal training.

00:15:02:23 - 00:15:19:11

Stefan

But for me, I fundamentally believe this is that the best engineers are self-taught and at that

point in your life Jens you were trying to go with Perl, you were kind of struggling with a little bit

of it. What changed? Because you do have a programing background and you're one of the

best engineers that I know, but what changed at that moment?

00:15:19:11 - 00:15:26:11

Stefan

You tried it out, you couldn't do it. But then what did you do to actually learn programing?

00:15:26:14 - 00:15:44:05

JensSo I was, I was, I was working full time. I studied business psychology and, I was dating all the

time. Of course you're.

00:15:44:07 - 00:15:44:23

Stefan

Okay.

00:15:44:23 - 00:16:18:09

Jens

You're you're dating, and, I am. I met a, very interesting girl, that, was studying, in, So I was

living in Frankfurt, and she was studying in Giessen, which is, I don't know, 20, 30, 40km away,

which is by German standards, not so far. And I met her in Frankfurt, and, she's now my my

wife, Alexandra, and we,

00:16:18:12 - 00:16:46:15

Jens

Yeah, we we we started a relationship together. And after a while, together with one other,

colleague, which I studied with, business psychology, we we started a startup because we we

always thought it's exciting to build our own company, and that that company, was, Yeah, it was

a weird company, but, it was a cool experience.
