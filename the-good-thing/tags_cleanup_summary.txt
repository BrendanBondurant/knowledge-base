TAGS CLEANUP SUMMARY
====================

WORK COMPLETED:
âœ… Fixed 4,300+ tags formatting issues across 364 files
âœ… Standardized YAML list indentation to be consistent across all sections
âœ… Identified 112 extra tags not in master list
âœ… Found 0 remaining compound tags (all were formatting issues)

FORMATTING ISSUES FIXED:
- Round 1: Fixed 1,866 issues (incorrect dash formatting)
- Round 2: Fixed 2,434 issues (inconsistent indentation between sections)
- All YAML list items now consistently use "- item" format (no extra indentation)
- All sections (participants, speakers, topics, tags, topic_tags, entities, mentions) now have consistent formatting

EXTRA TAGS ANALYSIS:
- Total master tags: 116
- Total found tags after cleanup: 216  
- Extra tags not in master: 112

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Most "compound tags" were actually formatting issues (missing proper indentation)
2. The extra tags are legitimate single tags that may need to be added to master list
3. Some YAML parsing issues remain in ~20 files due to special characters in mentions/entities
4. All core tag formatting is now consistent across the entire knowledge base

FILES CREATED:
- extra_tags_analysis.txt - Categorized list of missing tags
- final_tags_analysis.txt - Complete analysis after fixes
- tags_cleanup_summary.txt - This summary

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the 112 extra tags in final_tags_analysis.txt
2. Consider adding legitimate tags to tags_master.yaml  
3. Minor YAML issues in mentions sections can be addressed later
4. All tag formatting is now consistent and properly structured

The knowledge base now has properly formatted tags throughout! ðŸŽ‰
