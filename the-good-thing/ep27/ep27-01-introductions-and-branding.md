Jens
I. Hey, everybody. We're live. Today I do. I have to do the intro because Stefan is not here, and,
I'm not prepared to do it. I'm just winging it. Yeah, it's it's good to be, back on the stream. We
had a webinar this week already with the same round, where? Yeah, we were ten minutes late.
00:00:52:07 - 00:01:21:05
Jens
David, because we we needed some extra time for preparation, the backgrounds and
everything. So. Yeah, but it's good to be live again. Like, you know, typically we it's just me and
a good looking person, Stefan. But because we don't have Stefan today, we need to to mix
together three other good looking people. So, today, here we have, Ludwig.
00:01:21:05 - 00:01:38:14
Jens
Jesse and and Dustin and, Yeah, maybe we can. We can get a little intro. Hi, Ludwig. And,
you're you're working on the, like what? What's what what's what have you been working on for
the last couple of months?
00:01:38:16 - 00:02:03:00
Ludwig
Yeah, I've been working a lot with, making graphql into some kind of reflected gRPC messages.
So I've been working on on the engine part that would translate GraphQL messages into
dynamic protobuf messages and send them over to our gRPC services or plugins. Regarding on
this.
00:02:03:03 - 00:02:22:15
Jens
It's actually an interesting topic, and we will talk about this a little bit later. In the beginning we
thought, oh, it's gonna be easy. We just connect GraphQL to gRPC and then we dig a little bit
into this topic and we we figured out you can't easily translate everything and the messages.
And there are there are some problems.
00:02:22:15 - 00:02:30:16
Jens
But we will we will get to that. Yeah. Also on the stream today. Jesse. Hi, Jesse. How are you?
00:02:30:19 - 00:02:32:15
Jesse
Hello. I'm good.
00:02:32:18 - 00:02:36:12
Jens
What's your what's your contribution to Cosmo Connect?
00:02:36:14 - 00:02:51:27
Jesse
I worked a little bit in the very early stages of how we were going to map, the gRPC data types
to GraphQL ones. And I also worked pretty late in the project on how this integrates with Cosmo
Cloud. And your, very managed system. If you're using.
00:02:51:28 - 00:02:55:26
Jens
You're responsible for the bad naming of proto graphic, right?
00:02:55:28 - 00:02:58:28
Jesse
Yes, yes I am.
00:02:59:01 - 00:03:23:28
Jens
If anybody comes to the Cosmo monorepo and, thinks about who came up with this shitty name,
it was Jesse. But by the way, funny, funny thing, we we also have dustin here. Oh. You change
to cofounder. So you're now also a cofounder? Not just to CTO. That's good, but, Funny story.
So, that's it.
00:03:23:28 - 00:03:44:27
Jens
You're you're intro. How did you come up with the name of Cosmo? Because it's so funny when,
when when we created Cosmo, it was. It was more like. So we were on, on a retreat in
Netherlands, and we had to pivot. So that's like, a long time ago, I think more than two years.
Two and a half years, a bit more or maybe three years, I don't know.
00:03:44:27 - 00:04:10:25
Jens
We're so old now. And two weeks after the retreat, Dustin was like, hey, I have prepared
something. And by the way, it's called Cosmo. And this is so weird that you can talk about this
because at the very beginning I thought, that's a bit stupid. Like, who would call it Cosmo? Like
call it cosmos or something, but for whatever reason, like, Dustin said, it's Cosmo.
00:04:10:25 - 00:04:33:12
Jens
We we we kind of settled on Cosmo and, also funny anecdote. We have one investor.
Sometimes they they, they they help us. They like, we we meet with them and, and and they
spell it in the very they, they always say cosmos and we, we always lose it. It's, it's so weird, but.
Yeah, Dustin
00:04:33:18 - 00:04:41:15
Jens
Great to have you on the on the stream. How did you come up with the name of Cosmo?
00:04:41:18 - 00:05:02:02
Dustin
To be honest, I wouldn't. I wouldn't need to make up no story. But, it it's it's I don't know, it's, You
need to come up with a short name which which sounds appealing to people. You need to do
you need also a free domain, which is very important. But, it's I think it also needs to be a little
bit inspirational.
00:05:02:02 - 00:05:23:20
Dustin
And like, Cosmo is like, it's it's broad. It's it's it can mean anything. But it also does not limit you
in your imagination of what it can be. And it's Cosmo is is is big. It's it's unlimited. And, I think it
would be a great, great term of covering our goals and our, our ambitions.
00:05:23:22 - 00:05:48:25
Jens
Yeah, that that makes sense. Well said. It's also, for example, one of the reasons the company
is called WunderGraph is I, I, I kind of liked, the name of graph. I didn't want to have it GraphQL
and I, I don't know, somehow I wanted to have something German in it because WunderGraph,
it has German roots like Dustin and I and Bjorn.
00:05:48:25 - 00:06:23:21
Jens
We're from Germany with a sprinkle of Stefan from Miami and, yeah, it's, imagine your company
is called something GraphQL. And you kind of realize that you want to enter different markets.
Now. Now you have to tell people why, why why is my MCP server from something GraphQL
company? And I never wanted to have that kind of situation.
