## Ludwig's Reflections

Ludwig shares his experience working on Cosmo Connect:
- **Tight schedule**: Had a super tight schedule for the first version release
- **Team support**: Couldn't have done it alone - got massive support from Dustin, Jesse, and others
- **Design collaboration**: Others really helped with designing things
- **Enjoyment**: Makes him wake up excited about work - something many people don't have
- **Learning process**: Was a big learning experience, especially understanding the engine internals

## Jesse's Architectural Pride

Jesse highlights the planning and execution success:
- **Calendar diagram**: Shows a diagram from 5 months ago (before any code was written)
- **Architecture accuracy**: The final implementation matches the original diagram almost exactly
- **No rewrites**: Avoided "vibe coding" and constantly rewriting things
- **Production success**: Built a product that functionally works in production and solves the intended use case

## Dustin's Team-Focused Perspective

Dustin emphasizes the people aspect:
- **Right people**: Tech is not that important - you need the right people
- **Key qualities**: Curious, right attitude, hungry, and can work in a team
- **CTO role**: Tried to be part of the team, worked on protographic library
- **Rubber duck role**: Served as architect and sounding board
- **Team success**: The team did a fantastic job

## Jens on Company Culture

Jens reflects on the team and company:
- **Smart people**: Really cool, smart people at WunderGraph
- **Enjoyable work**: Very enjoyable to work together
- **Interesting problems**: Super interesting problems to solve
- **Time constraints**: Would love more time for actual hacking, but needs to do other things too

The team demonstrates strong collaboration, good architecture planning, and a focus on people over technology in building successful products.
