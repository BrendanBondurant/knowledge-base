I think that can be they can be many reasons, but I would say if you want to make a successful
career in tech and you're an engineer, I think the the, the engineers who make the most money,
those are people who understand the, the root of the problem. They understand the the
business behind the code. Not just the code, not just the tech.
00:15:43:19 - 00:16:11:13
Jens
They understand the customer. And I think they are getting closer and closer to the to the
customer. The you know, there's a distinction for me between someone who writes code and
someone who solves customer problems. It can be the same person solving customer
problems. It can mean to write code, but you're you shouldn't writing code or creating
architecture or building services.
00:16:11:13 - 00:16:36:15
Jens
It shouldn't be your one hammer and then you want to hammer it everywhere. You should be
more focus on okay, what what does the customer really need? How can we solve it and tech
tech is do you know in it's funny how I go from one to the next, but do you know in in when you
go to, to car design there's a, there's a saying like form follows function.
00:16:36:18 - 00:17:10:04
Jens
I know it's not what, what people like who who do art and stuff, but sometimes it's, it's just easier
to to think about the, the problem and then you derive the solution and you're on and going like,
oh, we're building a new thing. Let's create microservices. What what problem are we solving.
Are you really focusing on the problem or or are you prematurely scaling because you're like,
yeah.

You had a couple good points there. And last week, somebody posted on, Hacker News. They
posted a screenshot of when they announced cursor, and the top comment was a developer
saying, I don't understand why this is x, y, z, I just did this is just a fork of VS code. This is VC
bs, oh no, it wasn't cursor.
00:17:30:15 - 00:17:56:15
Stefan
It was, Windsurf. And then somebody posted it on Twitter and was like windsurf acquired for $3
billion and I posted a comment which was like, I've noticed that developers get obsessed with
the technology and not actually solving about the problem, which is true because they focus
more on the technical implementations. Like, sure, windsurf is more or less not a super
impressive piece of technology, but what it did is it solve the problem, and it solved it pretty well,
and I solved it pretty quick.
00:17:56:18 - 00:18:14:27
Stefan
And I think you're spot on. And if you remember the Dropbox example, do you remember when
he announced Dropbox and developers started ripping into it? They were like, oh, this is this,
this isn't bad. Like, that's not super impressive because they were just talking about the tech,
but they were not solving what the problem is that now you can transfer files into the cloud with
the click of a button.
00:18:15:00 - 00:18:40:13
Stefan
And I think what you said is the nail on the head. It's resumé driven development. They want to
say that I've built this with Kubernetes. I've added microservices and things like that, I don't
know. For me it's cool. I've always seen coding as just a tool. It's a means to an end. Coding
isn't anything else but a tool that helps you solve a problem in terms of programming and
architecture and software, all it is is solving your problem.
00:18:40:13 - 00:18:56:14
Stefan
But you should be obsessed with the problem, not how you get there or the tools that you use.
You know, like carpenters. I mean, you were a carpenter, which is a great example. You liked
building things, but you weren't obsessed with your hammer. You know, you didn't be like
hammer for everything, hammer for everything. And it's like, no, we need to.
00:18:56:17 - 00:19:14:05
Stefan
We need to build the drywall. No hammer. I'm going to use my hammer. And that's the way I see
developers that are obsessed with, you know, like microservice architecture. It's like, oh, I have
this new hammer, it's golden, and it has a different claw or a sledgehammer, and it's going to
solve my problem. And it's like, you. And what did I agree to that?
00:19:14:06 - 00:19:16:25
Stefan
What do you think?
00:19:16:27 - 00:19:56:21
Jens
Yeah. Like you can be super obsessed about how you build dry walls. And you can you can
have your, like your craziest set up and tooling and whatnot to, to do dry walls. And then the, the
customer, they will take the drywall. They will they will paint it whatever. They will not care about
your drywall. They, they just want a drywall and yeah, this is this is another interesting point
because, another observation I made about myself, but also other developers.
00:19:56:21 - 00:20:22:04
Jens
And, by the way, I'm, I'm not ranting about developers. I also have a lot of empathy for for
resumé driven development because, as a developer, you always have this this. I don't know if
you had this, you were a developer also for a time, but I always felt a little bit like an imposter.
You know, I, I always felt like, I don't know, there's people they know so much more like, I need
to learn faster.
