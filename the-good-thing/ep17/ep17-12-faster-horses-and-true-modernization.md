summary: Stefan concludes with Henry Ford's famous quote about customers wanting faster
  horses instead of cars, drawing a parallel to how companies ask for faster developers
  when they actually need true modernization through Cosmo's collaboration platform.
  He emphasizes that customers don't realize they want comprehensive modernization—they
  just know they want to move faster and break less, similar to wanting faster horses
  rather than revolutionary transportation.

Stefan
I'm going to close with the comment that I was one of my favorite is from Henry Ford, where
they said if I would have asked them what they would have wanted, they would have said faster
horses. And if you ask companies what they want, they're saying, we want our developers to be
faster. They want this and that. What they actually want is the car, which is Cosmo.

Stefan
The collaboration and everything is we're modernizing everything. They don't actually know
that's what they want. What they see is I just want to move faster and break less, and I want to
modernize my stack. But they're just saying I want faster horses. I think that example is spot on.
I'm excited for what we're building, guys. Let us know below which format that you like better.

If you like recorded videos, let us know. We prefer live because it's a little bit more fun for us, but
the good thing is, oh wait, I actually messed that up. Yeah, yeah. Jens what is the good thing?
00:56:50:29 - 00:56:55:23
Jens
The good thing is we're we're we're back live next week. Right?
00:56:55:25 - 00:57:02:07
Stefan
Yeah. We're back live next week. Thanks, guys. I'll see you guys on another episode of The
Good Thing. Thanks again Jens. Great episode.

See you.
