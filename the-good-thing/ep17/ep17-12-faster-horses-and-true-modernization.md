I'm going to close with the comment that I was one of my favorite is from Henry Ford, where
they said if I would have asked them what they would have wanted, they would have said faster
horses. And if you ask companies what they want, they're saying, we want our developers to be
faster. They want this and that. What they actually want is the car, which is Cosmo.

The collaboration and everything is we're modernizing everything. They don't actually know
that's what they want. What they see is I just want to move faster and break less, and I want to
modernize my stack. But they're just saying I want faster horses. I think that example is spot on.
I'm excited for what we're building, guys. Let us know below which format that you like better.

Good Thing. Thanks again Jens. Great episode.
