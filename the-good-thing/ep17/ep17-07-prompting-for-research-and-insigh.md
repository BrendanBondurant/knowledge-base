summary: |
  Jens describes using ChatGPT's Deep Research mode to gather insights for RFC development, investing time in careful prompting to get well-researched analysis rather than using AI to write code directly. He emphasizes that developers should reimagine their role as problem solvers rather than code writers, comparing the careful prompting process to having a conversation with a senior developer who has reviewed multiple documents.

Jens
I added a bunch of, of, requirements for my RFC. And I didn't intend to use AI to write the RFC. I
just wanted the AI to do the research and to give me ideas. So I go to chatGPT and I go to the
deep research mode. I give it the links, some prompts. So I and I actually invested like ten
minutes into really articulating what I'm looking for.
00:30:57:28 - 00:31:43:24
Jens
And then I make a coffee or something and five, ten minutes later I get a well researched paper.
I can, I can review it, and I'm not even considering using that for my RFC. It's more like, okay,
now I have this in my brain, this this dump. I and I will sleep over it. And now I have some some
fresh ideas, and it's as if I had a conversation with a senior developer who read all our all these
seven documents, and they gave me some thoughts and now I can I'm one step further and if
you're not using these kind of tools, if you're not trying out how Cursor could help you.
00:31:43:24 - 00:32:15:19
Jens
And I'm not saying like, you know, LLMs generate tokens, okay? Like it's not intelligence. It's not
smart in any way. But, I think we as developers, we have to to reimagine our job because we're
not code writers. We are problem solvers. And for me, describing a prompt and working with
ChatGPT Deep Research to figure out how to solve a problem for me that is engineering.
00:32:15:21 - 00:32:50:12
Jens
So my job hasn't really hasn't really changed. It's it's just I'm now doing it at another level. And
I'm honest with you, in the beginning, it's kind of fun to write code and to see how it compiles
and runs. But after several years, I'm I'm still very interested in solving problems, but I'm I'm not
going crazy about typing words to make it like it's not so important for me to type every single
character, if you know what I mean.
00:32:50:14 - 00:33:11:00
Stefan
I think you're spot on, and I really like that example. And one of the things I'm noticing is like, do
you remember, like when Amazon was being built or just the internet and people were like, oh,
the internet's just a fad, and it's just something that's going to go away. And what I'm sometimes
hearing, which is crazy from people, is like, oh, AI this just bubble, it's going to burst.
00:33:11:00 - 00:33:30:27
Stefan
It's not really that useful or whatever. And the thing is, is, Shopify and now Duolingo and I'm
telling you, all these other public company CEOs are going to start doing the exact same thing,
which is the API or like the API mandate, but the AI mandate you have to incorporate or at least
be using AI into your tooling because it's what you said.
00:33:30:27 - 00:33:56:01
Stefan
It's just a tool, but it's an extremely powerful tool. And I do think it's a red flag as a technologist,
not to use AI, because as a technologist and a problem solver, your goal is to use the best and
most available tools at your disposal to solve that problem. And it's what you said. Like you
could have spent ten hours, 15 hours doing deep research, reading all those things and
everything, but instead you prompted it.
00:33:56:02 - 00:34:19:27
Stefan
You spent ten minutes describing exactly what you want. You press enter, and you went. While it
was compiling and building and getting all that information. You went and you made yourself a
coffee, and you might not be at step ten where you're finished, but you're at step five, and you
did that in ten minutes. And I think AI it's such a powerful tool for that, that when we hear in the
interviews like, oh, I used AI, it actually makes me happy because it's like, okay, you're using
tools at your disposal.
00:34:20:00 - 00:34:44:14
Stefan
And one example I'll draw back to is when I was doing my computer science degree. Every
exam was, open book and open computer, for this one teacher. And this teacher said, this is
what he said. He's like, I don't understand professors that don't let you use your computer or
your book. Because in the real world, when you're an engineer, you're going to have Google
open, you're going to have everything open.
00:34:44:14 - 00:34:58:01
Stefan
So that way you can solve all these problems and you should use every tool at your disposal.
So it doesn't make sense for me to create this environment in this classroom where that's not
the truth, but it's going to be hard problems, and you're going to have to be able to use the
internet. But I agree with you 100%.
