summary: Jens discusses how development has become exponentially more complex compared
  to simple PHP/Apache setups, while the majority of developers now have less than
  3 years of experience. He expresses concern about junior developers using AI tools
  like Cursor to "vibe code" without understanding fundamentals, comparing it unfavorably
  to traditional apprenticeship models where you learn to do things by hand first.

Jens
I need to to understand more. I so I think imposter syndrome, it's a, it's a real thing as a, as a
developer and yeah, you can, you can really have anxiety that you're not able to catch up or
something. So, I think, yeah, there is something to, to just trying out new, new things and stuff.
But I would also say it's, it's a thing of experience and one observation is that over the last
couple of years, I feel like on, on one hand, software development became increasingly more
complex, like the tools we have today.
00:21:06:04 - 00:21:34:22
Jens
They're just so much more complex than what you had in the past. You know, when I learned
programing, you would have a PHP file and Apache server or Engine X, and you would upload
your PHP file with FTP, and then you have a website. And that was okay. That, that, that was it,
that and, and maybe had you had a MySQL database.
00:21:34:24 - 00:22:04:24
Jens
And today look at our stack frontend, we have Next.js. Then we have keycloak for federated
authentication. In the backend we have Node.js. For the database we have Postgres for
caching. We have Redis for analytics we have clickhouse. Then we have opentelemetry for
telemetry and tracing and metrics and like holy shit it's it's it's so complex. This is one part.
00:22:04:26 - 00:22:37:18
Jens
So you have a lot to learn to understand this modern stack. And then the second part is, last
couple of years, like last ten years, there was like a huge influx of new developers. There's huge
demand for for developers. And what this results in is that if you have demand for developers
and on such a steep trajectory, what it means is that the majority of developers, they actually
have like below 2 or 3 years of experience.
00:22:37:21 - 00:23:08:21
Jens
So I think we are now at a at a time where, where the majority of developers, they are not
seniors. And so combining these two, a lot of not seniors, a lot of junior or mid-level people with
not so much experience, then you have this ever increasing complexity of of the stack of the
web, and now you combine it with AI and whatnot and vibe coding.
00:23:08:21 - 00:23:47:02
Jens
And now everybody has anxiety and what is what is next. And, you know, you now have this
new generation of, of of junior deaths. You give them cursor, they vibe code something together.
They don't even see that it's broken or that there are security vulnerabilities. They have never
done it by hand. And this is something, you know, I, I think it's it's it's something good about
when you do an apprenticeship as a, as a carpenter, you know, we, we have machines to, to do
carpentry.
00:23:47:04 - 00:24:06:09
Jens
And you can automate many of the steps, and there's like super cool tooling. But if you do an
apprenticeship, the first thing you do is you, you do these kind of things by hand. And it takes a
lot of time. And when you mess it up, you have to do it again. And you yeah, you really learn the,
the details.
00:24:06:09 - 00:24:13:27
Jens
And that might be something in software development that we're, that we're lacking a little bit.
00:24:14:00 - 00:24:33:12
Stefan
I want to add to that. Like if you remember pre-COVID like engineering was up and coming like
not up and coming, but like we were hiring like crazy. And then COVID hit and the number of
engineers being hired was like crazy. Companies like zoom, Cammy, all these companies
exploded hiring engineers. And one unique thing came out of it, which was bootcamps.
00:24:33:15 - 00:24:54:13
Stefan
These bootcamps were exploding people. Everybody was becoming a developer because as
soon as you graduate, you get a job for 200 K somewhere in the Bay area. And it was insane.
And there was basically like this gold rush of developers. And the point that I'm getting at is if
you look now, bootcamps are dying, and the reason that they were dying is because they were
just like a mill.
00:24:54:13 - 00:25:14:25
Stefan
They were taking in developers give them flask and a little bit of a database and some
experience, and then they would send them out into the world. And it's what you said they were
very junior developers, and the reason that they're dying now is because if you give a person
with a little bit of technical knowledge cursor, you're getting the same output that you get from
one of these bootcamps.
