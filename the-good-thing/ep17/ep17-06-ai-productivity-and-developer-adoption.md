summary: |
  Stefan explores the debate between AI making developers 10x more productive versus replacing them entirely, comparing technology's constant evolution to more stable fields like medicine. He notes that developers must constantly relearn everything as technology cycles refresh every 17 years, from simple FTP uploads in the 90s to AI-assisted cloud deployment today, questioning whether this makes developers stronger or more dependent on tools.

Stefan
You're getting a very junior engineer that has a lot to learn. And what the bootcamps did really
wrong is they didnt actually give world like real life experience, oh build this to do app with this
database. Okay. Boom, there you go. And you can do the exact same thing with cursor. And so
it's kind of interesting. And we were talking about this today as well is which I like.
00:25:36:14 - 00:25:58:11
Stefan
People are on one side of the fence is that AI is going to make developers 10x faster and better.
Or the other side of the fence is that we're going to replace developers with AI. And I think that's
super interesting, and I don't understand which side of the fence I'm on. Obviously, I'm on the
side of the fence that it's going to make developers stronger and faster and better because
you're always going to need good people, good technologists.
00:25:58:11 - 00:26:23:08
Stefan
It's like what you said is imposter syndrome is a very real thing with developers because
engineering is one of the only careers where you have to constantly relearn everything, like for
example, doctors, they go, they finish medical school, and then they have continuing education
every two years where they go and they just get up to update practices. And the thing about the
medical field is a lot of the stuff doesn't change for ten, 15, 20 years or it never changes.
00:26:23:08 - 00:26:46:18
Stefan
Like you're still doing stitches the same way that they were doing them in the 70s. And that's
totally fine with technology. If you were a developer in 1997 and now your world has completely
changed completely changed. Like, and what's cool about technology? Somebody wrote this, I
forgot what book. But every 17 years, technology, like everything that you know about
technology, is completely wiped away.
00:26:46:18 - 00:27:06:07
Stefan
Like back down to what you said, you know, you had FTP, you could write a file and boom, that's
a website. Back in the 90s, if you knew how to run servers and machines, you were an anomaly.
You could build things. Now you don't even need to understand how the cloud works. You could
just tell ChatGPT, hey, help me connect this with AWS and boom, you have something running
on the cloud.
00:27:06:07 - 00:27:22:08
Stefan
And I think you're absolutely right. But with this transition, what do you think about that fence
with AI being introduced and cursor and all these tools? What do you think is going to happen to
developers? Are they going to get stronger or are they going to get worse? Or are they going to
become obsolete?
00:27:22:10 - 00:28:02:07
Jens
Yeah, that that's a great question. I mean, I'm, I'm biased. I'm, I'm a developer myself. But I
would say maybe maybe I'm naive, but. So you have two options. You replace developers with
AI. So that means you can achieve the same goal but with less resources. So your your more
efficient. But the the outcome is still the same or you have the same resources and you, you
accelerate your you increase your outcome.
00:28:02:10 - 00:28:59:08
Jens
So I would say if you can increase your outcome with AI, it means you can release faster, you
can release better, you can release more. So that means you will learn faster. You will get more
experience into the market faster. So ultimately I think that will compound. And people who
replace developers with AI, I think they will slow down because the, the they, they kind of have
like a flat going function or a function that goes slightly down, even though they are more
efficient, but they are on the, on the, on the dying slope versus I think the, the companies who
will who will, who will keep their, the developers give them.
00:28:59:08 - 00:29:14:04
Jens
AI or keep the right developers who understand AI, I think they will be more like on the
exponential function. So you know, there was this old saying like software is eating the world
and I'm wondering company
00:29:14:04 - 00:29:14:28
Stefan
Right?
00:29:15:00 - 00:29:56:16
Jens
Yes. Companies with the right mindset, with the right engineers, with with AI, I think they can
accelerate even more and by the way, I, I kind of have developed an opinion that when we now
interview people, I ask them how they think about AI and if they are against using AI on the job. I
see it as a red flag because I think, like nobody should be vie coding or just like, I don't know,
like use AI to do random stuff.
00:29:56:16 - 00:30:28:18
Jens
But I can give you an example how how I used AI today. So I wanted to write an RFC for a new
feature, and I knew based on my domain knowledge, there are like seven links that point to our
GitHub repository, to our docs, to some other documents, to our, to, to some code examples.
And so I compiled a list of, of, links to research.
