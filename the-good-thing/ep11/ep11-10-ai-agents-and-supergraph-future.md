Jens
It's not a big deal with something like persistent operations or something. So it's it's not so hard.
And then we cover the main use cases for our apps. We can have queries. So the query
interface and then we need to bring in more data onto the super graph. And, and I think this is
where, where things get super, super interesting.
00:53:26:20 - 00:53:32:00
Jens
And yeah, I think that's that's our focus.
00:53:32:03 - 00:53:41:02
Stefan
You said every company though, do you think every company should use GraphQL and then
follow up. Do you think every company should use GraphQL Federation.
00:53:41:04 - 00:53:44:24
Jens
00:53:45:18 - 00:54:14:01
Jens
I, I don't know if I would build just a GraphQL server today. Yeah, I, I think, I don't know, maybe
maybe not a startup, but, I think if I, if I, if I would build a startup, I would just build an like RPC
or whatever, like super simple. If you are a larger organization, I would think about how can I
have a supergraph just because I think it's a it's a superior pattern.
00:54:14:01 - 00:54:51:00
Jens
Bring all bring all data together, unified. It's so powerful. And it allows us allows you to do so
many, so many powerful things. And and also just, if you can have one unified approach, how
everybody discusses schema like what are the entities in our in our domain. Like for example, I
many years ago I worked with a carmaker in Germany and they had REST APIs and they had, I
don't know, seven or more definitions of what a car is.
00:54:51:00 - 00:55:01:12
Jens
And yeah, that's not really useful. Ideally we can we can have one car definition and we can all
agree on on what the fields should be, etc.. So yeah.
00:55:01:15 - 00:55:20:15
Stefan
It's well said. And it's one of the cool benefits is like our customer roadmap is that sometimes we
tell companies, you know, maybe federation isn't for you. And I think that's really important that a
vendor tells you federation is useful for you, not versus just, hey, this is the ideal solution. It is an
ideal solution for a lot of companies.
00:55:20:17 - 00:55:38:13
Stefan
But for some companies it doesn't make sense. But I think that's well said. And then let's talk a
little bit because we only have five minutes left. I want to talk a little bit about, you know, we got
the, the fundraising is it's exciting, but what kind of key roles are we hiring for for this next
iteration?
00:55:38:13 - 00:55:54:20
Stefan
I think it's really important to understand, especially on the engineering part, what these
engineers will be working on, because there's a lot of cool tech that we're working with. There's
a lot of cool companies that we're working with. But what would people on the engineering team
be working on if they were to join wundergraph?
00:55:54:22 - 00:56:24:05
Jens
Yeah. So you you can build the the foundation of API infrastructure for, for the fortune 500
essentially. I believe everybody will standardize on, on the, on the super graph pattern. And
yeah, like you can be at the forefront of, of helping us, define, how that will, look like in detail. So
that's one part.
00:56:24:08 - 00:56:51:23
Jens
And then if you look inside, we have pretty interesting topics like, you know, you can work a lot
with, with data structures, with AST transformations transform between protocols. You, you learn
a lot about high performance and networking. All this kind of stuff. So I think it's super
interesting. It's a super interesting topic. It's very challenging, to get it right.
00:56:51:23 - 00:57:35:05
Jens
And enterprise integration, like, telemetry, observability, all these kind of things. And then. Yeah,
like things like, graph theory, understanding how, how queries look like, how they plan,
analyzing queries and, and yeah. On the, on the, on the impact side, I think we can really build
tooling to help organizations collaborate better. I think every, every digital business, it relies on
APIs, be it developers who use SDK s or AI using MCP, but below both or underneath both, you
have APIs.
00:57:35:06 - 00:58:10:25
Jens
So, it's very likely you have like a super graph pattern and, and yeah, we can build the, the
architecture for that. And then you can also build if you're, you know, if you go dev, you can work
on, on router engine, things like that. So the API gateway and the GraphQL engine and then if
you're more like, like a full stack dev or front end dev, then we, we are building tools for, for
collaboration, for observability, analytics, like user interfaces that, that help people work together
and, and work on schema and, and all these kind of things.
00:58:10:25 - 00:58:37:01
Jens
So, yeah, I think super interesting challenges. It's not your regular. Oh. I build a backend, I build
a front end. It's it's more like, okay, this is a very novel space. Like, nobody has been here.
There's there's little research. You can rely on this little. Yeah. Little, cursor can do. Like,
sometimes you just have to figure it out yourself and uh, so, yeah, I think, what challenges?
00:58:37:01 - 00:59:00:28
Stefan
We have a lot of them. we’re hiring all across. And then one thing is, the founder of Khan, he
said this, in one of his funding announcements, is that with AI and this what we’ll end on and, so
I would love your thoughts on this. Is. Yeah. You're familiar with the assembly line, right? Like
how they Henry Ford, they would make the cars, you know, it would go down the assembly line
and there'd be a single person, and they would just do that single job.
00:59:00:28 - 00:59:20:07
Stefan
And then before you know it, the car is built by the end of it. And he said, what the internet is, is
people building all these services, but it's going across an assembly line. So a company is like
General Motors and they're building these cars. These cars are their products. And as it goes
down the assembly line, APIs are the parts.
00:59:20:09 - 00:59:40:16
Stefan
The screw this thing here, that thing there, what the person is connecting to that. Would you
agree with that statement? I really like it as an analogy for how APIs work, but where does AI fit
into that? Like how does AI improve building APIs better and faster?
00:59:40:18 - 01:00:12:14
Jens
I'm not sure how does API help building APIs faster? I'm not sure on that, but what what I think
is going to happen at least I or that's my prediction. I'm not sure if it's too early to predict, but if
we can build a super graph and we have MCP and now, tools like cursor, ChatGPT, etc., they
can hook into super graph.
01:00:12:17 - 01:00:26:26
Jens
Yes. I'm, I'm just wondering like I think this this will unlock like a new internet because I think
very soon Web3 we will have.
01:00:26:29 - 01:00:34:19
Stefan
Do you remember Web3? All the crypto bros saying there's a new internet with the blockchain?
Is that what you're referring to, a new internet?
01:00:34:22 - 01:00:40:19
Jens
No, but. So.
01:00:40:22 - 01:01:22:13
Jens
You know, I think companies like, like anthropic and others, I think they are very close to building
agents who can autonomously, do tasks. Yeah. And I think super graph, the super graph pattern
is a perfect foundation to enable MCP to talk to anything in your company. I don't think you want
to build MCP as a translation layer to everything, but if MCP is just a thin layer that speaks
GraphQL, then the super graph becomes an essential part.
01:01:22:16 - 01:01:48:13
Jens
So I think very soon we will have, commodity tools with agents so I can open something like
Excel or like Excel like, like a, like a business user app. And it has agent capabilities. And now I
can give it MCP access. And then I think it can do anything. It can pull data out of our database
like customer records, like anything.
01:01:48:13 - 01:02:15:03
Jens
It can be so powerful. And then I'm just wondering where where like where is this going? It can
accelerate like quite rapidly that that new applications evolve that, that now are built on top of
these layers. And then yeah, I think we're, we're kind of in the, in the, in the shuffle business
because, you know, we're, we're the with the boring pipes and the data needs to come from,
from somewhere.
