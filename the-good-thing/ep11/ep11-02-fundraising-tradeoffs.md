00:06:00:22 - 00:06:32:20
Jens
It was clear that this year has a lot of opportunities we wouldn't be able to take without
additional funding because we yeah, we we couldn't go as fast as we want. And yeah, like if you
if you want to handle enterprise customers right. You have to have certain certain things in
place. And yeah. So, I don't think it was like such a tough decision to make it.
00:06:32:25 - 00:06:59:13
Jens
It was more like, yeah, I think it's it's the right time. And then eBay came along. EBay is is pretty
cool because, I wrote about this in the blog post in our announcement and they, they help us a
lot. Like if you are a startup and you're building something for enterprise, it is worth a lot.
00:06:59:13 - 00:07:27:21
Jens
If you can have a design partner who who helps you understand how enterprise works, what
kind of integration points you need? For, for metrics and other things. And, so, yeah, it's, it's, I
think it's a very helpful thing. And then also the brand, in terms of, what it means, if you can put
on your landing page that, that such a big companies, is not just a customer but also an
investor.
00:07:27:21 - 00:07:49:17
Jens
I think that that also means something. Yeah. So and I think in general, it, it, it has a meaning
that a public company is betting on us. It speaks for the relationship we have built with the
people. I don't know, what else would you add?
00:07:49:19 - 00:08:08:02
Stefan
There's a lot that you said there. I mean, there's a lot to unpack. David saying that we were late.
Yes, this is true. We were a little bit late, but sorry about that. But, I mean, there's a lot to unpack
with funding like, I totally agree with you. Like, you should really when you're building a
company, you should really understand why you want to take funding.
00:08:08:08 - 00:08:22:12
Stefan
Do you want to move faster? Do you want to build a lifestyle business? Do you want to IPO
eventually? Like what is your goal as a founder? And I think a lot of founders skip that and they
go, oh, I need to raise money. But like, why do you need to raise money? Like, why do you need
to do this?
00:08:22:12 - 00:08:41:02
Stefan
Why do you want to dilute your shares? There's great companies out there that do great in
revenue. And it's a sole owner. He he owns 100% of the company. He bootstrapped it from the
beginning. It might have taken him longer. And also it's important to understand investors. So
investors want to give you money because they want to see a return in about ten years.
00:08:41:04 - 00:08:56:26
Stefan
And theres is it's go really fast or hit the ground and burn and then go to the next one. And a lot
of people understand is that investors really just care about the power law, is that one company
in their portfolio will return the whole fund. Their goal is just to find that one company. Other
funds are different.
00:08:56:26 - 00:09:14:05
Stefan
There are some funds that really don't care about that, and they make strategic bets and they
act more like like I would say, like, I don't know, like, strategic bank, you know, they're making
good bets. Small acquisition here. So I think it definitely as a founder, you you want to
understand why you want to take funding. And then I talk about this a lot with my friends.
00:09:14:05 - 00:09:46:06
Stefan
They're like, oh, like funding must be amazing. It must be amazing. And it's like, it's cool. But
again, it's just a tool, like you're just using the money and it also adds a lot of headache on it. If
you remember the guy, Park Conrad, he's the founder of rippling. He says fundraising is actually
the easiest part about building a company, because you go and you do these pitches and it's
annoying and people complain like, oh my God, I've pitched a thousand times, or I've pitched
5000 times, but if you go and you build a real company, that's actually the easiest part, because
the hardest part is once you get the money is like, oh
00:09:46:06 - 00:10:00:14
Stefan
shit. So now I have to execute. And Jens, I want to talk a little bit about this. Like, I mean, we
were we were pretty frustrated when we were raising for the series A, not because we weren't
getting traction, but because we just wanted to go back and work with the customers and focus
on the stuff that matters.
00:10:00:21 - 00:10:17:24
Stefan
Like, this is important, yes, but what are your thoughts on that? Do you remember, like in
December when we we had to go to we went to Tallinn. We got to meet our amazing lead
investors, karma. And then we went to London in five days. We went to six countries, I think,
and we were just exploring and just talking to VCs and that whole time we could have been with
customers.
00:10:17:24 - 00:10:29:21
Stefan
But like talk to me a little bit about that. Like the balance of going and having to raise money and
putting on your fundraising hat and then also having to delegate, you know, like your customers
and things like that.
00:10:29:23 - 00:10:48:05
Jens
I mean, ideally you don't have to raise, and I think you can also very much lose yourself in, in
the fundraising game. And also you can you can. Are you laughing.
00:10:48:08 - 00:10:49:17
Stefan
No, no,just my chair.
00:10:49:19 - 00:11:22:00
Jens
Just a chair okay. You know, the the thing is, you can try to find validation in what VCs say, and
this can be extremely dangerous. VCs are not your customers. And, yeah, I don't know, but it's
super weird. But when we raised our series seed, I was I was super interested or I was really
trying to to get VCs to buy into what we're doing and to.
00:11:22:02 - 00:11:47:05
Jens
Yeah, to impress them and to be like, hey, we're we're innovative, blah, blah, blah. And at series
a. I don't know, I think really what, what matters is what what what kind of customer stories you
have. How what have you learned from customers? What do you see in the market. And you
you don't need confirmation from, from VCs.
00:11:47:07 - 00:12:13:29
Jens
So and by the way, one, one comment you made on, on VCs making, like, returning the fund,
there's different VCs. So some VCs want to return the fund, others have other models. So, and
this is also a thing fundraising is selling. You're you're you're selling a ticket on your ship. And,
this, this ship should find gold.
