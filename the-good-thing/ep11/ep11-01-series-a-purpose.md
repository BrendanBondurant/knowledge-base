Episode 11
00:00:24:18 - 00:00:53:18
Stefan
And we're live. Welcome back, everybody, to another episode of the Good Thing podcast,
hosted by me, Stefan, and joined by my co-host Jens. Excuse me for a little bit. I'm a little bit
tired because yesterday was a huge day for us at wundergraph . So you might have seen the
news, but we finally announced our series A funding, which was led by Karma Ventures and
then with a strategic follow on from eBay ventures and then our existing investors continuing
their investment in us with AspenWood Ventures.
00:00:53:18 - 00:01:09:09
Stefan
But amazing news, we're super excited about that. Today we're going to talk about why we took
the funding, building the future of API collaboration, and everything that it means to us. But
before that, I told you that I would do this a little bit of a celebration on our end.
00:01:10:21 - 00:01:24:12
Stefan
So good. If you guys watch some old episodes that we used to post from like, WunderGraph
Show and Tell, we used to use that horn a lot, which was awesome. But, yeah, Jens. I mean,
welcome back. It's it's kind of weird now because we did it in person last week, which was a bit
more fun in my opinion.
00:01:24:14 - 00:01:29:26
Stefan
But yeah. Any thoughts on the series A, Anything you want to tell the crowd?
00:01:29:29 - 00:01:35:10
Jens
It's funny you say it was exhausting because what did you do yesterday?
00:01:35:12 - 00:01:49:23
Stefan
It was exhausting. I had to reply to everyone's LinkedIn message. Thank you, thank you. You
know, old friends were coming into my Instagram like, hey, how are you? Good to see you and
things like that. So very tiring.
00:01:49:25 - 00:02:35:06
Jens
Yeah. No, I mean, I don't know from, from my perspective, it's it's much less about the, raising
the money and much more about what it actually means to raise the money. All the work that
went into this, before, so that that was, I would say a huge undertaking. And it's also super
weird. And I'm actually happy that we that we now have this out because, yeah, for a very long
time, we couldn't talk about it, and we, we couldn't talk about, that, that we were able to to,
00:02:35:09 - 00:03:01:07
Jens
Yeah. Turn the ship around and we, we couldn't talk about, the ups and downs and everything,
and, it's also, you know, I, I would love to be more transparent as a founder, but how transparent
can you be about struggling after a seed round and things not working out? And, yeah, you want
you want to to show confidence.
00:03:01:07 - 00:03:20:27
Jens
You want to be able to to tell people like, hey, it's it's working you you can rely on on what we're
doing. And, yeah, I think last year was was very hard, especially in the beginning. And then we
started turning it around and, yeah. Now, now we're here.
00:03:21:00 - 00:03:49:04
Stefan
Yeah. Well, so and I think an important thing is that people see funding rounds and it's like, wow,
amazing. And I don't see them that way. I actually see them as completely differently. And, Gary
Tan from, Y Combinator, like, I think he's the president CEO now. He says when you get a new
funding round, you don't pop champagne, you pour yourself a little glass of wine, and then you
get right back into it the next day, only on exits, or if you get acquired or if you IPO, that's when
you really pop the champagne.
00:03:49:04 - 00:04:04:18
Stefan
And so I fully agree with you. Like the money is cool, the press is cool. But what it really means
is, hey, now we can accelerate our mission. And that's what matters. And what we always talk
about. Our customers. How how can we use this money to benefit our customers more? What
do you think about that?
00:04:04:21 - 00:04:37:14
Jens
You said the money is cool. I don't think the money is cool. I think the money is money. And it's
not even our money. Okay? It's now in the company, so it's a tool. Okay, so the company has
customers and it has revenue and it has products. And with the money, we can we can
essentially build more product faster than we could do if we bootstrapped.
00:04:37:16 - 00:05:02:24
Jens
Which also leads a bit to the question of why are you even. You know, it was funny, like we did
this announcement video of, and you mentioned like, hey, why why are we diluting our shares?
Because, yeah, that's that's true. You know, every, every funding announcement, it should
actually be like, hey, we have diluted our shares. yipee
00:05:03:00 - 00:05:28:00
Jens
What's what's so cool about that. And from I think from a founder perspective, if you want to
take funding, you have to ask yourself the question, is it worth diluting? What do I get for it? And
for example, in our situation, I think with the current market climate, there's so much going on.
00:05:28:00 - 00:06:00:22
Jens
There's AI, there's federation, there's, you know, other players with with, huge market shares.
There's innovation that could happen theres, investments we could make. But if we do all of this
in a bootstrapped way, we we can we we have to operate at a different pace. And I think from
our perspective, I can I can speak for, for all founders.
