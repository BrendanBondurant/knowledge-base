Jens
And, yeah, I think it's, it's a good spot to be in because, yeah, I think agents, they will they will
really accelerate stuff. And they need data. We do that. So yeah.
01:02:27:20 - 01:02:44:00
Stefan
I'm excited because it's a good spot to and and so we'll end on that because we have actually a
retro after this. And Dustin will be mad if we're late. But end of the episode, we're really excited
about the fundraising round. We're hiring across all fronts. Come help us build the essential
plumbing for basically every company out there.

Stefan
There's a lot of interesting problems you can work on here. You've seen our Conway's Law. It's
two teams, mostly just one big team and one small team working on the the query planning in
the engine. But it's fascinating stuff that they're really doing. We're hiring on all fronts. So keep a
lookout on the website. And Jens, what's the good thing.

great weekend. Bye.
