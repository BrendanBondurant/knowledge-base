Jens
And, now you need to tell people why your ship is good. Like, how will it find gold and stuff like
that? And, so it's very much like selling. But the problem is you want to sell your product, and
that's actually a different product than selling a ticket on your ship. So it's, it's a huge distraction
because, you also have to sell differently.
00:12:39:27 - 00:13:04:26
Jens
Like, you know, your customers, they care about your features. VCs care about the features of
your ship. So why is your ship a good ship? Why? Why sail with you? Why not another ship? Is
your ship diesel engine? Is it, is it whatever electric. And how will it succeeded in very bad
waves and all this kind of stuff like.
00:13:04:29 - 00:13:30:00
Jens
And. Yeah. So I don't know fundraising this into I, you, you know, me, I very much like sales and
I like to understand what, what people want and I think, you know, you mentioned there's people
who have like hundreds of VC calls and stuff. I think you don't need hundreds of VC calls. What
you actually need is just like sales.
00:13:30:02 - 00:13:56:07
Jens
You need the process to vet VCs because it's like it's a it's about leads. So you should have a
lot of leads. You should have a good phone book, and you should figure out who understands
what you're doing because, you know, let's say you you build a ship and you want to sail it to
America, and you talk to people who don't understand America, and they don't want to go there.
00:13:56:10 - 00:14:19:19
Jens
You can tell them, hey, my ship is fast, but they don't want to go to America. Well, they don't
understand what you're trying to do. And so ideally, you can build a network of VCs around you
who are already aligned with with your direction. And so a lot of fundraising, it actually starts
months and years before raising like at seed stage.
00:14:19:19 - 00:14:40:15
Jens
For example. You have an idea, and then you, you do something and they, they don't give you
money, but they observe and then you, you keep them updated on your progress. You pivot,
okay. You tell them about it. And this is also an important thing. Like, there's nothing wrong with
pivoting like nobody cares if you pivot.
00:14:40:15 - 00:14:59:06
Jens
What people care about is, are you are you are you finding a way to gold. And so if you go the
wrong way and then you change course and you find something, then then tell that story
because it means, okay, now they have experienced, they have learned something. Okay. It's,
it's it's better to, to bet on them.
00:14:59:06 - 00:15:14:04
Jens
So. Yeah, that's that's a lot of nuance in fundraising. It's it's a fun game. But it's also a distraction
from building product and talking to customers, working with customers. So. Okay. Typical long
monologue.
00:15:14:06 - 00:15:16:09
Stefan
But it's well said though. I kinda like it.
00:15:16:10 - 00:15:19:20
Jens
Take your pick your part and rip it apart.
00:15:19:23 - 00:15:40:14
Stefan
Yeah. No, I mean I think it's important and like, especially for you like, I mean you didn't have
experience. I mean, none of us had experience with pitching to VCs, especially coming from a
pure technical background. But what I've learned about venture capital is, it's like so seed stage
is you're betting on the team, you're really just betting on the team.
00:15:40:16 - 00:15:57:28
Stefan
The product might be amazing, but especially if they're first time founders, you're betting and
saying, hey, can this group of guys or girls or whatever this group is, can they execute and build
this into $1 billion company series a though is a little bit different series a is a little bit more
serious. And it's like, hey, okay, they built this part out.
00:15:58:05 - 00:16:18:05
Stefan
We're still betting on the team, but now we're betting on the product. We're betting on the
market. How big is this actual market? How fast can they grow? I agree with everything that
you've said. One thing though, that they don't talk about with, VCs is how lucky we are to have
someone like Bjorn. So Bjorn is somebody that keeps the relationships year round with
investors.
00:16:18:05 - 00:16:37:09
Stefan
He keeps them updated and a lot of people drop that ball if they if one of the founders isn't
doing it and people, you know, they misunderstand, they think, oh, like I'm not sending emails to
investors, but just because they don't invest now doesn't mean that they won't invest later. And
it's important, what jens said. Keep this relationship and this circle around you.
00:16:37:11 - 00:16:57:16
Stefan
But they should be what we call in sales. Your ICP, you know, people that understand you, they
understand the space that you're in and that they could potentially invest down the road. But
yeah, it's well-said. Regarding though, like the last question I have, on raising money, is that like
in the early days with the seed, like, what were some of the mistakes you made?
00:16:57:18 - 00:17:17:11
Stefan
I mean, there was the one with the zoom call that was pretty funny where you asked them to
call. Yeah. You remember when you asked the guy, can you turn on your to turn on your
camera? And he was like, no. And you're like, all right, let's end this meeting. That wasn't really
a mistake though now that I think about it, but what were some mistakes you made when we
were early in the early days when you were learning how to fundraise?
00:17:17:13 - 00:17:18:17
Stefan
00:17:18:19 - 00:17:47:16
Jens
I mean, it's natural, but I think early on I wanted to impress people. And just think about it. If you
know what you're doing and you know you have a ship to gold, do you have to impress people
or are you more like, good day, I have a ship to gold. Do you want a ticket? But, I have not so
many tickets like you.
00:17:47:17 - 00:18:09:19
Jens
You you need to be quick. So. And this is an attitude of, you know what you're doing, or are you
the kind of guy like, hey, I have this ship. It's amazing. Like, you really, really need to join. And
you, like, nobody's on the ship yet, but it will be a great ship. And so.
