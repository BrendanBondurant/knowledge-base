00:18:09:21 - 00:18:25:10
Jens
Yeah. Like, don't try to impress VCs, but this is hard in the beginning because you you feel like
you have to. And I think, I mean, the most important thing is.
00:18:25:13 - 00:18:53:03
Jens
I always get these calls. It's so annoying. Okay. So, I mean, the first step to becoming better at
pitching to VCs is you need to start pitching to VCs. So you, you you, it's it's not possible to, to
improve pitching if you don't do it. So step number one just pitch two VCs and don't think too
much over it.
00:18:53:10 - 00:19:19:07
Jens
And then there's this other thing. People obsess about pitch decks. And you, you find online like,
hey, here's the pitch deck, how a company blah blah blah raised whatever amount of money.
Okay? The pitch deck doesn't really matter. Like nobody cares. Like, okay, some people, at
some point they will look at the pitch deck, but um, you you need you need you really need one
slide.
00:19:19:12 - 00:19:47:24
Jens
This slide is we we have found gold. Here's how our revenue growth. If you have this slide, then
it's a done deal. And if you don't have the slide, you kind of need a whole back up deck that
somehow still convinces people. And that's really hard. Like so the reality is ideally bootstrap
your startup without funding get it in a place where the startup doesn't need money.
00:19:47:26 - 00:20:11:25
Jens
Okay, so, bootstrap to the place where it works and then have a good plan what you really
would do with the money, because it just it it really sucks if you go to VCs and you're like, please
give me 3 million. We don't know what we're doing. We need the money to build a team and
then we try to figure it out like that.
00:20:11:25 - 00:20:55:04
Jens
That's that doesn't sound like you're on the path to gold. It sounds more like, yeah, whatever.
And maybe you have a super good team, and maybe you can somehow convince people that
with this team, you can build something but I don't know if if I could do it again, build real
attraction and get somewhere and to be honest, I think if you, if you start a startup and you don't
have an experienced founder in the startup team, or at least as an advisor and not like, you
know, not an advisor from somewhere, but really like a friend or something who's a really good
advisor, who who went through the steps in the last
00:20:55:04 - 00:21:31:12
Jens
couple of years, I wouldn't even start a startup because I don't know if I compare my, my, my
ego, my my alter ego today to a few years ago. We were we were rookies. We had no no clue. It
was. It's ridiculous. We we achieved this. So get yourself someone who knows how to do it
because they. So if I would today talk to, first time founder with a few questions, I can destroy
them.
00:21:31:15 - 00:21:41:04
Jens
And just because they are not focused on the right things and they don't understand nothing,
and it's it's just so hard in the beginning to build a startup.
00:21:41:06 - 00:21:43:10
Stefan
I'd push back though on that, like.
00:21:43:13 - 00:21:52:27
Jens
Oh, I don't hear you anymore. Somehow I, I messed up my audio. It's not you. Can you hear it?
00:21:53:00 - 00:22:20:29
Stefan
So. While Jens is figuring out his audio. One of the things that I will say is fundraising. It's
interesting. Yes, it's an important. It is a bit of a distraction, but it is important. And what I
compare fundraising to is kind of like dating. Like with dating. It's interesting. The harder you try
to get the person, the less interested they are, the less interested that you play and the person
that doesn't really need the relationship ends up winning.
00:22:21:01 - 00:22:33:23
Stefan
And then obviously there's FOMO, you know, like as soon as you put the wedding ring on all the
girls, that didn't give you a chance, have they now start coming towards you because you have
a wedding ring and you're taken off the market. And so that's the way I put venture capitalism
and but can you hear me now?
00:22:33:23 - 00:22:34:04
Stefan
Yeah. Are you.
00:22:34:04 - 00:22:37:18
Jens
Good? Yeah. Hey, I also just dropped my ring, so.
00:22:37:21 - 00:23:01:00
Stefan
Yeah, that's that's how I figured. But I push back on that because you said, you know, like, find
an experienced founder. But like, if you look back at all the great companies, like, they might
have had a great, like, founder friend to help them out, like, you know, Mark Zuckerberg with
Peter Thiel and things like that. But I also think a core strength of first time founders is how
much they underestimate, like we underestimated a lot.
00:23:01:02 - 00:23:18:08
Stefan
And I think that's actually a strength, because if you really knew what you know now, you
wouldn't have started WunderGraph. You're like, if I had to go through everything to get to this
point where I'm at now, you would have been like, oh yeah, that that's no, not for me. And I think
also a lot of people
00:23:18:10 - 00:23:35:27
Stefan
Yeah. But like if you know, what do you actually have to go to to start a startup and like you see
all these shows glamorizing these entrepreneurs and everything. But if you talk to a real
founder, he will tell you how hard it is to start a company, how hard it is to go through all these
things and their strength is you actually don't know how hard it is.
00:23:36:00 - 00:23:55:28
Stefan
So I don't know. I would encourage people to try it, just know it's not going to be fun. It's not
going to be easy. It'll be really, really high highs. It'll be really low lows. But I think it's also a
strength of being a first time founder because if you have all the experience, you're experienced
enough to be like, this is this is going to be really tough.
00:23:56:01 - 00:23:58:10
Stefan
Would you agree or would you push back on that?
00:23:58:13 - 00:24:36:05
Jens
I agree and I disagree, so I, I, I would really appreciate if like could talk to me back then with my
ego now just because it could be so helpful at the same time. You wouldn't start many
companies if you had the experience. And I think one of one of the big benefits of, of a first time
founder is, they don't know what they don't know, and everybody thinks you cannot do it and
they don't know that.
