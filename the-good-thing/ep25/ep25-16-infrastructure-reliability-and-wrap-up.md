summary: |
  Kevin emphasizes that boring infrastructure provides comfort because exciting tools often introduce breaking changes, and no one wants 2 AM wake-up calls from infrastructure failures. Jens shares frustration with unreliable vendors who send weekly Slack notifications about issues or fail to notify about outages entirely. Stefan wraps up the episode, thanking Kevin and previewing next week's guest Sam Lambert, CEO of PlanetScale, noting their impressive uptime record even when major cloud providers experience outages.

Jens
We just take GCP, Kubernetes and call it a day.
01:05:34:06 - 01:06:03:13
Kevin
Stability is really comforting, right? Like using tools that aren’t boring means they're probably
going to have a breaking change come through at some point. Which which is, is fine if you're
taking advantage of, you know, some, some new features or, or something new that's really core
to what you're doing. But, you know, especially with infrastructure people, people want boring
infrastructure, because they don't want to wake up at 2 a.m. and hear that everything went
down, you know.
01:06:03:15 - 01:06:04:18
Stefan
No well said.
01:06:04:20 - 01:06:27:25
Jens
And the, the, the sorry. The hardest thing like or the one thing like nobody wants to have is you
don't want to have a vendor. And every week you get a slack notification that something is
wrong, or even worse, it just blows up like customer calls you, hey, your service is down and
your vendor didn't even like you, wasn't even able to tell you.
01:06:27:25 - 01:06:47:16
Jens
Like these are the scenarios like this happens three times and you just switch away. And then I
think that's also like there's some some funny stuff going on between database vendors. And I
think next week we actually have, a database, guy on the, on the on the podcast. Stefan. Right.
01:06:47:18 - 01:07:05:26
Stefan
Yeah. So good segment. Guys. So we are at time. So. Kevin, thank you so much for joining us.
Jens the good thing is, is we're back next week. Next week we're back with Sam Lambert. So
CEO of Planet Scale. And if you've been seeing the Twitter drama, which is funny, but, Planet
Scale does insane, insane uptime 100%.
01:07:05:26 - 01:07:19:28
Stefan
Cloudflare GCP goes down planet scales untouched. So but other than that, we'll have them
next week. Kevin, this was a fantastic app. So thank you so much for joining us. Go get your
morning coffee. Next time that we have you on the podcast, we're going to do it at a little bit of
an easier time for you.
01:07:19:28 - 01:07:21:09
Stefan
But thank you again so much for joining us.
01:07:21:09 - 01:07:23:20
Kevin
No problem. Thank you so much for having me.
01:07:23:22 - 01:07:28:16
Stefan
Awesome. Thanks everybody. And then it takes a couple seconds to.
