And we're live. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing.
Today we have a very special guest. As always, you know my co-host. Jens who is here. He's
not the special guest, but we have Kevin Swiber. Kevin and I pronounce that correctly.
00:00:35:09 - 00:00:36:24
Kevin
Perfect. Thank you.
00:00:36:27 - 00:00:50:25
Stefan
Awesome. Kevin's joining us over from the West Coast. So it is six am for them again. Thank
you so much for joining us so early. We have to have a talk with our content producer so he can
make these a little bit easier for guests that join us on the West Coast. But again, thank you so
much.
00:00:50:28 - 00:00:58:02
Kevin
Oh, yeah. No, no, this is this is fine. Sometimes I like to be awake before the sun is up, you
know? I feel like I'm racing it and then I win.
00:00:58:04 - 00:01:14:09
Stefan
No, no, you definitely won today. So Kevin one sun zero. So great job on that. And thanks again
for joining us. We're really excited today because and the good thing we typically talk about just
kind of like technology, what's happening around in the world. And then we really try to focus it
back on what we specialize in with APIs.
00:01:14:09 - 00:01:31:26
Stefan
And I don't know, I would say you're probably one of the biggest influencers in the API world. I
don't know if you would say that, but for us, we've been following you for a long time. I mean,
you have an amazing experience from being the outreach chair at the open API from working at
stripe. You have a long history at Postman, so if you want I mean, introduce yourself to the
audience.
00:01:31:26 - 00:01:36:21
Stefan
Kind of tell us a little bit about your history and what brought you into the space of APIs.
00:01:36:23 - 00:02:06:20
Kevin
Yeah. So I've been in the API space for, just over 15 years. Yeah. My, when I got started in this
space, I was doing like, you know, software engineering at typical enterprises, and that got into
enterprise architecture. And then, you know, a while back now, started interacting with kind of an
early API community, you know, worked on some some API standards, and then, started
working for API product company.
00:02:06:20 - 00:02:30:27
Kevin
So I went over to Apogee, for a while. We built, gateway and I did some IoT stuff and, you know,
ended up bouncing around to a couple of other startups after that and then landed at postman
for five years. And now I'm sort of working independently, and, you know, having kind of a range
of clients that I work with, they give me a really good kind of 360 view of the API space.
00:02:30:27 - 00:03:03:12
Kevin
So I work with enterprises on their API strategy. I work with API product companies on their
product strategy and go to market strategy. And then I work with investors who are looking to
invest in API companies. So, yeah, really, kind of try to hit every angle of, of APIs. And you
know, what was really interesting and I'm sure we'll talk about is a few months ago, sort of all of
these personas started talking to me about AI and MCP and how that's impacting the industry.
