summary: |
  Jens asks about the Magic Quadrant and major API vendors like Kong, Apogee, and Gravitee. Kevin defends the analyst model, explaining it's not simply pay-to-play and provides valuable third-party evaluation. He describes the API space as the "most difficult Venn diagram" due to vendor overlap and complexity, making analyst guidance crucial for enterprises trying to piece together API programs from multiple vendors with overlapping features.

Kevin
So, you know, often when they're evaluating companies, I'm kind of starting with that as a
baseline and then saying, oh, you know, here's you know, the three different ways they
differentiate or looking at the market and saying, like, here's you know, how the these five
companies are differentiating in this market.
00:27:34:04 - 00:28:05:28
Jens
So if you look at if you look at the the Magic Quadrant these days, like if you look at big players
like like Kong and Apogee and, and gravity and others, where, where do you see the, like the
API space going in terms of vendors? Like, is there like one one winner or is it like iterations or
hype cycles or what's your what's your take on, on on where the magic platform is going.
00:28:06:00 - 00:28:28:23
Kevin
Yeah. Well I mean that's, that's a, that's a whole other game, right. With with the analysts. And I
think it's a, I, I think it's really easy to get, jaded by the analyst model. But I think they actually do
provide a really good service. And, you know, I've worked with analysts from the enterprise
architecture perspective.
00:28:28:23 - 00:28:49:15
Kevin
I've worked with analysts from the vendor perspective. And it's a hard job to have, like a trusted
third party between everyone. Right. And a lot of people think it's like, you know, sort of a pay to
play thing. As a vendor, you pay them so much money, and then you get on the quadrant. And
I've found that's not necessarily the case.
00:28:49:17 - 00:29:13:17
Kevin
You know, typically, for folks who are getting on that quadrant, you're going to be bigger anyway,
because you're one of the top players in the space. So you're probably going to have like, a
subscription to, to Gartner at that point just because of the size of your company. But they, they
constantly mentioned sort of smaller companies that, that aren't that big who certainly aren't
paying them.
00:29:13:19 - 00:29:41:14
Kevin
You know, and, so, yeah, I think looking at the the quadrant is super helpful for folks who don't
have the time and the energy to go really deep into all of these companies and having a
relationship with folks like, like Gartner or Forrester, helps them sort of, speed run in into, into
the space that is really complex.
00:29:41:14 - 00:30:08:24
Kevin
You know, the API space is super complex. I always say it's like, the most difficult Venn diagram
of vendors who are providing services, and some of them overlap, and like trying to figure out
which vendors do I purchase to to piece together my API program is an incredibly difficult task,
because you're going to be buying from three vendors, and maybe they have four things that
overlap all three of them.
00:30:08:24 - 00:30:30:27
Kevin
And you've got to choose which vendors you're going to to actually adopt for, for those certain
features. And it's, it's incredibly difficult. So I think the, the Magic Quadrant, is it can be super
helpful for folks who kind of know where they sit, where they're like, oh, we always buy kind of
the luxury products, right? Like, what is the most luxurious product on here?
00:30:31:00 - 00:30:48:26
Kevin
Well, this one's all the way up into the right. They're probably the most expensive. Let's go with
them. Are there are folks who are like, like, we don't want to commit that much. Like we know
that we're we're kind of early in this. Maybe there's there's someone over here towards the,
closer to the the bottom left, that we should go with.
00:30:48:26 - 00:31:06:16
Kevin
So I think I think it is it is helpful is certainly not everything. I think you can't look at a magic
quadrant, and know for certain where to go. You still almost kind of need a trusted third party in
there to help you out. If it's if it's all brand new to you.
