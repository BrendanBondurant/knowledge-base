Jens
But at the same time, it also feels a bit like the, the, the web becomes like a walled garden
again, because we're we're not exploring the web ourselves. We hand this over to a machine
and then ChatGPT decides for us what is relevant or not, what should we say? And then, I don't
know, a lot of people trust what comes back from an LLM which can also be, a mistake.
00:44:34:24 - 00:44:47:20
Jens
And. Yeah. How do you think about LLMs? ChatGPT, Claude, all these things. How do you think
about changing user behavior and then how it affects the the internet?
00:44:47:22 - 00:45:09:12
Stefan
Real quick before you answer that one, Kevin, I just want to add my mom, my dad, my dad, who
came from, Yugoslavia, who doesn't know anything about technology. He uses ChatGPT my my
wife, like they've stopped googling. They just ask ChatGPT and they assume it's correct. It's it's
blown my mind. And my dad, I asked him a question is like, I don't know, let me ChatGPT it.
00:45:09:15 - 00:45:19:00
Stefan
This man thought Amazon was a hoax. So like it is absolutely changing user behavior. But I
would love to hear your opinion on that.
00:45:19:03 - 00:45:45:23
Kevin
Yeah, I mean for sure it is, right? Like, ChatGPT is like one of the biggest consumer products to
ever launch period. Right. And you know, what is interesting to me is that, the experience almost
reminds me of the early web, where things were very information based. The idea was we're
sharing information with each other.
00:45:45:23 - 00:46:11:18
Kevin
Right. So you have a very plain looking site. Essentially, you're just getting the text. Right. And
that's what's happening with with an LLM. You ask it a question and text, you get a response
back in text. At some point, like we decided, okay, we've got this, this whole presentation layer
that, you know, we're providing folks, how can we improve that experience.
00:46:11:18 - 00:46:46:02
Kevin
And so, you get into all sorts of, you know, cool web design things sometimes kooky web design
things, and you're presenting them with an experience, not just text. Right. And, and we've gone
really, really far with that. You know, some websites look incredible. You can have an incredible
experience on that website. When we talk about, like, LLMS kind of scraping those websites
and providing data, we're losing the entire experience of the web that someone has crafted for
us.
00:46:46:05 - 00:47:23:01
Kevin
And it's it's a trade off that we're making. Right. So I think it makes information incredibly
accessible. You know, we could say that Wikipedia made knowledge and information incredibly
accessible. But to to make it more of a personalized thing. Right? Like the the chat bot can learn
my style over time. It can know when, you know, it needs to ask me to, to go deeper on a
question like it can it could be a very personalized experience for me.
00:47:23:06 - 00:47:54:23
Kevin
I think that is is really going to change a lot of things. Where essentially, you know, you want to
own the experience instead of giving that experience to someone else to present to you. You
want to own the experience yourself. I think there are pros and cons either way. You know, I
think, I've personally enjoyed, the experience of surfing the web and seeing what other people
have created, and the different creative ways they want to present information to me.
00:47:54:26 - 00:48:16:28
Kevin
You know, I don't think it'll it'll it certainly won't go away. That will always be there. Like the the
web's not going to go away. It's just it's too vast. It's too big. You know, it will. Will a lot change
about it, I think. So, you know, ad revenue, right? Like, ad revenue became a huge thing.
00:48:17:01 - 00:48:38:00
Kevin
What happens to ad revenue in a ChatGPT world? You know, and for the folks who went too far,
who were showing me five different ads when I'm trying to review an article, you better believe
I'd rather go to ChatGPT than get spammed with, you know, five different windows. I need to
close in order to read an article.
00:48:38:03 - 00:49:08:15
Kevin
Right. So I think it's it's going to help drive better practices there that care more about the user
experience. But yeah, it's, it's it's interesting like the, the value that folks are getting from
interacting directly with their users, directly with their consumers. That's, that's shifting. And
there's now a third party in the mix. And everyone's kind of beholden to that third party.
00:49:08:15 - 00:49:30:27
Kevin
What information are they going to share with me? You know, what information can I, present
through them back to the user, if anything at all? So I think that there's a lot that we're going to
need to think about moving forward. I know a lot of people are like, I just want all chat bot, all
chat interface, all natural language experience all the time.
00:49:30:29 - 00:49:51:19
Kevin
Because I think they're really excited about it and because I think they're, they're sick of getting
spammed with a bunch of ads. But, you know, we we lose some stuff there too. So I think, you
know, over time, we'll, we'll start to figure out what this really looks like for us. But certainly
there's a shift, there's a change, and we're all going to have to adapt.
