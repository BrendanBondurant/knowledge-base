summary: |
  Jens predicts ChatGPT will adopt Netflix's ad-supported model with premium tiers. The discussion shifts to enterprise LLM adoption reality - while there's hype, most enterprises are just starting with ChatGPT and basic tools like GitHub Copilot before progressing to Cursor and Windsurf. Kevin explains that digital native companies (15-20 years old) adopt AI much faster than traditional companies (300+ years old), with some early adopters already implementing MCP servers and authorization controls.

It's it's also quite likely that at some point, if we, if we look at what, like Netflix and others did, at
some point maybe we will just see ads in ChatGPT. I was going to. Yeah. And then you can
have like the premium version that might not have ads and it's the bit faster and the, the cheap
or free version that it shows you an ad before it gives you your, your text.
00:50:17:18 - 00:50:46:27
Jens
Right. But, on another side, I think what's, what's also cool about, about, the coming back to the,
the chat is the interface in just text. I think it has also also positive effects on accessibility. Like
everybody who had issues using, the, the web in its animated visual form, they, they can now
ask, chatgpt and they can consume it as text or they can they can listen to it.
00:50:47:00 - 00:51:17:04
Jens
So I think that's also like, like that side. So that's that's also a thing. One other question I have is
if you think about, you know, we, we were speaking earlier about, like you're consulting to, to
enterprises. And I'm curious in this, in this, ChatGPT AI world or LLM world, where in reality,
because there's a lot of hype and people who build cool stuff and talk about cool stuff.
00:51:17:04 - 00:51:33:19
Jens
But if you come from an enterprise angle, where do you see, like, real market pull for LLM
tooling? Like, what are the things that enterprises are actually buying and they don't churn? Like
what what is the stuff that sticks?
00:51:33:21 - 00:51:34:11
Stefan
Good question.
00:51:34:11 - 00:52:01:24
Kevin
And in terms of like LLM stuff, I mean, yeah, but most folks are, just trying to figure out ChatGPT
and their technical teams are starting to investigate things like cursor, or more more commonly,
depending on the type of company is, it'll be them getting started with, like, a GitHub copilot,
right. Because they're they're using VSCode already.
00:52:01:26 - 00:52:29:11
Kevin
I do I do see people quickly going from copilot to, to cursor, to, to windsurf to like investigating
cursor and windsurf as soon as they get familiar with copilot. So I, I think it's mostly in kind of
like the technology team adopting this stuff now, and business folks starting to say how do I how
do I get a ChatGPT like experience for the things that I'm asking for?
00:52:29:18 - 00:53:00:21
Kevin
So I think it's very, very early days for, you know, more digital native, I guess companies,
companies who weren't around before the web. Right. Like you've got companies that are like,
300 years old who've been around for a long time, that companies who are 20 years old or 15
years old. For those those newer companies, they are much quicker to adopt, AI and and, and
MCP that I'm working with now.
00:53:00:21 - 00:53:35:22
Kevin
Right. Like they're super early adopters for, for MCP, they're creating MCP servers. They're,
figuring out how to, have authorization controls. And as the safest way possible to present it to
their business users. Like, they're kind of ahead of the curve. And then there are certainly folks
who have been doing, ML for a really long time, you know, prior to the LLM boom, even even
big, like, insurance companies and things like that, mortgage companies.
00:53:35:22 - 00:53:56:24
Kevin
Right. Like, they're, they have tons of data, that, that they can use for various reasons. And
they've been looking into this for, for a while. So I think, there are certainly new technologies in
that space that are very interesting to them, that they can leverage. But I, I would say, like, there
isn't really good in enterprises right now anyway.
00:53:56:26 - 00:54:27:09
Kevin
There isn't really good like deep penetration of AI into those enterprises, smaller companies.
Right. They'll have they'll have like, you know, AI mandates where like, you've got to be using AI
in your job. Some, some larger companies are starting to hire like chief AI officers, to, to kind of
oversee this. And not just on the technology side either, but like on the business side too.
