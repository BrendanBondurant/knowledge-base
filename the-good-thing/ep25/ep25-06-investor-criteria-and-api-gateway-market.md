Jens asks about investment advice, leading Kevin to explain his criteria for evaluating API companies: credibility, relevance, and differentiation.

Kevin
Right. That kind of led to a role where I acted as sort of a field CTO, for a while there. And that
was that was hugely rewarding, right? Because, after spending so much time with all these
different companies and, like, understanding all of their different problems, then you're in a
position to, actually talk about that experience and say, here's what I've seen work, for these
companies or, you know, the position that you're in right now, I know it feels like you're alone in
this, but you're really not like, you know, I've worked with several companies who have been
here before, and here are some things that they're trying,
00:23:58:14 - 00:24:16:29
Kevin
to to ease the pain of these problems that your experience, and that kind of stuff is not only is it,
like, rewarding for me to do, and I think it's rewarding for a lot of people to do. But it really
develops these close customer connections. And like, you're really, you're really in it to help
them succeed, right?
00:24:16:29 - 00:24:40:11
Kevin
Like that. That's part of the job. If they're not succeeding and you're not a part of their success,
then you're not really doing your job. Right. So it's it's well beyond, here's a product that I'm
building that you're buying and that you're implementing, and, and more like, how do we build
these connections that are going to last a long time and be mutually beneficial?
00:24:40:14 - 00:25:05:13
Jens
Yeah, that makes sense. I, I have one question you mentioned earlier. You work with investors.
If I'm, venture capitalist. What what's your suggestion? What what should I invest in? What
should I, not not touch like, what's what what's your current thinking of the of the market from an
investors perspective?
00:25:05:15 - 00:25:41:07
Kevin
That's an interesting question. And saying it's usually kind of more specific, than that. You know,
kind of looking at, the entire market through a particular lens. So, you know, if we, we take
gateways, for instance. Right. There's, a portion of gateways that have really become
commoditized over time. And, you know, I wouldn't say all of what gateways do because I think
gateway companies actually have platforms for the most part.
00:25:41:07 - 00:26:06:21
Kevin
And they they do quite a lot. But, you know, once you start seeing Amazon come out with a
product through AWS and GCP and Azure all have products for something, these are
essentially our utilities. These are essentially the electric company, for tech. Right. And so this
stuff starts to become utility. And they charge utility rates.
00:26:06:21 - 00:26:33:20
Kevin
They charge sort of like, you know, usage based, for, for all the different meters that they might
have. And so, you know, the what I often say to, to product companies as well, is that, and to
investors, what they're looking for is a company that is is credible. So like, they've got, some
experience that means they know what they're talking about.
00:26:33:22 - 00:26:55:02
Kevin
A company that's that's relevant. They're producing something that people actually want today.
And a company that's differentiated, like you're, you're able to look at them and say, here's, you
know, here's what makes them uniquely them, and, and where they sit in the market. So you
can still do all three of those things, and, and be a gateway company.
00:26:55:05 - 00:27:14:11
Kevin
But you've got to understand that there are certain table stakes that are higher now because a
certain portion of what you're doing is utility is commodity. And so you've got to build on top of
that. Right. Like so the bar to entry is higher than it used to be. Could because a portion of this
has gone to commodity.
