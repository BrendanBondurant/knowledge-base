So now a lot of my focus, in the last few months has been on MCP.
00:03:08:20 - 00:03:09:21
Stefan
You know, fantastic.
00:03:09:24 - 00:03:17:03
Jens
We can now all pack up the APIs. They they are not needed anymore. We replace them with
MCP.
00:03:17:05 - 00:03:20:27
Kevin
So you can do a hard pivot. Hard pivot. API to MCP. done.
00:03:20:29 - 00:03:22:09
Jens
It's a new age right.
00:03:22:11 - 00:03:24:15
Kevin
Yeah.
00:03:24:18 - 00:03:26:28
Stefan
It's it's interesting.
00:03:27:00 - 00:03:41:08
Jens
I'm curious about few things. I, I read on Twitter like some time ago that you wrote API
gateways. Did you write the API gateway for Apogee?
00:03:41:11 - 00:04:07:23
Kevin
So I worked on API Gateways for Apogee. We actually had a few, so, for a brief time, I was
managing kind of our, our main gateway team. And then we had, what was called a micro
gateway, for, for a while I was managing that team for a little while as well. And then we had kind
of like this separate open source initiative that I was a part of.
00:04:07:25 - 00:04:44:21
Kevin
And I built, an API gateway called Argo, in Node.js at the time. And that was a little bit more
developer friendly. Like, instead of doing, like config for policies, you did code for policies. And
we ended up sort of integrating that, into the product, at one point. So, so yeah, I mean, and
then sort of post apogee, went to another company where we built this open source gateway
called Express Gateway, which is still out there in the world somewhere, but that company is
now now gone, as startups, tend to do sometimes.
00:04:44:23 - 00:04:46:08
Kevin
But yeah.
00:04:46:10 - 00:05:11:14
Jens
Well, one thing I'm curious about is, you rare on the vendor side, and now you're on the
consulting side. How how how is it different to be a vendor in the API space and to be a
consultant? Like what what's what's the what's what's the biggest difference and what what what
kind of did you learn about companies when you when you switched sides?
00:05:11:14 - 00:05:39:13
Jens
Because like I worked for for tyk technologies for a couple of years now. I'm doing
WunderGraph for a couple of years. I'm on the vendor side all the time. And, you know, one
thing that I learned as a vendor, as you don't always see the whole company, for example,
oftentimes we interact with the platform team, and the platform team is, I wouldn't say like they
shield us, but they are our customer and the users like front end devs, backend devs, designer,
product owner.
00:05:39:18 - 00:05:52:18
Jens
Sometimes we we never really interact with them. So I guess if you're on the consulting side,
you, you see the whole space from from a different angle, like what's what's the biggest
difference?
00:05:52:20 - 00:06:11:26
Kevin
Yeah. Well, I think I always saw the vendor side from a slightly different angle because as I
mentioned before, I got into the vendors, I was doing enterprise architecture stuff at, you know,
enterprises. So I was, I was the person, like, evaluating the vendors, and, you know, giving sort
of a go or. No, go on that before joining the vendor.
