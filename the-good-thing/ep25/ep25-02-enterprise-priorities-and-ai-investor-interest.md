Jens
Because like I worked for for tyk technologies for a couple of years now. I'm doing
WunderGraph for a couple of years. I'm on the vendor side all the time. And, you know, one
thing that I learned as a vendor, as you don't always see the whole company, for example,
oftentimes we interact with the platform team, and the platform team is, I wouldn't say like they
shield us, but they are our customer and the users like front end devs, backend devs, designer,
product owner.
00:05:39:18 - 00:05:52:18
Jens
Sometimes we we never really interact with them. So I guess if you're on the consulting side,
you, you see the whole space from from a different angle, like what's what's the biggest
difference?
00:05:52:20 - 00:06:11:26
Kevin
Yeah. Well, I think I always saw the vendor side from a slightly different angle because as I
mentioned before, I got into the vendors, I was doing enterprise architecture stuff at, you know,
enterprises. So I was, I was the person, like, evaluating the vendors, and, you know, giving sort
of a go or. No, go on that before joining the vendor.
00:06:11:26 - 00:06:35:15
Kevin
So I always sort of brought that experience into what I was doing. And in my, my startup days,
one reason I like working for startups is that I tend to work cross-functionally. So even though I
might be doing like engineering management, you know, I'm also working in, pre-sales capacity,
doing often consulting with, with those customers to figure out where their problems are.
00:06:35:18 - 00:07:00:00
Kevin
You know, what they need? I think when you are in that vendor space, though, it's kind of easy
to forget that you're not the center of the customer's world. Right? And, you know, as as I've
moved into consulting and now have sort of a bigger picture, you know, when I was at Apogee
or postman for us, you know, we're thinking like, okay, let's, let's work on, on this customer.
00:07:00:00 - 00:07:22:26
Kevin
Let's see how we can best provide a solution with our product for this customer. Meanwhile, the
customers, you know, got 15 different initiatives going on. And like, you're just one of them,
right? And so, you know, I think it's, it's easy to, to start wondering as a vendor like, why isn't this
person responding to me? We have to, to move this deal forward.
00:07:22:28 - 00:07:41:16
Kevin
Is it not the right time right now? You know, and trying to avoid things like having a no decision
On The deal, and I think it's, like, really easy to forget that you might get to a no decision on the
deal because that person has changing priorities and you're just a small part of their world.
00:07:41:19 - 00:07:57:07
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. Well said. And, question from my end. So, this consulting side that you're doing
now working with vendors, you also mentioned with investors especially now in this, you know,
field of AI. Like what are you currently seeing from your point of view? Like what are you
advising investors on is like on companies that you're seeing?
00:07:57:07 - 00:08:03:20
Stefan
How do you see AI and, you know, APIs, from an investor's point of view?
00:08:03:22 - 00:08:27:15
Kevin
Yeah. Well, you know, again, the last few months has been a lot of questions about, how is AI
changing everything, you know, how is it, impacting their current investments? Should they be
investing more money? Should they be looking at a new round? Should they be advising their,
you know, portfolio to, to start doing more with AI or MCP?
00:08:27:17 - 00:08:51:03
Kevin
So, I wouldn't say that there has been, an anxiety around it. But, you know, a curiosity for sure.
And, and I think by, you know, the vendors in the startups, I think there's an excitement there as
well. I think, you know, as a product company, there's always in the back of your mind, like, am I
going to be irrelevant?
00:08:51:03 - 00:09:27:06
Kevin
in the next five months, am I going to be irrelevant, you know, in the next year? And so working
to stay relevant is, is an important thing. But yeah, there's certainly I wouldn't say like there was
any panic, recently or anything. But you know, even sort of prior to, AI and MCP taking off, you
know, a lot of the concerns were around, what is actually still relevant in the API space, are
gateways becoming more commoditized?
00:09:27:09 - 00:09:53:09
Kevin
You know, is is design becoming, more important? Is there more opportunity out there, to, to get
sort of a larger customer base? What are the different customer, portfolios out there, between
sort of startup, midsize, enterprise. And you know, what's the the difference in sort of
approaching those markets. So I think all that stuff still exists now.
