summary: |
  Kevin discusses how technologies stay relevant longer than expected, using mainframe computing as an example. The conversation explores how infrastructure companies become "boring" but remain profitable, and how the tech industry exists in a bubble compared to real enterprise adoption. Stefan shares examples of Fortune 500 employees just starting to use ChatGPT while tech workers use advanced AI tools extensively.

Kevin
But now we're wondering, how do we how do we grow our product? How do we stay credible?
How do we stay relevant, going forward in this new AI space.
00:10:03:06 - 00:10:26:06
Jens
You just said what is relevant. But if you turn it around, what would you say? Given what LLMs
can do today and the the trends we're seeing, what would you say, what what's became
irrelevant or what what will fade away from from now on? Well, do you have any observation in
that direction?
00:10:26:08 - 00:10:47:15
Kevin
Well, I mean, I tend to think things stay around for a really long time, right? So, even if it's
dropping in relevance, it will probably still be around for a long time. There are still there's still
plenty of good business to be done in mainframe computing, you know, and and we've largely
gone away from that as an, as an industry.
00:10:47:15 - 00:11:15:18
Kevin
Right. So, but for some people, mainframe computing is incredibly relevant to their day. Right.
So I think, you know, what's popular is probably, a different question. I think you can continue to
make tons of money off of all the software that we've built and all of the different technologies
we've built over the years. But if you want to stay on a wave of what's popular, that's, that's
changing a little bit.
00:11:15:20 - 00:11:40:29
Kevin
You know, I think, I think infrastructure companies are, becoming more boring, to, to folks, which
isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think you kind of want your infrastructure to be boring in some
ways. But, you know, it it's it doesn't always feel good to be like a startup who is trying to get
your name out there.
00:11:41:02 - 00:12:04:09
Kevin
And, you know, try to get some press and try to get some people who love your product. It
doesn't always feel good to to think, oh, maybe my stuff is boring, right? But as, as sort of times
shift and new exciting things come in the way, I don't think it necessarily means things become
irrelevant. It just means the focus is elsewhere.
00:12:04:09 - 00:12:06:08
Kevin
For a time.
00:12:06:10 - 00:12:36:16
Jens
Well, one observation I made is when you when you go to to tech, TechCrunch or press in
general, like you can announce a funding round or you can announce a crazy thing in AI and
everything else, like, I don't know if you're not all new API standard or something or I don't know,
like there's, you know, there there was like a specification thing or like other things like in, in the,
in the, in the, in the surrounding AI noise.
00:12:36:16 - 00:12:48:02
Jens
these days it's extremely hard to do anything with, with APIs or something where, where people
are like that's, that's interesting. Like, yeah how do you see that?
00:12:48:04 - 00:13:25:18
Kevin
Yeah. And I think it's hard as a, tech industry as well, because we are kind of on the bleeding
edge of things and like, we, we are early adopters to a lot of different things. And so, you know,
from our perspective, sometimes it's like, oh, like the whole industry is moving in this one
direction. But if you talk to like, you know, normal people who aren't in, in tech, people who are
just doing their jobs at regular enterprise companies around the world, you know, they aren't
they don't have 15 claude code instances running and trying to automate their whole lives.
00:13:25:18 - 00:13:47:02
Kevin
Right? Like they're they're, just trying to figure out, you know, okay, I'm using ChatGPT. Now my
boss wants to use ChatGPT. What does that look like? Right. So it's. And, you know, they don't
they don't have a whole they're not like, already planning out a whole MLOps thing internally.
You know what I mean? Like, it's.
00:13:47:04 - 00:13:47:15
Stefan
Yeah, I.
00:13:47:16 - 00:14:05:25
Kevin
Yeah, we are looking at, at this and our focus and even the journalists focus, tends to be, Along
where kind of the bleeding edge tech folks are. And I don't, I don't think it really matches what
the regular person is doing out there today.
