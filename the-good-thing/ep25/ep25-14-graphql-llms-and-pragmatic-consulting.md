summary: |
  Stefan praises Kevin's pragmatic "it depends" consulting approach, contrasting it with consultants who have strong opinions without understanding full use cases. Jens reflects on developer maturity, explaining the Dunning-Kruger effect and "Mount Stupid" concept where early knowledge creates overconfidence. Kevin shares his own journey from thinking he had everything figured out to learning about design patterns, then being told he was over-engineering, illustrating the cycle from simple to complex back to simple solutions.

Stefan
So I really appreciate that. It depends type.
00:58:06:05 - 00:58:14:13
Kevin
Know it's frustrating to it's frustrating to tell people it depends. Right. So I don't yeah.
00:58:14:15 - 00:58:16:28
Stefan
No. Well said though, Jens You had another question.
00:58:17:00 - 00:58:49:20
Jens
You know like my and this is just something I don't know. I think hopefully every developer they,
they learn it in, in their career at some point. But I think every developer with enough
experience, it's, it's like, you stop having extremely strong opinions on something because
there's always someone who knows one particular topic better. Like you're either like extremely
broad in your knowledge or you're deep in some specific topic.
00:58:49:23 - 00:59:09:11
Jens
So if you're deep in one topic, you won't know other topics as deep. If you're broad, there's
people who are more deep on one topic. And so I think in general, like one one of the traits I
had as a, as a young developer, you know, I, you know, this probably from the, this
Dunning-Kruger thing. There's this, this mount
00:59:09:11 - 00:59:36:29
Jens
Stupid. I love to refer to that. You learn a little bit about the topic like, you know, early Jens
learns about GraphQL, knows everybody, everything about GraphQL. And then you're, you're
hammer to solve every problem is GraphQL now So you keep only talking about that and yeah.
Until eventually you run into like an enterprise architect. Who who who I don't know who who
sets you back.
00:59:36:29 - 01:00:00:04
Jens
And he's like, dude, this is just one of the many tools we're using. And relax. And you kind of
realize that, okay. Yeah. That's I don't know. Did you also have, like, like a Mount stupid moment
where someone where someone kicked your ass and you kind of realize, okay, I didn't know
everything.
01:00:00:07 - 01:00:23:17
Kevin
Oh, I mean, constantly, you know, I, which is which is why I think my, my attitude and my
approach is so different now than when I was younger. You know, I would I would be like, oh, I
think I have it all figured out. And then someone's like, oh, well, you don't understand all of these
design patterns, or you don't know the solid principles or whatever.
01:00:23:17 - 01:00:40:23
Kevin
And I'm like, oh, okay, I guess, I guess I'll go learn those. And then I'm like, Now I've got it all
figured out. And then folks are like, well, this is too complex for for what you need. Like, why do
you have, a factory, factory, factory, like, just stop. Just stop that. Like, it's too complex. And I
was like, oh.
01:00:40:28 - 01:00:59:22
Kevin
So, like, things are, they always end up being in the middle. There's that, like, bell curve meme,
right? You know, where you start everything simple and and everything's great, and then
everything becomes really super complex, and then you go back to things being really simple
again. And, you know, I think, I think that there's a lot of truth in that.
01:00:59:22 - 01:01:19:16
Kevin
And it's interesting to have like, you know, early career folks in your network and kind of see
them go through this experience of being like, oh, you know, I was so naive. And now I have it
all figured out and here's, here's how everything's going to work going forward. And you're like,
oh, you know, sweet summer child.
