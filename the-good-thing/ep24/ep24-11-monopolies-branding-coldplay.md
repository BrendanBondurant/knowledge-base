Stefan
I think it's interesting. I think Zuck or Mark Zuckerberg, he's probably one of the best CEOs
probably over the last 20 years, especially from a founders point of view. Oh, put up the in the
top categories between like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos. Because every time you think he's out, he
somehow gets back into it. So if you saw he bought a minority stake for 3 billion into Ray-Ban or
to Sunglass Hut, the company that owns Ray-Ban, because he's really pushing for these metal
glasses.
00:56:55:07 - 00:57:17:04
Stefan
Second, he's poaching all these people from OpenAI and he's poaching people from, scale AI.
And to him, this is just pennies. You know, it might be 16 billion, but for meta, it's just pennies on
the dollar. For them, the outcome is is massive. And so if you see right here, though oh switched
up the view. There we go.
00:57:17:08 - 00:57:42:10
Stefan
If you see right here though right under where I highlighted the superintelligence lab discussions
are preliminary and no decisions have been made on potential changes. I think that they wrote a
news article to get views, but this is still no decision has been made. And then the last one that I
think is important here is that this year, the Chinese AI company Deepseek released an
advanced AI chat bot, thanks in part to the US open source code.
00:57:42:12 - 00:58:04:24
Stefan
I don't know, they might also be getting government pressure. So if you've seen anthropic won a
military deal of 200 million with the government, ChatGPT has a deal with the government. Is it
the US government possibly could be facing, government pressure to make it closed source?
Because if you think about it, we're in kind of like not a nuclear arms race, but an AI arms race
with other countries as well.
00:58:04:26 - 00:58:11:23
Stefan
And so there's AI, there's Russia in play, and then there's the US. So this possibly could even be
a political reason of why they're getting pushed to it.
00:58:11:26 - 00:58:21:17
Jens
But those what what you're saying is if they built such a powerful model, they shouldn't give it
away for free to everybody else.
00:58:21:19 - 00:58:42:24
Stefan
I'm not saying that, I think the government might be saying that it's definitely a race right now,
and the government might want us to keep it proprietary with the US, especially if this has the
capabilities. I think David, he, he linked it was like AI 2075 or whatever. And it talks about how
governments use AI to overthrow other governments.
00:58:42:27 - 00:59:05:25
Stefan
Just releasing it across the mainframe, turning off technologies, pretending to be employees,
things like that. Obviously, it's a little bit of science fiction, but you never know. Maybe the
government's pressuring meta. And one super interesting thing that you said. So you say
government, meta is an advertising company. Do you know why they pitched themselves as an
advertising company?
00:59:05:27 - 00:59:07:09
Jens
Repeat.
00:59:07:11 - 00:59:28:09
Stefan
You said meta is an advertising company, right? It's an ads company. Yep. Okay, so I was
reading this cool thing, this article basically about how, startups and monopolies, they will hide
themselves. A startup will be like, look at me, look at my logo wall. I'm a big company. I'm a big
company. And when I'm up and a monopoly will be like, I'm actually not that big.
00:59:28:09 - 00:59:46:07
Stefan
This is the video that you sent me. Do you remember from, from Peter Thiel? Yeah, yeah. And,
so Facebook or we'll use Google. In this sense, Google is not a search company because if it
was, it would be a complete monopoly. Google is in the advertising space. Advertising is $1
trillion industry, and Google is a very small player into it.
00:59:46:15 - 00:59:55:28
Stefan
It's the same thing with Facebook. They're a very small player in the global advertising thing, but
if they were in the social network space, they would be a monopoly.
00:59:56:00 - 01:00:04:27
Jens
Yeah. Interesting. So what what what are we? We are we're in the computer market, right?
01:00:04:29 - 01:00:14:13
Stefan
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Technically, I mean, if we were in the Federation one. Yeah, we'll be
a monopoly there soon.
01:00:14:16 - 01:00:16:01
(Mix)
But okay.
01:00:16:03 - 01:00:21:07
Stefan
Any last minute topics? Anything you want to add before we sign off for the day?
01:00:21:10 - 01:00:27:00
Jens
And any last insults from the chat?
01:00:27:02 - 01:00:31:01
Stefan
Jen's messaging me on slack. Unshare. Maybe I like to. Yeah.
01:00:31:03 - 01:00:38:10
Jens
No, I, I switched the view. Because if you go, like, on the monologue, then I think it's, it's better if
you have the full view.
01:00:38:13 - 01:00:41:05
Stefan
If I go on the monologue or if you go on the monologue.
01:00:41:07 - 01:00:43:10
(Mix)
Yeah.
01:00:43:13 - 01:00:44:12
(Mix)
That, that that's.
01:00:44:12 - 01:00:48:18
Jens
A funny one. Should we even talk about this or.
01:00:48:20 - 01:00:48:24
(Mix)
We.
01:00:48:24 - 01:01:06:13
Stefan
Can save it for next week, but yeah, basically, don't go to a, don't go to Coldplay concerts with,
your, your people person, your chief. That is crazy, by the way. Like, I look them up on LinkedIn
like he's CEO and she's chief people officer. They're both married.
01:01:06:15 - 01:01:13:23
Jens
Yeah. I don't know why Coldplay. Like, if it was any other concert, it would have worked.
01:01:13:25 - 01:01:31:28
Stefan
Well, you know what I was saying? I was talking to Sofia about this. Like what? The Coldplay
concert. Like one. They were probably, like, holding each other and singing this song and being
like, wow, like, this is so beautiful. We're so alive. Like, I love Coldplay now. They probably
absolutely hate Coldplay. And second, if they would have just reacted normal, just like, hey, like,
how are you?
01:01:31:29 - 01:01:43:11
Stefan
Like whatever. Nobody would have cared and they wouldn't have blown up on social media. It's
because of the way they reacted that it got blown up. And then I got exposed.
01:01:43:14 - 01:02:08:27
Jens
I don't know, I, I really struggle with this, with this whole scene because it, it, it is incompatible
with, with my view of a relationship, you know, like, hey, how how can you be happy going to a
concert with the person that's not your wife? And obviously you're in the setup that.
01:02:09:00 - 01:02:10:28
(Mix)
I don't know. I have world.
01:02:10:28 - 01:02:23:20
Jens
Views, you know, like when like I work for wundergraph and then on the weekend I do
something with my family, with my kids, with my like, these are my loved ones.
01:02:23:23 - 01:02:25:06
(Mix)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:02:25:08 - 01:02:28:20
Jens
I don't know. I have really no comment about this whole thing.
01:02:28:23 - 01:02:31:17
Stefan
You should watch the Tiger Woods documentary then.
01:02:31:19 - 01:02:32:24
Jens
The what?
01:02:32:26 - 01:02:35:20
Stefan
The Tiger Woods documentary.
01:02:35:22 - 01:02:38:25
Jens
Tiger woods. Okay. Yeah.
01:02:38:27 - 01:02:46:23
Stefan
the good thing?
Some view of pleasure. Well, guys, thank you so much for a great episode. And, Yeah. What's
01:02:46:25 - 01:02:53:29
Stefan
We're back next week. Sometimes I feel like you forget it, but you're like, wait, that's a good
thing. Thanks, guys.
