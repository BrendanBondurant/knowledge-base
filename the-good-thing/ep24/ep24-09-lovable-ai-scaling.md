summary: |
  Stefan and Jens analyze Lovable's impressive metrics including unicorn status, 75M revenue, and massive user growth. While acknowledging the achievement, Jens questions long-term defensibility against established AI coding tools and whether Lovable can scale beyond being a scaffolding tool. They compare the current environment to the dot-com bubble while recognizing successful companies can emerge from such periods.

What is this a cult? .. WunderGraph!
00:46:19:14 - 00:46:21:13
Jens
WunderGraph!
00:46:21:16 - 00:46:45:27
Stefan
All right, all right, you're done. You're done. Next topic. Help me understand this, is are we in a
bubble? What is going on? How is vibe coding growing? So, fast. So, me, Jens and Bjorn were
actually talking about this today. So. Okay, let me share my screen. But basically Tldr is lovable
has about 80 million in revenue.
00:46:45:29 - 00:46:58:12
Stefan
They've just gotten unicorn status after eight months after launch, which by the way, I don't think
it's true. It's not eight months like they've been building the product for like a year before that.
And then they launched it.
00:46:58:15 - 00:47:00:17
(Mix)
But they.
00:47:00:19 - 00:47:25:16
Stefan
Just raised a 200 million. I think it's the largest series A in European history, which is pretty
crazy. This is crazy, by the way. So they have 180 paying customers, and they have revenues of
75,000,000 in 7 months, but they have about 2.3 million users. And they also have 45 full time
employees, which I thought was interesting.
00:47:25:18 - 00:47:30:18
Jens
Oh, I would love to know their churn rate.
00:47:30:20 - 00:47:36:07
(Mix)
Yeah. I don't know.
00:47:36:09 - 00:47:55:25
Stefan
10 million projects that have been created on the platform to date. I mean it's impressive
though, you got to be honest. Like okay, so they've given the ability to code to anybody. You just
prompt, which is great. Every day, brilliant founders and operators with game changer at the
same. Oh they don't have a developer. It's really quickly like yeah it's fair.
00:47:55:27 - 00:48:18:00
Stefan
For example, this company was made by a large Brazilian and they Brazilian edtech and they
grossed 3,000,000 in 40 eight hours. But what do you think? Like we were talking about this, is
this defensible? Is this something that can actually grow and like become a legitimate company?
I think it can also Replit just hit 100 million in ARR, so I don't know.
00:48:18:00 - 00:48:23:29
Stefan
I think we're in an interesting time.
00:48:24:01 - 00:48:55:01
Jens
I, I yeah, I don't know, like, well, what I saw is so they raised 200 million I mean first of all, don't
don't get me wrong because you, you you might be like, oh, they are doing so much better than
then WunderGraph. And I'm grumpy and blah blah blah. I'm, I'm absolutely not like it's it's
phenomenal what they have built and we're, we're not comparing ourselves to to what they are
doing.
00:48:55:04 - 00:49:17:20
Jens
And it's great work. What I'm thinking about is okay, so now they have 200 million. I did a little
bit of research and what they have or what it seems they have figured out is that, a lot of
companies, they, they, they, don't use lovable. And when companies use lovable, someone
creates like an example or like a draft.
00:49:17:22 - 00:49:51:08
Jens
And then at some point they hand this over to developers and, then developers turn it into like a
real project or scale it. I think we also haven't seen, like, how will something like lovable work
like over multiple years, like a lovable app and for me, the reality is I already know what
happens when a lovable app scales because, if you hand it over to developers and they
continue using AI, that means we're back to claude, we're back to cursor, and there already is
cursor.
00:49:51:08 - 00:50:35:04
Jens
There already is claude. And like there's another thing like, from open API. No, OpenAI has a
tool. Gemini has a tool like there's so much competition in the market of, helping developers to
code. And this right here is allowing anybody to start creating a project. And I'm Wondering, in
the long term, if they're if if they hit hard limits, is it possible that lovable will forever be the
scaffolding tool where I build a tiny project, but it will never scale to be like a big project?
00:50:35:06 - 00:51:18:17
Jens
And I'm. Yeah, I'm just wondering like, what's the what's the long term trajectory? Obviously it's
it's phenomenal. Like in eight months to 75 million ARR. That's absolutely crazy. And it seems
they can continue with, with that growth. It's just a question of if other if other companies will,
will, will start competing more and more like I think Google has an app builder and there's others
and if there will be like a hard physical wall where you just can't scale lovable to like big multi-
team approaches, whatever, then the the question is like, what?
