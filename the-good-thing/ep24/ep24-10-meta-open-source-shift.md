summary: |
  Stefan and Jens discuss Meta's potential shift away from open source AI models, analyzing the practical implications of 2 trillion parameter models that only major companies can run. Stefan suggests government pressure due to AI arms race concerns with China and Russia, while Jens considers how changing user behaviors away from traditional web browsing might be affecting Meta's advertising-dependent business model.

Jens
What will happen to this company in, in the long run, if you get 200 million series A, you need to
to somehow bring back this money in terms of revenue and, yeah, that's, that's a massive
challenge.
00:51:34:17 - 00:51:54:18
Stefan
I would say. Also, I also think it's phenomenal to like, first of all, it's one of Europe's fastest
growing and latest unicorns. So also it's great for the European tech ecosystem. I don't know I
don't know what's going to happen. I think who knows because it feels like we're in the.com
boom. Like you remember everybody was like, remember Pets.com.
00:51:54:18 - 00:52:13:16
Stefan
All these companies making money, raising money like, what was the company? Something
Cloud from Andreessen Horowitz before I got acquired. Like it wasn't even amazing business. It
just got acquired by HP and a great outcome. But like, he was able to grow it really fast with a
lot of venture capital funding. I think we might be in a bubble.
00:52:13:18 - 00:52:32:29
Stefan
I don't think that's a bad thing. People that survived the bubble, those companies stay for life. So
that's fantastic. But I don't know. I still think it's an insanely impressive. Also, I wonder what it
feels like. Imagine being at something that's just from 0 to 8 months, 80 million in revenue.
That's crazy. So it's definitely a rocketship.
00:52:33:01 - 00:52:38:28
Jens
Yeah. Like.
00:52:39:00 - 00:53:14:14
Stefan
It it is what it is. Okay. And now the last one. All right. This one's interesting. Why is this guy in
the video? This guy's so annoying. You've probably seen this guy, but next topic, unless you
have anything else to say for the last one, I going to wrap on this topic. Okay, so this is a New
York Times article by matter's new superintelligence lab is discussing a major strategy change
their new chief AI officer, Alexander Wang.
00:53:14:14 - 00:53:39:20
Stefan
So this is the founder of scale AI that Facebook or Meta bot. He's thinking of developing a
closed source one versus an open source one. That's him right there. This is also, what's his
name? That really annoying guy on Twitter drives me crazy. But basically they've been open
sourcing all their models. They're thinking now to keep it closed sourced.
00:53:39:22 - 00:53:51:29
Stefan
What are your thoughts on that? Especially us being an open source company. It's kind of
interesting to see. I'm wondering why they're thinking this, whether it's something with China's
deep seek or it's just something in general.
00:53:52:01 - 00:54:25:06
Jens
So if I did a little bit of research and if you think about it, the the models they are building, like if
I, if I got it right, one sec, where's my where's my summary? I think the model will have like 2
trillion parameters. Yeah 2 trillion parameters. And the question here is if you have such a
model, the the hardware, it would take you to actually run it.
00:54:25:08 - 00:54:57:26
Jens
There's just a bunch of companies on the planet who could run this model. And then there's the
question like if you if you open source, it, open sourcing needs to have some benefits. Like if we
open source cosmo router, then a lot of people can can run it. It can run on commodity
hardware. If you model if you open source a model that requires, I don't know, a whole data
center of GPUs, like, are you donating this to Jeff Bezos or what's going on?
00:54:57:26 - 00:55:24:18
Jens
So I don't know. I, I'm not sure if that's such a such a big topic, to be honest. It's a big switch for,
for meta to go away from from open source. Yeah. But I don't know what you, what you see is
like meta is, is an ads company and as someone selling ads with the changes we currently see,
you know, the behavior of users, it changes.
00:55:24:20 - 00:55:52:07
Jens
Instead of surfing the web or going to Facebook and, and, like interacting with the website. Now
you have people they open like chatGPT. They ask whatever. It gives you the answer back.
People don't surf on websites anymore. Or, another thing that, I know, I don't know if you also
have this in the, in the US, but in, WhatsApp you can now also chat with an AI.
00:55:52:09 - 00:56:19:03
Jens
So not not necessarily. You have to interact with these websites and, yeah, this can also affect
the business model of, of, ads. So I don't know, maybe maybe that change is going to happen
to, to metas business model. So I don't know how how Facebook will continue in the, in the
future. Like, I'm not using it for many years now.
00:56:19:03 - 00:56:25:04
Jens
I don't know, never, never use it that much. But yeah. What are your thoughts?
