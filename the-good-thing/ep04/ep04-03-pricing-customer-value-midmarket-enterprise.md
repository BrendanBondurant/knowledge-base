Jens
He was talking about, like, he's building some AI whatever thing, like he builds things. We know
that. But, he he did a post and he said something like, blah, blah, blah. See how much value
you get for $8 a month? And to be honest, like in my life, I never want to create anything again
that sells for $8 a month because I don't know that.

00:07:24:27 - 00:07:55:09
Jens
What a miserable life like. Imagine you have like like, okay, let's let's do a little bit of math. $8,
ten customers, 80 bucks, a hundred customers, 800 bucks, a thousand customers. Eight. What
is it, eight K so 8000 MRR. And you have eight. What 8000 customers, right?

00:07:55:12 - 00:07:56:21
Stefan
Yeah.

00:07:56:23 - 00:08:03:18
Jens
Like, how do you do support for 8000 people with eight K MRR?

00:08:03:20 - 00:08:06:04
Stefan
It's actually a thousand customers. So a thousand.

00:08:06:07 - 00:08:09:12
Jens
Okay. Yeah. It's all still a thousand customers.

00:08:09:12 - 00:08:31:16
Stefan
So on I mean support for them is like a high tech. Like there's no personalization like you're just
talking to them. But imagine if you had 10,000 customers. It's 80,000. So you just broke 1
million ARR with 80,000, MRR but 10,000 customers. It doesn't make any point at that scale.

00:08:31:18 - 00:08:59:29
Jens
To 10,000 customers. How many support stuff will you have? How many engineers working on
the product for? For a million ARR. And depending on where you hire them, you won't get very
far. So I don't know, like in, in, in general, I also what I also found is theres a correlation between
what people pay and how they behave.

00:08:59:29 - 00:09:32:00
Jens
And for whatever reason, somehow the people who pay more, they treat you better. They they
treat you with with more respect. The worst customer interactions I ever had was with people
who came in, and they tried extremely hard to haggle you down and then like, like they wanted
to have like, crazy price and then customer interaction. They were extremely, extremely
demanding.

00:09:32:03 - 00:10:07:25
Jens
They never respected the time. And they they wanted everything, every feature. And they just
just, I don't know, super annoying. And, I don't know, for me, I'm, I'm kind of done with, with, like
tiny, like tiny tiny like super tiny markets. What I really love is self-serve. That kind of starts at
like $500. So for example, if you if you look at, like, Cosmo, like obviously our money like the,
the big money, we're making it from enterprise.
