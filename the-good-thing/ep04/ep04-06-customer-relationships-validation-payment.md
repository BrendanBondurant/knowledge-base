Just build whatever and somehow get somehow build relationships with big companies and
through whatever you have built, talk to them, ask questions, listen and figure out what other big
problems do they have and can you bring value? And and then you you iterate. And if you listen
to enough people and if you see patterns and then eventually you build a Cosmo and and solve
it, and then yeah, then you start expanding.

00:16:51:03 - 00:17:21:20
Jens
So in the beginning, like, you know, when we started out, I had like all sorts of visions and
whatnot, and it really doesn't matter because, of course you need to have the ability to see
something in the market that others don't see. It's very important. But ultimately just connect,
connect with with customers with the right kind of customers, with customers who have who
have problems that they are willing to pay for, find the pattern.

00:17:21:20 - 00:17:51:23
Jens
And then, yeah, it sounds so easy. But oftentimes especially like technical founders, like I fell
into the same trap. You you are a bit shy. You're afraid of talking to people because if you have a
great idea and you talk to people, it is possible that your that your bubble pops. Like the moment
you ask people like, hey, I have this wonderful thing.

00:17:51:23 - 00:18:13:18
Jens
And the moment you ask people about it, like reality kicks in and it means you have to stop
building. So the the best thing is, if you don't ever talk to anybody, you can just keep building.
It's like building is so much fun. If you're young, you have infinite runway, you live with your
parents, whatever. Like you don't need money so you can build forever.

00:18:13:21 - 00:18:38:21
Jens
But yeah, it's it's, it's a great way of learning how to build software. It's the worst way of learning
how to build a business. And then the the the hard truth is, if you're a technical founder and you
want to build a business, either you or your co-founder, someone has to be like, really interested
in talking to people and solving problems for them.

00:18:38:21 - 00:18:52:09
Jens
And the biggest part of that is actually not writing code. It's talking, listening, asking the right
questions and, and, understanding the market and it's hard.

00:18:52:12 - 00:19:11:03
Stefan
Yeah, but but I think you missed one key thing there though is like, you should talk to these big
companies, but they should pay you, right. Any amount they need to put a credit card or
something. Because you remember the early days of Wunder Graph SDK we talked to? I'm not
going to say their name, but we talked to a company for how long we had slack connect with
them.
