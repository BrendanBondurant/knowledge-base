Stefan
We built stuff for them and they just kept, well know this huge brand. Everybody knows it. And
we talked to them for months, almost a whole year. They never put their money where their
mouth is. They never purchased anything from us.

00:19:23:21 - 00:19:53:05
Jens
Yeah. This is the very dangerous thing like story. What happened to us? Big company engineer
wants to achieve a goal. I cannot blame them. They just try to do something. And they told us if
you could, like, we could stop procurement. But actually we can't because yeah, your software
is lacking something. And our software was open source. So they said like, could you not fix this
bug or add this feature?

00:19:53:07 - 00:20:23:13
Jens
Then I could go to my manager and do whatever. And this is not how you build a business
because you want to solve a problem where there is willingness to pay. And if they don't let you
through to the manager, what it actually means is yes, there is a problem and there is interest to
solve it, but actually not enough pressure to to convince the manager.

00:20:23:13 - 00:20:47:25
Jens
So they want don't want to put their name on the line. They want don't want to risk anything. So
if the guy you're talking to, if they are not willing to risk anything, if nobody wants to pay, is it
really an important problem that you should be solving? Is there is there a business? If people
ask you to do stuff for free?

00:20:47:28 - 00:21:08:16
Stefan
No, and there's not. And when I was in San Francisco, I met the founder of zip. Zip is like a
procurement software. And when they first started out, you know, this Jens, they, they got ten
customers and, they got them to pay. And for three months, they didn't give them the software
they were building it at, like, they didn't have it yet.

00:21:08:16 - 00:21:25:24
Stefan
They were just out, but they got them to pay. But it's exactly what you said. The problem was so
big that this head of procurement was willing to put their credit card down and say here and like,
I will help you build it. I will give you the feedback because I need something like this. That's
literally how they pitch.

00:21:25:25 - 00:21:46:24
Stefan
They were like, I will build you the perfect solution, but you have to pay for it. And for three
months they didn't get the software, they didn't give it to them, but they built it with them. And
then now they just raised a series D and they have their basically the procurement software
now. But it's exactly what you said is that people were willing to pay for it because it was such a
big enough problem that they were willing to wait three months of not even having a solution.

00:21:46:28 - 00:22:00:12
Stefan
Would you trust a random company with your credit card if they don't give you the solution? Not
unless the problem that you actually have is something you're willing to bet against. So yeah, I, I
agree with you. It's kind of crazy and.
