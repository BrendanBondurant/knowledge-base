Jens
Took two takes on this. I think sometimes first time founders have a huge advantage because
they, they are inexperienced. This is. Yeah. No, the thing is, everybody says that's impossible.
That's not gonna work. First time founders have no fucking clue what they are doing. They don't
know that it doesn't work. So they just build it and make it work.

00:52:38:20 - 00:53:02:29
Jens
And it's it's, Yeah, that's sometimes that's that's the trick. And and the second thing I can say like
two words, first time founders or people who are trying to set up, a company trying to get some
funding. One thing you will, you will hit a lot is, is, rejection from from VCs. It's like just.

00:53:03:01 - 00:53:04:23
Stefan
Yeah, inevitable.

00:53:04:25 - 00:53:31:06
Jens
Yes. And then you you have to you have to put this through a filter. And that's, that's one thing in
particular. That's, that's I think it's, it's such a big mistake in how many, how many VCs think this
way. It's like they look at you, they look at the market like, you know, VCs most of VCS they are
like pattern matching.

00:53:31:08 - 00:53:35:13
Jens
They, they they are no magicians. They they just look at patterns.

00:53:35:13 - 00:53:38:26
Stefan
They're they're looking for the next Uber or Airbnb based on what they've seen.

00:53:38:26 - 00:54:23:24
Jens
Yeah. But here's, here's the problem. So they look at you, they look at the market you're in and
they do some extrapolation and they are like market is too small like we cannot invest. Market
is too small. Not gonna work. And I think that like the what's what's fundamentally and you know
that that's discussion like we like our, our our seat investor Steve he's such a, such a great
person to to, to have such deep discussions and, and we, we have this ongoing discussion
around is it the market or is it the founders, like if you want to have like $1 billion company.

00:54:23:26 - 00:54:25:09
Stefan

00:54:25:11 - 00:54:49:25
Jens
Is it about the founders who, who or is it about the company being at the right time, like, luck
and all these kind of things and, you know, like this, there's one, one train of thought that that's
like, if you build a startup and there comes a wave and the startup is in the right position, it can
just ride this wave and boom, billion dollar company.

00:54:49:27 - 00:55:14:09
Jens
And then there's this other train of thought where you can say, okay, there's this wave and
there's the there's a startup, it's in the wrong place. But the founders, they are smart and they
recognize this and they react and they bring the company into the into the right place. And they,
are responsible for that. I'm not sure.

00:55:14:09 - 00:55:46:14
Jens
Like what what is the right thing, but regarding VCs and pattern matching, I, I sometimes think
like, you know, don't get stuck on market size. Just one, one, one way of thinking differently is if
this team gets it right, it's possible that they create a completely new market because the way
people work changes. For example, AI everything changes.

00:55:46:19 - 00:56:15:05
Jens
Nobody is able or nobody was able to predict what's going to happen with AI so why some like I
just don't understand why sometimes it's so important for VCs to think about market size and
then just another way to think about it is, what kind of market could this founder create? And
yeah, that's just my my $0.02 here.

00:56:15:08 - 00:56:30:07
Stefan
It's spot on because like look at the market Airbnb created. Like it didn't exist before. It was like
you could sleep at your friend's house or like you had an extra room and you didn't do much
with it. And then now it's like this whole new market in an economy of like, Holy crap, I can lease
out my room.

00:56:30:07 - 00:56:53:16
Stefan
I can get people to stay in my apartment when I'm not there. Like, and then it created this billion
dollar company. Same thing with Uber is that this for me is the coolest thing ever. Like airports
don't change much and when they do, it's a giant reconstruction. Every airport in the world now
unless like they have like some boycott against Uber has a designated spot for Uber that
completely changed the transportation industry.

00:56:53:17 - 00:57:17:24
Stefan
And for me, it's like you can't see that when you meet Travis Kalanick, but you can see that
Travis Kalanick or Jens is like, damn this guy. He can do something. I don't know if he can do it
like I think he can, but he can create something. I'm going to bet on him. And I think for early
stage companies, you should always bet on the founder if you really see something in him,
because you kind of just gave me a good analogy.

00:57:17:24 - 00:57:35:20
Stefan
I feel like, I don't know, you're mostly into skiing, but like here in Florida, like I've gone surfing
before. Surfing is a lot of waiting. You're waiting on the board and it's kind of like a startup.
You're building, you're building, you're building. But then you see that wave, whether it's AI,
whether it's Federation, or whether it's whatever. And that's when you ride the wave.

00:57:35:20 - 00:57:54:28
Stefan
And I think good founders are the ones that are building and they're looking for silver, but they're
looking for that golden wave. And when that wave comes, they pivot right on to it. Because, for
example, how many companies do you remember during Covid that exploded, like all these like
voice chat companies or like cameo or whatever, they rode the wave of the pandemic.

00:57:55:03 - 00:58:10:16
Stefan
A lot of them crashed afterwards. You know, they had the crazy evaluations and everything. But
the founders did go. You can't argue the founders are pretty successful. Maybe the company
didn't do good, but as a founder, you need to be reactive. You need to be able to ride these
waves whether or not it aligns with the mission or not.

00:58:10:18 - 00:58:13:10
Stefan
What do you think?

00:58:13:13 - 00:58:57:28
Jens
It's it's difficult because, you know, you have companies, extremely good market, bad founders,
still successful. You have other companies, best founders in the world like market, horrible. Like,
it's it's it's tough and yeah, I don't know, it's it's it's like a mixed bag. I mean, we're, we're
founders. So we're obviously super biased on, on, on in terms of founders, but yeah, to be
honest, I think, you can be a good founder you should be a good founder, but ultimately you,
you need to be in the, in the, in the right market.

00:58:57:28 - 00:59:01:03
Stefan
You market always wins.
