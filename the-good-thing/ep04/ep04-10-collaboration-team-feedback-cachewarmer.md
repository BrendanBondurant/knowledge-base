Jens
That's why we do it.

00:40:11:08 - 00:40:32:08
Stefan
But so like my two points, while you were going on your little monologue. Yeah, look at that. You
need a water break. No, jokes aside, so, like, caring. And I want to tell two stories. One is we
recently got an application from a candidate for a position that we don't even have. Like, we
don't even have this position.

00:40:32:11 - 00:40:52:02
Stefan
But he went and he demonstrated, like, why he would be a good asset to the company. He
wrote this giant long email of the things that he would own, the things that he would create and
how passionate he is about it. And then he actually went and took a bunch of our videos and he
clip and he's like, this is how I envision you guys would do it.

00:40:52:08 - 00:41:05:27
Stefan
So we're not even hiring for like a content creator. But he got mine, and Jens attention to the
point that we were talking about him for two days, like, wow, like this type of passion and this
type of care and you can see that people, when they care about something, how much different
they are to work with.

00:41:05:27 - 00:41:23:20
Stefan
And when you care about something, it's what makes working at a company a superpower.
Because if the company truly cares about the problem that they're solving, you feel like you can
rely on them for anything. And one small antidote that I had is this was like a life lesson that,
like, completely changed my mind when I was in college.

00:41:23:22 - 00:41:38:16
Stefan
I just signed to play college soccer. I felt like a hot shot, you know, like I'm going to a school that
costs 90,000 a year, and I'm going for free. And, during the winter break, my mom was like, you
need to get a job. And I was like, mom, like, I'm going to school for free. She's like, you need to
get a job.

00:41:38:19 - 00:41:55:27
Stefan
So she gave me a job. I got a job in a restaurant for like two months. And I was like, oh, like,
why do I need a job? Like, I'm a college soccer player. I go to college for free, I'm a big shot.
And, they gave me a job as a, like a bar hand or like, like basically just helping out in the
restaurant cleaning stuff.

00:41:55:29 - 00:42:08:12
Stefan
And, one of the managers was like, hey, can I see you? And I was like, yeah. He goes, this plate
isn't really that clean. Neither is that one, like, what's going on? And I was like, oh, come on,
man. Like it's just to play it like, who cares? And he's like, let's go outside. And he pulls me to
the side.

00:42:08:12 - 00:42:24:12
Stefan
He's like, listen, I understand your college soccer player. I understand like, you know, this to you
is a small task, but he's like, I care about this. This to me is my college soccer. This to me is
being on the field. And he's like, I care. And he's like, I'm going to tell you something. And like,
maybe you'll listen to me.

00:42:24:12 - 00:42:42:23
Stefan
Maybe you don't. But I love this. This to me is my passion. And he's like, when somebody
comes in and they don't care. And that reflects badly on me. It hurts me. And he's like, for me,
what's most important is that how you do anything is how you do everything. So he's like,
hopefully that helps you as a lesson.

00:42:42:26 - 00:42:58:21
Stefan
And I remember that's smacked me in the face. I was like, Holy crap. Yeah, he's right. Like
something that I care about might be completely different from what he cares about. But that to
him was his college soccer. And it's the same thing that I see at Wunder Graph is that we hire
people that truly care about their whatever it is.

00:42:58:21 - 00:43:17:03
Stefan
You know, Dustin with his telemetry pipelines, David with composition is that they actually care
and they don't just put out crap is that they put out the best of their ability because they
genuinely care about the problem they solve. And so for me, that's what I like about Wunder
Graph. And then second, let's go back on the the customer feedback.

00:43:17:03 - 00:43:40:01
Stefan
So, DeLeon founders, fund guy, he said you can't ab way your your way to success like billion
dollar companies are started because somebody has a crazy vision and they're like a train.
They just go they're Elon Musk with SpaceX. He's like, I want to commercialize private space
travel. He didn't ask for feedback from customers. He just did it.
