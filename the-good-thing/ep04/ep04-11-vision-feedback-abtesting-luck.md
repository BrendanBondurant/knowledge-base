Jens
That's a very good question. Sometimes people ask us to to solve a problem. And one one of
the, I would say one of the traps you can, you can get yourself into is when customers come to
you and ask you to build a solution like, can you build me this? Can you like I need this specific
solution.

00:44:42:29 - 00:45:07:29
Jens
And the problem with this is most of the time it's not that the customer is wrong. The problem is
the customer. They typically they work in their own domain. And what we do GraphQL federation
is for them a little bit like an alien thing. Like it's not their normal day to day work. It's just it's a
means to an end.

00:45:07:29 - 00:45:31:27
Jens
It solves a problem. But the real problem is e-commerce or something else. And so sometimes,
you know, you have very smart people in these companies and they think about their problem
and, they don't even tell you the problem. They tell you because they are typically not
entrepreneurs or not like, like founder mode or product people. They are engineers.

00:45:32:00 - 00:46:12:09
Jens
And the the biggest issue you have with engineers is they want to solve problems. So they
come to you and say like, hey, I hear solution. And I would say the most important thing at that
point is take a step back and figure out what is the problem they are trying to solve, and like,
don't. If you're a customer of us, don't misunderstand this, but sometimes it's actually beneficial
if we don't immediately react to what you want because it's also a test like sometimes it's it's
help.

00:46:12:10 - 00:46:41:28
Jens
It really helps if someone triggers twice or three times or four times or like how important is this
actually? Like, do you really need this? Or like who needs this? And then then there's this other
problem that, obviously, you know, the product. Like, we know Cosmo best, we know what the
router does. We know the capabilities of the of our control plane, the brain.

00:46:41:28 - 00:47:09:14
Jens
And, it's very often happens that the customer has like a problem, but they, they, they don't see
the, the wider scope and also. Yeah, we have so many customer relationships that we can see
we can see the patterns. We know how everybody deploy something, how they do federation
and we we don't see a problem once we see it like so many times.

00:47:09:14 - 00:47:47:23
Jens
And yeah. So summarizing I like, can you ab test yourself to $1 billion company? I don't know. I
think it depends. I think, I don't know in some regards, like in the short term period, I think it can
be very valuable to, to, to listen and to, to solve these like smaller issues on a, on a broader
scale.

00:47:47:25 - 00:48:31:25
Jens
I think it's, it's, you know, you can't just hire like a product owner who doesn't know anything
about APIs and how people use APIs, and then let them talk to customers, gather the feedback
and A B test to $1 billion company. I saw this in another company, so yeah, you really need to
like this is my role at at WunderGraph is to talk to as many people as I can, to listen to as much
feedback as I can and to, to to set like the, the, the long, the long term.

00:48:31:25 - 00:48:39:07
Jens
Course I think that's, that's a very important thing. And.

00:48:39:09 - 00:48:40:27
Stefan
I think you can build.

00:48:40:29 - 00:48:58:13
Jens
A good company with AB testing even if you're not like if you don't see more in the market. But
yeah, if you if you want to be really successful, then I think it's it's going to be very tough. Like
what what are your thoughts.

00:48:58:15 - 00:49:20:26
Stefan
So it's a good transition because like we're both first time founders. A lot of my friends are first
time founders, but I'm lucky. I also have friends that are repeat founders that have done like
really successful stuff. And what's interesting is nobody ever talks about luck like, oh, you don't
AB tested way to success. Oh, make sure you choose a big market and things like that.

00:49:20:29 - 00:49:42:12
Stefan
But nobody ever actually talks about how important luck is. And so for example slack slack is $1
billion company. It completely changed collaboration like things like that didn't exist before. And
you know how it came to fruition. They were using it internally. They showed a customer it on
accident and they were like, whoa, this is amazing. But they were AB testing a game company.

00:49:42:12 - 00:49:56:23
Stefan
They weren't even using slack. Slack became because it was just an internal tool that they were
using. And so what I mean by that is that, like people will tell you like, oh, you need to pick a
place with a big market, that's where you want to start your company, or you need to pick a
place where you're solving a huge problem.

00:49:56:23 - 00:50:17:22
Stefan
But like Google was two guys from college working on just search for fun, you know, Oracle was
because, Larry Austin didn't want to go start a company. Like, I want to start a software
company. Atlassian was he sent a cold email to his entire graduating class. He's like, who wants
to work on building software together? Another guy was like, me.

00:50:17:22 - 00:50:37:01
Stefan
Sure. And they just started working on software. And then the tools that they built to help
themselves, they kind of were like, like, this is kind of cool. We can sell this. And I don't think
people talk enough about luck and like ab testing. And I think the thing is about first time
founders is you don't think about these things because they're not important.

00:50:37:01 - 00:50:55:25
Stefan
You're just experimenting, you're trying things out. And so for me, I think it's both ways. Like you
can AB way your way to success. It absolutely is possible. But also like repeat founders, they
kind of saw some patterns. They were like, I don't know, maybe I got lucky the first time and I
and I created a market.

00:50:55:25 - 00:51:15:03
Stefan
That's why I was successful. I started in a very niche place, but I created that market. And so for
me, I'm 5050 on it. I also think like I actually Jens taught me this. He was like, all advice is B.S.
he's like one. There's survivorship bias. Like what worked for you might not work for me and
might not work for anybody else.

00:51:15:06 - 00:51:36:15
Stefan
And then two with advice is that it? It's not going to help you. The best way to do it is just go and
experiment. And that's exactly what we did. You remember we were with the SDK, we were
experimenting. We were learning things by some dumb luck. People kept telling us Federation,
federation, federation of federation, perfect timing. We pivoted perfect year.

00:51:36:18 - 00:51:57:02
Stefan
All these customers needed this 100% luck like calls were coming in. And then, you know, we
were always stubborn on the vision, the GitHub for APIs, the way we got there though, which is
also why I think fly and some other companies, sometimes struggle is be stubborn on the vision,
but be flexible on the details of how you get there.

00:51:57:02 - 00:52:10:18
Stefan
And so if you have to way your way to get there, that's okay. But if you need to be just a bullet
train to go through, that's also okay. So my thoughts are honestly, it's like life. You know,
sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
