Stefan
That's fair. So I don't know. We're almost out of time. I want to end with one final question. So if
you were a VC, though, where would you put your bets on? It could be a company. It can be an
industry. But you're a VC. You have a new fund. What three companies would you invest in or
what?

01:06:21:10 - 01:06:22:19
Jens
Three companies.

01:06:22:21 - 01:06:42:00
Stefan
It could be three companies. Three ideas like where would you put your money. So for me, I
would put mine. Number one is that I believe that in the future that all of us will have access to
nuclear power, like just the same way that we have like, power at our house. Imagine that.
There's a little thing that attaches to your house, and your house is powered by nuclear power.

01:06:42:02 - 01:07:10:07
Stefan
I don't know why, but I think that would be an amazing place. It would be cheap, be fantastic,
and it powers the entire house. This is actually funny from David. I'm not biased, but
underground. Very true to collaboration. Monday.com I mean, you'll probably put this one as is
your example too. Monday.com is a full collaboration company and they do 3 billion in ARR 3
billion in IRR, and all they do is help teams just collaborate a little bit.

01:07:10:14 - 01:07:29:23
Stefan
And I don't mean they just help teams like it's pretty useful what they do. And then the second
one is. I don't know what it is, but it's what you said. It's not the people building AI companies,
it's the people building the shovels for the AI company. So for me, Nvidia obviously is going to
be a long term winner.

01:07:29:23 - 01:07:44:27
Stefan
So if I could I put more into Nvidia people building graphics cards, people building chips, people
building to power these AI companies. Those would be my three bets or industries that I would
place my money into. What about you?

01:07:45:00 - 01:08:14:12
Jens
Wow. It's it's a tough question because, I'm not an investor. I'm not thinking day to day about
this, but, I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I would say what bothers me personally, like, I think
my my number one thing that I think it's just, it's just impossible. The biggest thing that that
bothers me is I think we should have more peace in the world.

01:08:14:14 - 01:08:40:17
Jens
Like, throughout, like, I'm now 37 and I don't know why. Maybe it's a media thing, but I get the
feeling that I don't know that that people are are becoming more and more aggressive towards
each other. I don't like it. You if you know me personally, I'm a person that needs harmony. Like
the best way I can like it, really.

01:08:40:17 - 01:08:45:02
Jens
I really struggle when when we have, like, like,

01:08:45:04 - 01:08:46:25
Stefan
Tension between each other or something.

01:08:46:26 - 01:09:13:24
Jens
Yeah. When, when there's tension in the team or something. I it it keeps me awake at night.
This is, this is the, this bothers me. And, I don't know, as a European, this whole situation in, in
the USA, it, it bothers me because for one, I, I want everybody to have, like, free trade and to
cooperate and to work together.

01:09:13:26 - 01:09:21:07
Jens
But I don't know, it's, it seems to me to be very hard for the next couple, couple of years.

01:09:21:09 - 01:09:31:06
Stefan
So a start up that would solve peace. Okay. So that's one. And then what would be the second
or third one, like if you were a VC.

01:09:31:08 - 01:09:36:26
Jens
Startup that solves peace I don't know. Like I'm not sure if anybody wants to invest into this. It's.

01:09:37:02 - 01:09:41:07
Stefan
It's still a good idea. Who knows?

01:09:41:09 - 01:10:05:01
Jens
I think that the next big topic, like, you know, it's not about, like, this doesn't need to make
sense. But I think the next big topic is, we need, we need, clean energy, and we really need to
take care of the planet. I think we're we're we're fucking it up. Unfortunately, and we need to do
something about it.

01:10:05:04 - 01:10:32:18
Jens
Unfortunately, I'm not smart enough. I can I can contribute some API gateways and maybe a
little bit of federation if if that helps. But, yeah, somebody has to figure out, affordable green
energy so that we can we can live a little bit longer here. Third thing, I don't know. I feel.

01:10:32:18 - 01:10:33:19
Stefan
Like I'm.

01:10:33:21 - 01:10:41:21
Jens
Super biased. Obviously, that's. But if we talk about.

01:10:41:23 - 01:11:19:28
Jens
Yes, if we talk about, if we talk about the, the, the future of mankind, I think the the biggest thing
is, you know, this, like, from Andreessen Horowitz, like, our software is eating the world. I
wouldn't say that negatively. I would say the the future of mankind is driven by software, and we
need, I think we the only way we we can build more and better software and solve like, energy
and whatnot.

01:11:20:00 - 01:11:51:22
Jens
I think the foundation for that is we need more software, we need better software, and we need
more people to work in software. I don't believe that magically, boom, AI will write all the
software. You know, you can generate websites with AI, but the moment it gets like super
complex, and the moment you need like 100 people each on each of the 100 people has like
some context window of billions of tokens in their head, and they have some understanding of
the domain.

01:11:51:24 - 01:12:26:23
Jens
I think it just gets like so complex. You need humans. And so for me, it's we need better ways to
build better software. We need better ways to to collaborate on building software. The
foundation for sharing business logic is APIs. And as such, we need better platforms, better
collaborative workflows so that more people can build. Yeah, better things, share them with APIs
and all this kind of thing.

01:12:27:00 - 01:12:52:14
Jens
This is, you know, the like the the foundation of WunderGraph is like our, our north star. It's it's
always like building the GitHub for APIs. And this is really. Yeah helping helping teams, helping
companies to work together to to collaborate. And it's it's what drives us of the three things. Two
I cannot really do anything about it, about it because I'm, I'm not qualified.

01:12:52:15 - 01:12:59:26
Jens
But yeah, maybe we can we can contribute, a layer of API collaboration.

01:12:59:29 - 01:13:20:26
Stefan
Now, what a way to end. I mean, your typical CEO. Avoid the question. Pitch the startup, which
is fair. And then also about the non-qualified. If you guys remember a couple episodes back
Jens was completely unqualified to be an architect, but he did it anyways. So if you have a big
idea, go chase it. If it's something you're passionate about and you really care about it, as we
talked about in this episode, just do it.

01:13:21:00 - 01:13:34:23
Stefan
Because the people that care are the ones that change the world, and the people that can just
go through all the nos. They're the ones that change the world. And the last one I want to add to
that is, is, actually I just blanked. So we'll just end the episode there. But guys.

01:13:34:25 - 01:13:40:12
Jens
I'll go ahead. I have something perfect, you know? You know what the good thing is?

01:13:40:15 - 01:13:40:29
Stefan
What's the good.

01:13:40:29 - 01:13:45:04
Jens
Thing? We're back next week.

01:13:45:07 - 01:13:55:14
Stefan
He's right. So, guys, thanks so much for joining us. We'll be back next week. Same time as
always, 9 a.m.. And let's see what we talk about next week. Thanks Jens.

01:13:55:16 - 01:13:55:27
Stefan
Bye, guys.
