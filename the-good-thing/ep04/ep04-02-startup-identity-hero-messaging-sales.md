Jens
It's actually really hard to come up with a good hero. Like it's insanely hard. And I mean, in our
journey, one one big thing I have observed is that in the very beginning, you know, I still
remember this when I was talking to to to some friends about, starting wundergraph. I still
remember how in the very early days I said, like, I want to build a devtool company, I don't want
to have sales people.

00:03:43:17 - 00:04:36:03
Jens
I just want everybody to self sign up and use the service and whatnot. And like, I don't like
saying like, sales is bad, like sales people are annoying and I really didn't like it. And and
enterprise deals, they they suck and it's annoying and it's awful and procurement go away. And,
so we started wundergraph, like a dev tool company, but I don't know, over the last 2 or 3 years
for me, like a big realization kind of is there are no dev tool startups, at least not those who
survive because if you think about it, do you know any real dev tool company at a series B or
something that's

00:04:36:03 - 00:05:02:01
Jens
actually thriving? Like the only one I would say that comes? Or which dev tool companies do
you actually know who are really successful beyond the series a so they they have like real
revenue. It's it's growing and it's working and they are working towards an IPO or something.
Which dev tool company do you know.

00:05:02:03 - 00:05:20:08
Stefan
I don't so the only two that I can think of which is funny because they're their competitors is
super base and neon. Those are the only two like true dev tool companies I can think of. I don't
know that. Not really. Not really any.

00:05:20:11 - 00:05:23:21
Jens
SuperBase is a bit more like backend as a service, right?

00:05:23:23 - 00:05:52:06
Stefan
Yeah. But like they're starting to pivot because, one of their biggest use cases is hosted
Postgres, which is the same thing that neon does. And people have been preferring to just use
super base. As for one functionality, which is host to Postgres, and that's what they raised their
series C on, if you saw is that they they pivoted from backend as a service to AI hosted
Postgres for your AI apps, and they have some enterprise customers, but those are the only two
companies I can actually think of.

00:05:52:06 - 00:05:57:13
Stefan
And then they fall in the category of databases if they're not even developer tools, anyone.

00:05:57:16 - 00:06:00:26
Jens
What do you think about Vercel?

00:06:00:28 - 00:06:20:29
Stefan
So, Vercel, I don't think it's, like it is a developer tool at the very beginning, but I don't think with
their marketing and everything, now that they are a developer tool anymore, I think that, I mean,
they have 100 million ARR, they're growing like crazy. They raised the series D I, they, I think
they will IPO. But for Vercel.

00:06:21:01 - 00:06:26:24
Stefan
Yeah, I don't see them any more as a developer tool.

00:06:26:26 - 00:06:56:15
Jens
And. Yeah I don't know. So from, from my perspective you can you can start being a dev tool
company. You can think you're a dev tool company. But if you want to build like a successful
startup, that's only one way because think about like just just the other day I saw something like,
I saw a post from from Theo.
