Jens
Sure. That's that's clear. But you might be thinking, okay, if people are successful in enterprise,
will they abandon mid-market? And I have to say, I absolutely love mid-market. So, for example,
our our mid-market pricing, it's it's self-serve. It starts from $500. It's goes, up to 3500 for the
month for like a bigger package. And we, we really love our, our customers in this area.

00:10:39:29 - 00:11:09:05
Jens
They get a decent amount of value. They treat us in a in a very respectful way. We have good
relationships. They give us good feedback. They help us, improve the product. And, yeah, I
really like these these relationships. Enterprise is different. Enterprise in some sense. They have
like different requirements. They, they are more strict in terms of like, security and other other
things.

00:11:09:05 - 00:11:34:12
Jens
And they need like specialized logging and they, they can go crazy on things like Opentelemetry
and Prometheus and all these kind of things, which is totally fine. They pay more. They are
more demanding. But for me, I'm, I, I'm done with like, tiny market. And it's not that I don't like
the people or something. It's it's just, I would say it's it's a matter of preference.

00:11:34:15 - 00:12:04:23
Jens
I personally don't like to build, like, consumer or directly like individual dev facing things. What
where where I found most I would say most fun is when we can enable multiple teams working
together, like the collaborative part. Like, I think building a tool, it's great. And building like
something like, like cosmo router or, you know, query planning all these things.

00:12:04:23 - 00:12:33:10
Jens
It's great. But what really excites me is if we can enable the whole organization to collaborate
better. And it's so often that you see, like teams building silos, teams not not talking to each
other. And, and, all these kind of communication problems, being able to solve this kind of stuff,
helping teams collaborate more things like schema design, all this, this kind of stuff.

00:12:33:12 - 00:12:46:01
Jens
It it actually feels like we're not just selling something, but we're we're really helping them to, to
collaborate better. And, it's fun. Yeah.

00:12:46:04 - 00:12:54:25
Stefan
And like, I would agree, like for those who don't know, know we use have a product called
Cosmo Cloud. And, the pricing started at like $25 a month, and we mean.

00:12:54:26 - 00:12:56:00
Jens
WunderGraph cloud.

00:12:56:03 - 00:13:12:27
Stefan
What did I say? Oh, yeah, I wonder graph cloud. So I WunderGraph Cloud. It was an easy way
to deploy the SDK. And our pricing started at $25 a month. And the customers that we got on
$25 a month, they were abusive. They were yelling at us. They were asking for feature requests,
only paying $25 a month.
