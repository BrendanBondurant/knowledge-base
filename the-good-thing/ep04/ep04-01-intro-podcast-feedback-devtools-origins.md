Stefan
And we're live. Hello, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of The Good Thing, hosted
by me, Stefan and my co-host, Jens. Jens how are you doing today?

00:00:34:12 - 00:00:39:12
Jens
With the words of Sergei. It's okay.

00:00:39:15 - 00:00:45:16
Stefan
For those of you that don't know, Sergei is our one of our founding engineers. Actually, he was
like the first person you recruited, right?

00:00:45:16 - 00:00:47:05
Jens
engineer number one.

00:00:47:07 - 00:00:56:03
Stefan
Yeah, he was engineer number one even before we got the the funding Jens was like, I know
who we're hiring. And I think you hired him right before the money came in.

00:00:56:05 - 00:01:00:15
Jens
Yes. We couldn't afford him. Yet.

00:01:00:18 - 00:01:16:15
Stefan
And then we still hired him. That was crazy. But, Yeah. So, guys, thanks so much for joining us
today. I actually got some feedback from my little sister, and she was like, I like the podcast, but
Stefan, your it's not casual enough. It needs to be more casual like you. And Jens have known
each other for 3 or 4 years.

00:01:16:15 - 00:01:33:16
Stefan
And I was like, you know what? Yeah, that's absolutely right. She's like, you need to be a little bit
more, controversial. And she's like, you need to talk about the things you see in your thing. And I
was like, you know what? It's actually very good feedback. And so today we're going to talk a
little bit different and just going to be meeting me and hanging out drinking some foxy, which is
Dustin's favorite beer.

00:01:33:18 - 00:01:34:10
Stefan
It's actually eating.

00:01:34:13 - 00:01:35:18
Jens
Dont have any

00:01:35:20 - 00:01:49:01
Stefan
I know. But if we could be we could be chilling like at a pub, and we're just going to kind of talk
about what's been going on in, I guess, our lives, what's been going on in the dev tool space
and just kind of things you've seen as a founder, what do you think?

00:01:49:04 - 00:01:52:09
Jens
So we play like, Ricky Gervais.

00:01:52:11 - 00:01:58:23
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. I mean, honestly, he's my favorite comedian. I think you like him too, right?

00:01:58:25 - 00:02:11:22
Jens
I don't actually know him as a comedian. I only know the the when he does the, the moderation
of of the globes and such. And, I don't know, it's it's hilarious. Love him.
Yeah. Where he just ripped up every single celebrity. And then I don't think he was invited back.

00:02:11:24 - 00:02:17:29
Stefan
Right.

00:02:18:01 - 00:02:22:24
Jens
I'm not sure he came, like, four times. I'm not watching this kind of stuff.

00:02:22:24 - 00:02:47:19
Stefan
Just the road. No, that's fair, but, Ricky. Gervais, he's good, he's good. I like him, but one thing
that has been on my mind is, especially with us. So for those of you that know, like, we've been
a dev tool startup from the beginning and recently, we're not a dev tools startup anymore. Jens
what would you call us?

00:02:47:21 - 00:02:48:18
Stefan

00:02:48:21 - 00:03:15:20
Jens
I'm actually currently working on on a next version of our, this morning, I started to be a bit
creative in terms of texting, and I started working a bit on, on, like a new landing page, like a
new hero and everything. And I was thinking about, like, because we were we're slowly
transitioning in from what we where what we're going to be in the future, these kind of things.
