summary: |
  Jens and Stefan discuss the importance of innovation for long-term success, the concept of platform moats, the impact of AI, and why collaboration platforms are so valuable. They analyze examples like Cursor, GitHub, Slack, and Teams, and reflect on what makes a company defensible in the long run.

00:59:01:06 - 00:59:39:12
Jens
Yeah. And you know, this this other thing is if you talk about market size like, what I said earlier,
like market size, it's not everything. But still you want to be in a market that is decently sized at
least where you start, like you want to sell into, a warm market, into a market that's, that's
already it's it's extremely tough to warm up something from, from the get go and, yeah, this is
also something we, we learned in the, in the early days, when, when we were starting out, we,
you know, very technical driven.

00:59:39:12 - 01:00:13:07
Jens
I was like, we are better than Apollo. We do things differently, we do them better. We have a
better approach. And, it's yeah, it's it's not the right thing, but what we what we did then, you
know, in the, in the very beginning we were starting like, okay, we, we build an open source
alternative. So you can say like, okay, it's, it's the same thing, but open source similar to like
super base, open source alternative to, to what was it from from Google.

01:00:13:10 - 01:00:49:29
Jens
firebase. Yeah, exactly. But if you so initially just open source and look at what we're doing
today. Cache warmer, EDFs. We allow you to, to to to bring together federation with event
driven architecture. Then we, we have yeah. I don't know so many other things where we,
where weâ€™re different now. I yeah, we're, we're different now and

01:00:50:02 - 01:01:14:19
Jens
Yeah, it's hard to say, but, ideally you can somehow start riding a wave. Someone else has
created. But to really be successful, eventually you also need to create your own wave, which
we're going to be doing, at some point.

01:01:14:19 - 01:01:40:18
Stefan
But yeah. Yeah, I would say that like there's two approaches you can enter into a market like,
Qualcomm, you can enter into like the CRM market and like that Salesforce created and you
can make great money there. Absolutely. You can be a very successful company. But eventually,
if you want to be the best, you either have to own the entire market or you have to create your
own market.

01:01:40:18 - 01:02:02:14
Stefan
And the only way you can do that is through innovation. So every company, if they want to
become that billion dollar company, they do have to innovate. You can't get there without, you
know, by riding just a wave up there. And like for example, you brought it up today. Cursor.
Cursor is the fastest company in history to go from 0 to 100 million ARR.

01:02:02:16 - 01:02:24:26
Stefan
They didn't innovate anything, which is crazy to me. All they did was forked VSCode, added API
AI capabilities to it, and now they're the fastest company to 0 to 100 million ARR. But doesn't
that kind of break the point of like, innovation though? Like, am I contradicting myself? Like, did
they innovate by adding AI to it, or did they just see something that the market wanted them?

01:02:24:26 - 01:02:31:02
Stefan
Or like, hey, we can we can do this. They are such an interesting example.

01:02:31:05 - 01:03:24:21
Jens
I think from an investor perspective, cursor is super dangerous. It's like, what's the moat?
Because I also have like GitHub, I have GitHub Copilot and and we can now talk about the
nuances of what, what can Curser do and what can copilot do and what can other solutions do
and that I don't know, for, for me, when I see crazy fast growth, there's always also some sort of
danger involved in the sense that, you know, if you look at the startup and they go from, from 0
to 100 million ARR, in one year, you can only innovate so much in one year.

01:03:24:23 - 01:03:56:27
Jens
Right? So how much moat was created? Because look at for example, like the long term view of
slack because like one, one like for me one fundamental thing is like, I believe the big winners in
AI will be people will be companies who built platforms that are not AI. So for me, one of the
biggest winners in the AI game is, for example, GitHub.

01:03:57:01 - 01:04:27:20
Jens
Because GitHub has something you can't use AI to bring, I don't know, 100 million developers
onto a platform. You can't cheat this. And but if you have a distribution, if you have network, if
you have all these companies have like GitHub organizations like that is like, like like a real
moat. And now imagine, there's like a new startup and they do something like cursor or whatnot.

01:04:27:22 - 01:04:56:25
Jens
And then you take GitHub and they, they copy that. Who will win the long term and look at Slack
and Slack versus teams and yeah, just just Google slack versus teams. Click on on the like.
Click on one of the graphs and you will realize that, the ARR of slack, it's a rounding error for, for
teams because long term like slack is great.

01:04:56:25 - 01:05:27:26
Jens
Like we use slack. We like it. We we hate teams. But distribution is what what what matters.
Long term. And so I don't know in terms of. Yeah. Cursor I'm, I'm not sure I, if I was the VC, I
wouldn't bet on these short term trends. I would bet on like who's who's building the platforms.
Because if you have the platform, you can sell cursors any day.

01:05:27:26 - 01:05:55:04
Jens
And so yeah, but but maybe I'm just super stupid and I, I, I don't know much about, AI but, I'm,
I'm thinking a lot in terms of platforms and collaboration and to be honest, well, for me, the most
exciting thing is to to bring people together. I think if you can build a workflow that enables
people to work together, this is it's something sticky.

01:05:55:04 - 01:06:02:23
Jens
It's something valuable, and we can add AI to that or we we don't do it, but yeah.
