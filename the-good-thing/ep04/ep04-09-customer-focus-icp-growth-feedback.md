Jens
Like the fly had so many outages somehow, I don't know, they just couldn't figure out how to do
it. But we we would have been able to forgive them. However, one where I think one of the, one
of the biggest problems we had with fly is, we.

00:25:51:24 - 00:26:20:05
Stefan
Thought.

00:26:20:05 - 00:26:22:27
Jens
Fly would stabilize and and,

00:26:23:00 - 00:26:24:21
Stefan
Yeah, it's a great it.

00:26:24:24 - 00:27:02:23
Jens
Would be great. But the problem is, for whatever reason, fly wants to be something like Vercel.
Fly wants to be something that is like for individual developers. They are not really targeting us.
And we were never able to talk to the to the founders or anything. And it always seemed like
people who tried to build a platform on top of fly like, not deploy an app, but actually built a
platform for other developers on top of fly machines.

00:27:02:25 - 00:27:24:26
Jens
It always felt like we are not their ICP, they they don't care. And this showed in various things.
They didn't talk to us, they didn't really care about our feedback. We could go to the forum. But
yeah, it's it's not the same thing. And then fly machines in the early days. I'm not sure if they
changed it today, but it didn't really have, like an open API spec or something.

00:27:24:26 - 00:27:46:18
Jens
So, sometimes you were hit by surprises when they, when they changed the behavior of the API
or, or like in general. I just recently talked with someone about this and they said, but the the
statement from fly is if you want to use machines, the only way to really use it is you need to to
use the fly CLI.

00:27:46:21 - 00:28:07:00
Jens
And to be honest, I'm not going to build an integration where in my app I start a CLI and I talk to
the CLI locally while doing an in-flight API request from my users. Like I'm not starting binaries
to talk to you. So like.

00:28:07:02 - 00:28:15:21
Stefan
I don't know, they didn't listen. They didn't listen. And you know what annoys us the most or me?
we had one of the highest support tiers, right? In the early days.

00:28:15:24 - 00:28:25:16
Jens
We like the though in the very beginning there were no support tiers. And then there was
something and we we paid for it. But still it was like, I don't know, support.

00:28:25:16 - 00:28:27:14
Stefan
Like they just.

00:28:27:17 - 00:28:44:19
Jens
Didn't want to help us or talk to us or like sometimes we had outages for like two days. They
didn't really answer like, I don't know, we I, I really, really wanted to use it, but yeah. And they,
they didn't care enough about us.

00:28:44:21 - 00:29:02:26
Stefan
And we see this a lot though. Like like I have a friend. He started a company, which was they do
medical staffing, so they're basically a marketplace. And if you're a nurse and you need to find a
shift, you can go and look on this app and then you can find maybe a shift here at the hospital
next to you.
