Stefan
And then the craziest one was, we had like a small outage because we were relying on fly and a
$25 a month customer hopped on a call with us and was demanding that, we need to refund
them the whole year. Because you remember they said they had an SLA and we were like, it's a
$25 plan.

00:13:29:21 - 00:13:54:02
Stefan
You can't have an SLA on a $25 plan. You can on one of our more premium packages. But
that's that's not how it is. And what I found is it's actually harder, much harder to sell a cheaper
product than it is a more expensive product. The more expensive product, it's actually easier to
sell than a more cheaper product, because the type of people that you're dealing with and it's
actually kind of funny, there's always a meme where it's like $5 client.

00:13:54:02 - 00:14:14:07
Stefan
It's like, can we can we hedge against some risk? Can we have a 30 day money day policy?
And then it's like $300,000 client where do I sign? No problem. And so I mean it's crazy. And I
also feel the exact same way. Like if you're building a VC backed like dev tools company, you
have to go into enterprise.

00:14:14:10 - 00:14:39:23
Stefan
If you look at every successful dev tool company or enterprise software company, they make
their money from enterprise enterprise is. The end goal, which is why there's things like Soc2.
That's why there's things like compliance, because you start as a startup, and the end goal is to
get into the big companies, because that's where the money is. And I don't see a way a dev tool
company can do that without ever, ever actually going into enterprise, even super base.

00:14:39:26 - 00:14:57:19
Stefan
They're trying to go into enterprise. They have Google using their tooling to spin up MVP's and
things like that. But hey, at least they're in an enterprise. And so I don't know if you have any
more thoughts on that is like Jens, it's weird to me that people would build a dev tool company
without the angle of trying to go into enterprise.

00:14:57:21 - 00:15:24:21
Jens
I would slightly rephrase it because you don't go into enterprise because there is more money. I
would say because you can't just sell an empty box for for a lot of money. But actually you go
into enterprise because you can bring more value to them and it's a it's a very simple thing. The
the amount of value you can bring to a single developer.

00:15:24:28 - 00:15:49:26
Jens
It's just completely different compared to we're building a solution that enables 100 people to
accomplish a goal together. It's just you have so much more leverage in creating value, which
then this value translates to what you can charge for that. So because like we were, you know,
we were we're not like it's not like, robbing a bank or something.

00:15:50:00 - 00:16:17:05
Jens
You can't. Yeah. You need to bring value and, and, I think I'm one very big I mean, in retrospect,
it's it's so obvious. But, if you build a, you know, like, super simple startup advice, if you don't,
don't do it like us. Do it like smart people. Build anything. It really doesn't matter what you do in
the beginning.
