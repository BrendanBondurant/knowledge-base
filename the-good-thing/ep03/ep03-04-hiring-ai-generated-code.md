summary: 'Stefan and Dustin discuss hiring practices, particularly around AI-generated
  code in applications. Dustin emphasizes that he doesn''t care if candidates use
  AI as long as they understand the code and can explain their thought process. They
  discuss what makes a good hire: passion, open mindset, willingness to learn, and
  domain expertise.'

Stefan
Yeah. It's a fair point. And then, so right now we're hiring like crazy, and Dustin's doing a lot of
interviews and, he's like the first quality control gate for technical people. Have you noticed, like,
since the introduction of AI and like, open AI, have you noticed that, like, there's some AI
generated code in the applications, maybe care like some hallucinations and then you catch it
on the interview or like, has it just been like the same?

00:13:53:18 - 00:14:19:12
Dustin
Honestly, I do not really care if someone use AI if they're able to achieve the end result. I mean,
we will always have a peer review meeting where we discuss the code, where I wish he should
explain his thought process, why? Why he did this and that. And, if he used some AI to to speed
up his workflow, why not?

00:14:19:15 - 00:14:33:06
Dustin
Assuming he understands what he did, and, Yeah, I mean, it wouldn't it wouldn't be fair. I mean,
I use AI every day, all our developers use every day. And why not using it as an exercise?

00:14:33:09 - 00:14:51:02
Stefan
I think it's fair. Like it's weird. Some companies like that, my friends are out there, like, No, AI like
you can use ChatGPT for, like, stuff like that, but no AI in the code base and then other ones,
which is crazy. They made every developer use cursor because they're like it's going to increase
productivity. And I was like, I don't know if that's true.

00:14:51:02 - 00:15:12:11
Stefan
So I don't know this whole AI thing. And like with developers, it's interesting. And then I asked
Jens this question last week, but yes. Explained to us like what we're looking for. Like we're
pretty well aligned on the core values of the graph that we're looking for in new hires. But like
from a CTO point of view, what is like what do you want a new hire to do when they come into
wundergraph?

00:15:12:11 - 00:15:23:02
Stefan
Are they more like they they pass a technical bar, but what kind of attitude are you looking for?
Like what would make a good person to join us? And like, what do you look for as a CTO?

00:15:23:04 - 00:15:56:04
Dustin
I always looking for for people who are super passionate about what they're doing and they
need to be they need to be open for new things. They're always trying to put things into
question. If something doesn't make sense, people who are not shy to ask questions and, yeah,
I think this, this, this, this, this mindset of of of of,

00:15:56:06 - 00:16:23:01
Dustin
Yeah. This open mindset about about, yeah, this is super important. Other than that, yeah. You
need to be doing you need to be good at at your domain. If it's if it's a platform engineer role or
is it a full stack developer role? But those things, we will probably figure them out, during
interviews, during the exercise, and.

00:16:23:01 - 00:16:34:06
Dustin
But if you're super keen to, to learn new things and your. Yeah, you love what you're doing, I
think this is this is the core principle. Yeah.
