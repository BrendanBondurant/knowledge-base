Stefan
And in your current workflow, the CTO so people think like and this is funny, I'll tell you a funny
story, is, at my last job, we had a CTO and he wasn't technical like like he had some technical
experience, but it was like 20 years ago and he was more into a management role. That's not
the case here.

00:08:50:03 - 00:09:06:08
Stefan
Like you're obviously we're small enough, but you're still very hands on coding, implementing,
helping out with the customers, things like that. Do you use any AI in your workflow? Do you use
cursor? What kind of AI tools do you use?

00:09:06:10 - 00:09:36:22
Dustin
I think nothing super special. I use Copilot daily as an integration in my IDE. We have created,
several ChatGPTs for the company to, for example, to, to write technical documentation in a
specific, format to align on the tone or the style. That helps a lot, because not everyone is is
able to write good technical, technical content, which is absolutely fine.

00:09:36:25 - 00:09:55:02
Dustin
It's super hard to write good documentation. Yeah. And I mean, we already using it, I think in
every meeting to, to translate, to a transcript, our customers sessions and, let's say so.

00:09:55:05 - 00:10:13:13
Stefan
I would agree with that. Like the LLMs, that we use to, like, go through the transcripts and find
the important stuff with customer feedback. I think it's useful when you're using copilot or how
do you use it? You still go and write the code. Or do you like, write like what you want it to be
like? For example, I want a function that does this and then it goes in it.

00:10:13:15 - 00:10:19:26
Stefan
Autocompletes it for you, are you actually writing out the function and you're just hitting tab for it
to complete.

00:10:19:28 - 00:10:46:15
Dustin
And more more the more the more the later part. I think haven't yet utilized that to the fullest, to
the fullest. But, yeah. I think there's absolutely room for improvement in that, to improve my
workflow, but I usually, usually just to complete, code and. Yeah.

00:10:46:17 - 00:11:03:10
Stefan
Yeah, I've been messing around a little bit with cursor, like some side projects. And what I don't
like is sometimes like, like I know what I want to implement in my head, like, say this function.
And then I start writing a little bit of it and cursor goes ahead and jumps and it implements the
whole function, but it's not right.

00:11:03:10 - 00:11:15:23
Stefan
And so then it confuses me. And then like it's still there on the screen. So then as I'm like
implementing it, it's a little bit of annoying. Do you run into the same things kind of like that a
little bit or. I don't know, like sometimes the autocomplete bothers me a little bit.

00:11:15:26 - 00:11:40:09
Dustin
Honestly. I haven't used the cursor yet. I heard heard a lot about it. I didn't use it to write, whole
whole components. I'm more on the on the, on the, on the path or more on the side of complete
my existing code. And not let not, not let anything. write. My whole application to.

00:11:40:11 - 00:11:41:15
Dustin
Yeah.

00:11:41:17 - 00:11:58:06
Stefan
I'd agree with that crazy story though. So my little sister, she's, she's about to be a senior in
college. She's finishing up her junior year. So third year of college. And, for one of her classes,
she had to make a personal blog. And, the teacher was like, hey, you guys can use WordPress.

00:11:58:06 - 00:12:18:05
Stefan
You can use a Wix. You know, those, like, website like that help you like create templates, a
blog. And I was like, hey, if you want to be different, like go get cursor like the free plan, go look
up Next.js. Go look up like, like a content delivery system, like all that stuff. And just download
cursor and just start asking questions.

00:12:18:05 - 00:12:42:23
Stefan
How to build a blog and, using cursor and, like, just asking like, claude questions and things like
that. In a week she built, like a fully functional, like blog with Next.js, and she has no programing
experience. And so, I don't know, I thought that was crazy, that like with AI, she was able to build
a blog like on Next.js without ever having any programing experience.

00:12:42:26 - 00:12:54:13
Stefan
But then like, like, does that make somebody an engineer? Is she an engineer now? It's like she
was able to develop a whole front end application with no programing experience using AI.

00:12:54:16 - 00:13:04:07
Dustin
You know, it would be nice if during that workflow, during the journey, the AI would explain her
what she actually did.

00:13:04:09 - 00:13:12:17
Stefan
So you can prompt it to do that. You can be like, hey, let's make a blog site, but teach me the
steps of what we're doing. Like, what are we actually doing?

00:13:12:19 - 00:13:26:21
Dustin
Then I think then it's, I think, a great learning experience. If not, then it's why not? Why not,
using a blog platform to to to create your. Yeah, your content.
