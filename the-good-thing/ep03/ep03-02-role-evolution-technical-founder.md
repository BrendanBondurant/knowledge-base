summary: Dustin discusses his evolution from tech lead to CTO and co-founder, emphasizing

Stefan
Yeah, that was a good time. And then. So you joined us, and then you have this crazy
experience, which is cool, but, talk to me a little bit about, like, how your role has changed. So
you mentioned that as a founder, no more free time, which is true. But like from you going from
an architect, high graph to CTO and co-founder.

00:05:42:05 - 00:05:46:14
Stefan
But first, you weren't CTO, right? You remember when we were small enough, you were a tech
lead, right?

00:05:46:16 - 00:06:17:09
Dustin
Yeah, I think it was yesterday. I, saw a YouTube video from J Combinator where the discuss, the
the relevance of a technical founder. And you cannot outsource, your startup, idea that you
cannot assume that someone has the same passion like you to implement your, your vision or
at least your poc, that that some, some sort of proofs that your idea fits the market.

00:06:17:12 - 00:06:22:21
Dustin
So, yeah. And like. Yeah, yeah.

00:06:22:24 - 00:06:44:15
Stefan
I was gonna say it helps that we have two really technical co-founders. So you and Jens but to
expand a little bit on that because I see it all the time, I see like Y Combinator non-technical
folks, they're saying, oh like now with cursor and with AI you can just build your MVP. But I
totally disagree. I think if you want to build a tech company, you need a technical person, which
is you and Jens.

00:06:44:18 - 00:07:13:07
Dustin
Yeah. One of the person agree. I think it will shift a little bit in terms of you need to hire people.
You don't have to hire on the mass. You're you're hiring on quality. Because I will will be able to
replace or automate certain things that today I think people that there are people who do a lot
of, repetitive stuff.

00:07:13:09 - 00:07:30:24
Dustin
And I think some sort of some of the things can be replaced by AI. But if it comes to like a
someone who has a, needs to be an expert in a specific domain, yeah, I think that that's not
replaceable, at least not in the in the near future.

00:07:30:27 - 00:07:57:15
Stefan
Yeah, yeah, I would agree. I think AI is going to be helpful. It's going to help with the repetitive
tasks. But if you want to build what we're building. So an extremely technical platform for
technical folks and platform teams, I don't think you can build an MVP with cursor. I really don't
think so, because just looking at the engine code of our router, I don't think AI would be able to
make the decisions that you, Sergey and Jens make.

00:07:57:15 - 00:08:00:01
Stefan
What do you think?

00:08:00:03 - 00:08:24:25
Dustin
I, I think it's all about the people. If you I mean, I mean, I think today I could use a cursor to
maybe automate some sort of things that I have built manually. But again, AI needs an operator.
Like, I need to know what to build. I need to know what what should be the end result and what
is good, what is what is bad.

00:08:24:27 - 00:08:30:12
Dustin
And I think AI or claude or whatever can help me to, to speed up the process.
