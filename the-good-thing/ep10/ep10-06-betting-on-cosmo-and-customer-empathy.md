Bjorn
And wouldn't have also all the people that will join us, in the future just because we're not tied to
a single location. I mean, we're an American company as wundergraph. But since we're able to
attract talent wherever they are, we get a lot more talent and a lot more, capabilities. And we
also can, you know, work a little bit more efficiently than maybe people just hiring on the West
Coast, for example.
00:36:11:11 - 00:36:30:01
Bjorn
However, this all comes at a price. So in the beginning was, let's say contained because most
people were located in Europe, except for you, Stefan. So you were the outpost, our feet in the
ground in the US, which was always our prime market right from the get go. So we knew we
wanted to expand more in the US.
00:36:30:04 - 00:36:52:02
Bjorn
And now that we that we do, it's actually challenging to get, you know, time zones, managed
and range. So between handovers of people, talking to customers, that's a lot more challenging
now. And, I think we're still finding the optimal approach to that. But also from an organizational
perspective, it's kind of tricky if you operate in different markets with different legal frameworks.
00:36:52:09 - 00:37:08:15
Bjorn
That's, for example, where Deel comes in as a partner that we work with in order to hire in some
locations, we do have an, a legal entity in Germany, for example. So that's another different
case. Then we work with contractors, which is another different case. Then we have people
employed directly in the US.
00:37:08:22 - 00:37:31:12
Bjorn
So that's a lot of tools to work with. And it was getting tough for me just handling this
singlehandedly as COO. So I'm super happy that we now have support, on that with, Alex or
head of people and culture. Which is awesome. But this is these are all things that you have to
think about when you consider a fully remote, setup and stuff like shipping hardware and so on.
00:37:31:12 - 00:37:53:27
Bjorn
That's. So you think it's just a nuisance in the beginning, but once you know, you have to ship
more stuff and you find out that actually paying someone to do that for you is incredibly it's
ludicrously expensive. So you want to do it just, you want to do it yourself. Still, it's just work.
And if you're a day just has 24 hours, even if you had the night, it's, you know, sometimes you
just run out of time.
00:37:53:27 - 00:38:13:04
Bjorn
So you have a lot of organizational stuff to cover, and it's okay, let's say, to a size of, oh, 20
people. But then it's about, to get some help with that. But I think we've managed, pretty well.
It's also part of the, the philosophy to stay lean for as long as you can until you've found product
market fit.
00:38:13:06 - 00:38:24:01
Bjorn
If you start scaling up on some organizational stuff like, you know, having someone handle the
hardware, having someone handle HR when you're just six people, what's the point? I mean, it's
the best way to run your company to the ground.
00:38:24:03 - 00:38:36:01
Stefan
Yeah. Well said, Jens? What about from you as CEO? Why remote like? Well, obviously
because we can hire amazing talent, everything like that. But what are some of your thoughts
on the challenges of running a remote company?
00:38:36:03 - 00:39:14:23
Jens
So first I would say on the on the positive side, I really like the diversity we have in the team.
Like we have people from so many different companies, different cultural backgrounds. And, I
really like, I think we have created a culture of people speaking up like everybody has a voice.
There's like, yeah, of course we have some some level of ranking, like someone needs to make
the final call, etc. but, we, we, we really like to, to give people a freedom to have some, some
creativity.
00:39:14:26 - 00:39:38:16
Jens
Like if you bring in smart talent, you can't just give them linear tickets and bucks. They want to
have something exciting to work on. So you need to to mix it a little bit. But at the same time,
what we what we realize is, like many of us, we're we're a bit introverted. We like to focus on
something like being at home and focusing on, like, a very hard task.
00:39:38:19 - 00:40:00:28
Jens
This is typically the the best environment to do it. However, when you get stuck, nobody, nobody
can see that. And it's it's very hard. Like, if you compare it to we're currently in this, in this, big
room here where ten people sit around you, if you get stuck, you're like, hey, I'm stuck. Like,
somebody take a look.
00:40:00:28 - 00:40:23:29
Jens
And the typically takes like five seconds and someone walks to your desk and helps you. So
that's the the the level of iteration is much faster. But then I also heard from from people like,
Jacob, our video guy, saying that he, he kind of believes that his, his pace on the individual
tasks at home would be much faster.
00:40:24:03 - 00:40:44:25
Jens
Yeah. Because he, he likes to communicate so much with the people here because there's, so
many interesting people. And then you want to get to know them and discuss with them. So,
kind of what, what we concluded is that as we, as we scale the company, on the, on the one
side, we, we obviously we want to stay, remote first.
00:40:44:27 - 00:41:09:28
Jens
We don't want to have, like, a primary office or something, because in an office, it can create
like an elite culture where you have the group in the office and you have the group across the
globe. And, it's it doesn't work so well. But what we want to do is, so you often hear the term
retreats, but we kind of like to say, working week or working retreat.
00:41:10:00 - 00:41:30:12
Jens
So where we simply meet, like now for, for one week, we, we work from a single place. And then
also I think once a year we want to have, like, like a real retreat, where we, where we are not
like so many hands on on keyboards, but but more workshops and more more team building
and this kind of stuff.
00:41:30:14 - 00:41:34:14
Jens
But yeah, I think that's my, my current perspective on the topic.
00:41:34:20 - 00:41:41:04
Stefan
Yeah. Was an and Dustin for you talk a little bit about how it's coming. Oh go ahead I'm going to
do the same with it. But okay.
00:41:41:12 - 00:42:16:06
Dustin
I think yeah, I think hiring is also another factor. It becomes even more challenging because
you're not just looking for a developer. You're also looking for someone who is very a very good
communicator, like I have. I have seen developers, great developers, great engineers, but
they're lacking communication skills. And in such an environment where you're sitting in front of
the desk and, you have to be if to communicate, blockers you have to the teach, mentor
universe, in a remote culture, this.
00:42:16:08 - 00:42:26:13
Dustin
Yeah. You you need to be you need to be person for that, second, Hiring and, what is the other
thing?
00:42:26:15 - 00:42:29:09
Stefan
I don't know you. I was going to help you. But you took in.
00:42:29:11 - 00:42:33:06
Dustin
Hiring and, and maybe I will come back later to it.
00:42:33:09 - 00:42:55:02
Stefan
Yeah, maybe. But I wanted to know from you is, So, like, building Cosmo. It's a complicated
stack, and the collaboration is key, but how do you manage? You know, training the juniors,
helping out in the technical development and all doing this? Yeah, it might be easier a little bit in
office, but do you think remote work helps with that?
00:42:55:05 - 00:43:00:05
Stefan
That you're able to space it out specially across the time zones that we have?
00:43:00:08 - 00:43:28:29
Dustin
To be honest, I would say no. It is even more challenging to to build a relationship with, with,
with people on the internet. If you hire people from India, US, Spain, the culture is different. You
have to first learn, the culture differences. And I think this is very challenging and, yeah, but that
it we had no choice.
00:43:29:25 - 00:43:40:21
Dustin
So, yeah. And we were super focused on our end results. And, if you're, if you hired the right
people with the right mindset, I think you can make it. Yeah.
00:43:40:23 - 00:43:41:01
Stefan
Yeah.
00:43:41:07 - 00:43:43:03
Dustin
And so I remember my second point.
00:43:43:10 - 00:43:44:29
Stefan
Oh, okay. We're back to.
