Stefan
And then from there it was just, I guess a snowball effect. And so for me, everything, you know,
you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. And
so now looking backwards, like there's so many things we could have done better, but also like
there's no way we could have known to do them better as first time founders.
00:29:23:29 - 00:29:30:18
Stefan
And when we look back, it's, you know, it's a short history, but it's what Bjorn said. It's an
absolutely rich history.
00:29:30:22 - 00:29:32:23
Jens
What about trucks?
00:29:32:26 - 00:29:51:17
Stefan
Okay. And then so we, we got even a little bit more creative. So the drama is and I'll say for the
podcast, I bought a ticket and a plane ticket and a, hotel room to go to New York to go to
GraphQL, GraphQL summit, not Apollo Summit. GraphQL summit. I thought it was open to
everybody.
00:29:51:19 - 00:30:08:15
Stefan
And, I get this email. It's like, hey, thank you for your interest. I was like, it's not interest. I bought
the ticket. And they go, thank you for your interest to, GraphQL summit, but you cannot come.
And then for the reason it was just left blank. They didn't even tell me why I can't come. And
then I was like, okay.
00:30:08:15 - 00:30:19:22
Stefan
And then I asked Bjorn I was like, hey, did they refund that tickets? Like, yeah, we got the
money back. So I was like, well, that's rude. Like, why can't I go to the what they call GraphQL
summit? And so, you know, we started brainstorming and I got a little petty about it. And I was
like, you know what?
00:30:19:23 - 00:30:36:17
Stefan
Why don't we just hijack that conference too and this is what we call guerilla marketing, which I
think really needs to make a comeback. When companies do this, it's it's really funny. And so
what we did is we rented for three days, LED trucks for the first day and the last day they were
parked right in front of the conference, and they would turn on at 8 a.m..
00:30:36:17 - 00:30:54:18
Stefan
And so when people were walking to the conference, they would see it. We luckily got a spot
because, we paid the truck driver a little earlier, a little money to go a little, earlier. So he went at
5 a.m. and held a spot from 5 a.m. till, 7 p.m. and we would bring him lunch and he would just
sit there with the truck, and people were walking by.
00:30:54:18 - 00:31:13:03
Stefan
They were taking pictures with the truck. Apollo wasn’t very happy, but not what you can do. And
then they had an after party on the next day. And, I don't know how I secured this parking spot,
but right in front of the entrance to go to the bar that they were celebrating at, that also was
great because, this was kind of in October.
00:31:13:03 - 00:31:29:11
Stefan
So it got a little bit darker earlier. 6 p.m. was the party. And then all of a sudden, 601, these
bright lights about Cosmo turn up right in front of the venue and to get into the venue, into, like,
where the venue is and where the truck was, is maybe five feet or, like, not even like a meter.
00:31:29:11 - 00:31:50:28
Stefan
And so you absolutely see that that truck. And so we did that. And then we also hired a guy to
just hand out fliers and the impact was I mean, they announced some exciting stuff for their end
and they got a couple impressions. But our trucks got thousands of impressions. And, you know,
it's fun. It's good banter and, you know, if it's if it's called the GraphQL summit, you might as well
let everybody go.
00:31:50:28 - 00:31:59:00
Stefan
It did more harm than good. But yeah, it's been a journey. Those are some of the challenges.
But what about you Björn? What are some of the lessons or challenges from your end?
00:31:59:02 - 00:32:17:12
Bjorn
So just wanted to comment real quick on, our marketing stunts. I think what really, makes a
difference if you're a startup and you really care well, the startup, when you're a founder or you
know you belong to the staff and you really care, is that you do exceptional stuff that people
don't expect, and you're very creative.
00:32:17:12 - 00:32:36:11
Bjorn
So I think one of the the things that make us mighty is that we've got a lot of fresh ideas and a
team, to make them happen, which is awesome. So, like, you can't direct people to do
something like that. It's, you know, the creativity that come just comes up and say, let's do this
spacesuit thing. Let's do the fed pretzels.
00:32:36:14 - 00:33:07:10
Bjorn
And I hope we can retain this. It would be one of the challenges that we can retain that spirit for
as long as we can, because once it becomes like a corporate operation, it's it's not going to be
original anymore. You know, it's not going to be, something that you can really touch. And I think
also one thing that sets us apart from other companies is that we really we are, a way more
professional company now that we were in 2023, but we still try to retain the hunger and the
focus on the customer and to do the things that really move the needle.
00:33:07:13 - 00:33:27:19
Bjorn
And, this, I hope, will be our DNA for here on out. I mean, no matter how how big wundergraph
gets eventually. Because the people that benefit the most from that are the customers. If people
really care and they're are creative and they don't get, you know, lazy and over satisfied with
stuff, it's going to be a great outlook going forward for everyone.
00:33:27:22 - 00:33:45:08
Bjorn
So one of the key challenges was, seeing that you as the, the challenger in the market, get kind
of, bullied aside by the incumbent, let's put it that way. So it's like we take it as banter. That's
totally fine. And I think there's there's no harm done. We're professionals. Everybody should be
cool about it.
00:33:45:08 - 00:34:01:19
Bjorn
But it's really hard if you enter a market that's basically dominated by a single player and you
have to make your your voice heard, it's like Jens said, apollo is very loud, so you have to do
something. You can scream as loud, but you have to be creative in terms. And we didn't know if
that would work.
00:34:01:19 - 00:34:12:00
Bjorn
So we, started. I think it was everybody liked us at, at the conference. I mean, I just recall those
four apollo people turning up front of the booth.
00:34:12:02 - 00:34:12:27
Stefan
And trying to intimidate us.
00:34:13:03 - 00:34:44:21
Bjorn
Yeah, but I think nobody really any of them, like, took us seriously back then. It's different now.
So if one thing an advice maybe for in large players in the market, if you think you need to
suppress or, distract your competition, even if it's, you know, a lot, a lot smaller than you, by just,
you know, excluding them from events that are meant for the entire community, it's actually a
signal, that this challenge is much stronger than you want to make it appear.
00:34:44:29 - 00:35:02:19
Bjorn
So this is where we took a lot of motivation from because we saw that reaction and, we knew
we were on to something also thanks to our customers. And this just gave us more drive, more
energy, going forward. And now looking back at the time, I think now the, the, the scales have
tipped a little bit.
00:35:02:19 - 00:35:19:27
Bjorn
We're still the challenger. Apollo. Still, is the incumbent. But, a lot of things have changed. We're
gaining market share. We're traction. We gained traction. We've got a really competitive
products, and there are so much more to come. This year is going to be super interesting.
00:35:19:29 - 00:35:26:03
Stefan
Yeah. Well, said, I mean, keep the mic because I think this goes to you, but, we're here in
Bretten, we're on the working retreat.
00:35:26:03 - 00:35:29:08
Stefan
talk to us a little bit about the realities of remote work as COO.
00:35:29:14 - 00:35:47:28
Bjorn
So for remote work, I think it's great because you can attract talent. Wherever talent is, so we're
not bound to a single geographic location. Like if we were just recruiting in the vicinity of our
office or wherever that might be, we would be so limited. And I'm super proud and honored to
work with so many fine people here.
