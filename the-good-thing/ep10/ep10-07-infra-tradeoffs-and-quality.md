Dustin
What was, it was like, I think if you would have an office, it is pretty easy to have a bird view on
your team. Right? If you want to establish that in a company, in a remote company, you have to
figure out the right tools. What tools to your do you want to use to to have this almost near
workplace, environment.
00:44:08:22 - 00:44:33:07
Dustin
Yeah, right. We use linear like very innovative towards, were not using Jira. We use linear. We
use slack for customer support. I mean, you can tell more about that. Yeah. And, I think this also
important that you use the right tools to embrace this, this culture that fits almost like I want to
talk to my my friends next to me.
00:44:33:09 - 00:44:34:01
Dustin
Yeah.
00:44:34:04 - 00:44:52:28
Stefan
There was an one thing that I would add on the remote work is, you guys might not know this,
but, Bjorn has three kids, all under ten. Jens has three kids under ten. Dustin is married and I
am married. And the benefits about remote work is so so, so for the ladies. So for the ladies.
00:44:52:28 - 00:45:11:16
Stefan
Sorry. Like we my wife, you know, nothing. But, the benefits of remote work is, it's really
important family. Because, I mean, what's the point of building $1 billion company if you do it
alone? You know? And the cool thing about having three other co-founders is you get advice.
You also get to build that bond with each other.
00:45:11:16 - 00:45:29:20
Stefan
But also we're really focused on giving people the freedom to come to work and work on what
they love to do and with remote work. You allow them to have a life. There is no, you know,
commute to the office. There is no boring like, I have to come into the office and work. And so
this hybrid approach that we have, I think it works best because you have your life.
00:45:29:27 - 00:45:48:13
Stefan
You work on wundergraph where hopefully a significant but small part of your life, and then you
have these working retreats where you come in for a whole week. You're just with the team and
it's it's what Jacob and Jens said. Like it might not be the most productive week product wise,
but for culture and for the roadmap, it's the most productive week.
00:45:48:19 - 00:46:08:28
Stefan
You get rid of zoom fatigue, you come back and the whole team has this camaraderie. And like
my coach, I would just call rah rah. So yeah, rah rah. And then you're just excited to just go
back. And I think that's one of the benefits. And so we're nearing a little bit on time. What I want
to talk about now is it's interesting and it's going to be fun because I have three Germans with
me and they're very direct.
00:46:08:28 - 00:46:15:18
Stefan
So what do you love and what do you hate about wundergraph. And I'll start with you, Bjorn.
00:46:15:20 - 00:46:36:27
Bjorn
Just wanted to add one more comment about the family thing. What's super challenging if you
have a family and if you work at home because you're physically there, but you were maybe
mentally elsewhere, like talking to your, to your colleagues. So it's it's a challenge to keep these
worlds separated when they need to be separated. Even though you can take a lot of advantage
of being you're right there.
00:46:36:27 - 00:46:57:10
Bjorn
So you can do stuff. And, it's also tricky to find people who understand the balance. So, I mean,
we're kind of at the forefront of these things. We understand how hard it is sometimes, and we
wouldn't be here if it wouldn't be for our wives, you know, holding holding the fort sometimes
back home, like hearing this, the kids screaming downstairs and like, fuck, that sounds like a
war.
00:46:57:10 - 00:47:19:20
Bjorn
So you feel like you're on vacation sitting in front of your computer, just having a civilized talk.
And downstairs it's mayhem. So it's hard. And it's not just it doesn't require us to be compatible.
It also requires the rest of the family to be compatible and understanding. And it's it's tough. You
know, if you're just left for the office in the morning and returned at 7:00, different story.
00:47:19:23 - 00:47:37:12
Bjorn
And, also what's important when when you work in a remote company, you need to be able to
travel. That also has become, one of the critical things to discuss, during the hiring process. For
example, if you can't travel and can't meet the people you're working with every day, you're not
made for remote work. Simple statement.
00:47:37:14 - 00:47:37:17
Stefan
I like it.
00:47:37:17 - 00:48:08:29
Bjorn
. So what we what we love and what we hate about wundergraph. I love the company. It's kind
of it's, the thing I always wanted to do, like, build a company from the ground up. Don't repeat
the mistakes I've seen so many years over, in different companies in the past. So to me, it's one
opportunity to make up for, you know, all the hardship that I had to sometimes go through as a,
you know, mid-level manager being right in the sandwich position or just being, you know, a
project manager at the beginning of my career.
00:48:09:01 - 00:48:26:15
Bjorn
You learn so much, during a time and once you get the chance. And this is really the one in a
lifetime thing, to make a difference, to actually make a difference and build a different company
culture. That's absolutely what I always wanted to do. And what I really love about
WunderGraph, I love that we don't know everything.
00:48:26:22 - 00:48:47:10
Bjorn
So we, we don't claim to, you know, be the, ultimate, wise people in the room. We have a lot to
figure out, and we're honest about it. Like, we're like, we're not claiming to be, like, super smart.
And we are know it alsl, we also make mistakes and we work with these make mistakes
because there's a culture of, you know, if you fuck up, you can beep me out on that later.
00:48:47:10 - 00:49:07:11
Bjorn
Jacob. So if you fuck up, we can talk about it and learn from it. I think this is super critical. That's
what I love. What I sometimes struggle with is, friction in a remote company. Yeah. Because if
you have conflicts and conflicts are human nature, so there are conflicts. It's so easy to
misunderstand each other on slack.
00:49:07:14 - 00:49:29:12
Bjorn
On a call just by writing, you know, short message. Even if one of our principles is, always
expect best intent or assume best intent. It's not easy. So to to prevent friction sometimes just
doesn't work. And it's great when we meet because that's, you know, those things usually don't
happen when we meet. But if you don't, it's hard.
00:49:29:12 - 00:49:51:29
Bjorn
And sometimes that's taking a lot of energy when you actually just want to focus on work. And I
think a lot of people, would feel that way. And, sometimes it lacks the, the feeling of, you know,
being the real team in a room. I mean, we're still the same team, but it's different. Like having
everybody here doing a cool hackathon kind of exercise, you know, everything is the hurrah,
spirit.
00:49:52:06 - 00:50:02:21
Bjorn
You know, we all go for the same goal, and we have something to ship, and everybody's
excited, and there's so much energy in the room. Sometimes this doesn't transpire. Through
Zoom or Slack or something like that.
00:50:02:26 - 00:50:08:00
Stefan
Yeah well said.
00:50:08:02 - 00:50:14:09
Jens
Okay. Love and hate for first one thing on the on the family part, you know.
00:50:14:10 - 00:50:15:10
Stefan
Coming back.
00:50:15:13 - 00:50:28:06
Jens
Family. Family is important. Everybody has a family. And we also want to hire people that have a
family, because we we we like having a family. Like, we think it's a good thing.
00:50:28:08 - 00:50:29:26
Stefan
The good thing.
00:50:30:01 - 00:50:31:01
Jens
At the same time,
