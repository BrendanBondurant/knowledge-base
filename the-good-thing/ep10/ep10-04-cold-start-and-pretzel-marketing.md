00:22:37:11 - 00:22:40:03
Stefan
Yeah. Well said. Okay.
00:22:40:05 - 00:23:15:01
Jens
And just to add one thing because, like, I'm a tech founder, Dustin also technical founder, and
another piece of advice is technical founders love to build software. And, I think what we should
have done much, much more in the past and we now have completely changed, like if, if for like
this. Stefan is joking about this, but I personally have completely transitioned from thinking in in
tech and thinking much more in business.
00:23:15:04 - 00:23:47:04
Jens
And so I think what we should have done much more in the beginning, beginning is not think
about, okay, how do we build the SDK, but rather who would actually buy it. How how would the
market look like, how do we sell it, etc.. And then there's one one other aspect, in, in the, in the
early days where, where I also want to share some insights because, Cosmo had, had an
extreme cold start, like in the beginning, it was extremely hard to actually get to get customers
and to get market share.
00:23:47:06 - 00:24:18:26
Jens
And one thing you should absolutely not underestimate is, it was so hard to get the word out
and to, to actually be seen from people who were, using Apollo and like, if you, if you have a, an
incumbent like Apollo with 100 million in funding, they are very loud and they are everywhere.
And they, they have marketing, they go to conferences and just by, you know, the the old saying
like build something and they will come, it's not enough.
00:24:18:26 - 00:24:45:24
Jens
And you have to be like really creative in, in, in ways to be to be seen by, by people. And
sometimes this can be, this can be funny. Sometimes this can be, informative. But, maybe
Stefan wants to talk a bit about, the funny episode of, how wundergraph got some, some, love
and attention.
00:24:45:27 - 00:25:01:11
Stefan
Yeah, that's an interesting one. I mean, like, first, like, with the challenges, like, one of my
favorite quotes is, like, everybody has, a plan until youget punched in the face, and that's what
we did. We had a plan for the SDK. We had a plan for cloud, and then we got punched in the
face by reality. And Jens is absolutely right.
00:25:01:11 - 00:25:18:23
Stefan
Like when we transitioned, it wasn't like, oh, we built it. And like oooo Everybody's coming.
Luckily, from those conversations with that notebook, we we kept in touch with these people.
And in three weeks we were able to get the first customer. But they had an extremely simple
use case. It was so simple you couldn't get much feedback out of that customer.
00:25:18:23 - 00:25:37:00
Stefan
They're great. They're still a customer. But what Cosmo is now at at the enterprise scale, it's
only possible because of how we got attention. And you have to be creative. you really do. And
so the first thing is we said, you know what? We're going to go all in. This was in July of 23. And
we said in September, right, we're going to go to GraphQL conf.
00:25:37:00 - 00:25:55:07
Stefan
The first GraphQL conf. And we got a booth. We were burning runway. The booth was
expensive. But you said, you know what, we're going to risk it. And we thought, how are we
going to hijack this? You know, we're competing against people that paid $75,000 to be there.
They have keynotes. We have a single talk at 5 p.m. with just Jens. the last day
00:25:55:07 - 00:26:11:08
Stefan
And so, yeah, the last day, like, you know, like all the odds are against you. And so we started
brainstorming and the first thing we did is first we need to draw attention. So Stefan is going to
wear a spacesuit. So I wear an orange spacesuit. We call him the cosmonaut. And I had a
helmet. And so that was step one.
00:26:11:08 - 00:26:28:12
Stefan
Step two was you have to be creative with your money. Conferences can be a little bit tricky
about bringing things in. We got really creative with it. And so we were able to sneak a TV in that
we bought in the United States and then returned to Walmart. Hopefully Walmart's not watching,
but we bought and rented a TV for three days.
00:26:28:12 - 00:26:49:27
Stefan
We bought a, an easel to hold the TV. We bought all the electrical wiring and everything, or else
we'd have to rent it to the conference for, like, how much was it? Like 25,000. Some ridiculous
amount of money. And so we got creative there and we just said, oh, yeah, we just brought our
own equipment. The third one thing that we did this was Bjorn's idea was, I mean, we have
German roots, and I mean, we've been eating pretzels the whole time while we're here in
Bretten.
00:26:49:27 - 00:27:07:21
Stefan
Like, just from the bakery. And we were like, why don't we bake pretzels in the shape of the
GraphQL logo? And, you know, I went I started looking on the internet and I found 25 bakeries, I
called 25 of them and 24 of them were like, no, what? No, we can't do that. But this other one
was like, you know what, let me try it over the weekend.
00:27:07:21 - 00:27:24:17
Stefan
I'll let you know. I sent him a picture of and he made it. And he's like, how many do you need? I
was like, I need 500 a day. He's like, Holy crap. Okay. And so it was 500. It was like 200 or
something. It was like 200, I think. Still a lot of pretzels. And the thing is, we were in San
Francisco, close to the airport, and they're in Berkeley.
00:27:24:17 - 00:27:41:09
Stefan
And I'm like, oh, that's close. No, it's like 45 minutes. And so in the morning I'd leave at 6 a.m.,
go pick up these hot pretzels, and I'm driving back and my mouth is watering because there's
these hot pretzels in the back. And, yeah, we had to pay the hotel a little bit of money to allow us
to bring our own food, but it was a hit.
00:27:41:09 - 00:27:55:13
Stefan
People were coming over to the booth. They were like, Holy crap, this is who made this? We
were like, I baked them, please sign up for my company. But we were joking with them. And
then that worked and people remembered us like they posted it on Twitter. They posted on
social media, they were like, wow, check out these pretzels.
00:27:55:16 - 00:28:14:25
Stefan
And then the last one was the which one. Oh oh. Okay, so I forgot about that one on the TV. We
didn't put anything about Cosmo. We just put Mario Kart and we just told people, come eat a
pretzel and play some Mario Kart with us. It was just totally out of the box. And so these
engineers, you know, principle engineers at big companies were just coming and playing Mario
Kart, like you're playing with them.
00:28:14:25 - 00:28:28:01
Stefan
You're just like, so like, what are you using for Federation? You know, and it was really creative.
But then the last one, I think this was kind of funny is that. Jens, this talk was at the very end,
what did you call it, the graveyard shift or something? You had a word for it. Oh, you Björn ?
00:28:28:01 - 00:28:29:10
Stefan
It works like this.
00:28:29:12 - 00:28:31:04
Bjorn
The last in the worst slot you want to be in?
00:28:31:05 - 00:28:48:08
Stefan
Yeah, the graveyard shift. And, so I was a little worried that people wouldn't go in there. And this
is what I call, like, social engineering or just being creative or having some finesse. I took off my
nametag and I just started walking around the conference being like, hey, which talk are you
guys going to now? Oh, I'm going to go to the one about, the data loader 3.0.
00:28:48:09 - 00:29:05:17
Stefan
And by Jens, you know, you know, I don't know yet, but I'm going to go to that one. So I started
funneling people like sheep into Jens booth. And I at that point I don't care. You know, you got to
do what you got to do sometimes. And that conference honestly was a pivotal point because do
you remember the next week we had 35 calls in one week.
