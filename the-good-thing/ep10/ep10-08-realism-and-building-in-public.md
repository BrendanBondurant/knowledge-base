Jens
with your with your family in, in, remote company. Not every day can be the same. And so,
because two of our, founders have, together, like, not be together, but we have six kids already.
We we are very understanding of of what family means. And we have kind of built a, a mindset
where we are very much, results focused, but not exactly hours focused.
00:51:01:28 - 00:51:25:06
Jens
So if if someone works for our company and they have together a kid from kindergarten or
someone is ill, like it happens all the time and they have to to make a break for two hours like
nobody bats an eye. What really matters is that at the end of the month, we're getting our work
done and in every other regard, we're we're, we're we're kind of flexible.
00:51:25:08 - 00:51:52:14
Jens
And then there's also companies, they they say like, hey, your startup is your family or whatnot.
Our mindset is we are like an elite sports team, and every member has their family. Sometimes
it feels a little bit that that founders, are a little bit more than just colleagues because, like, life
and family and being a founder, it blends, into each other.
00:51:52:14 - 00:52:21:08
Jens
Because if if something doesn't work and it's weekend. Yeah, it doesn't work and it's your
company and then somebody has to fix it. So this, this can happen. And then on the, on the,
love and hate part, I think like one of the biggest things I love about wundergraph. So we, we
have super smart people within the company, but we also have super smart company around,
people around the company.
00:52:21:11 - 00:52:48:23
Jens
And so I would say we're super lucky that we work in, in the market where we work with, like,
principal software engineers or senior architects at Uber, Paramount and eBay and other
companies. And these are all like very smart people. We learn a lot. It's it's great to interact.
Like, I'm a self-taught engineer, I, I don't have the curriculum that gets you into a Google.
00:52:48:23 - 00:53:09:21
Jens
But now we work with all these cool companies together. So so that's that's, an amazing thing. I
would say another positive thing is we never had too much funding, so we had to be smart in
how we use it. And I think it kind of forced us to be, I don't know, to, to be very efficient in
everything we're doing.
00:53:09:21 - 00:53:32:28
Jens
So I think that that really helped. The one thing I would say I don't like about WunderGraph,
sometimes I miss the, the, the days where we had an office. I drive there in the morning, I do my
work. And then I stopped doing my work, and I drive home. And that's the day, like, you know,
before, I went into IT, you know, I, I'm a self-taught.
00:53:32:28 - 00:53:57:15
Jens
I, I stumbled into this because of an, accident with the truck. I was a carpenter. And as a
carpenter, you drive to your job, you do a couple of things. You do some some work with
whatever, or you drive to some some, clients, and you repair, something like a door for them or
whatever. And then you drive home and that was it.
00:53:57:15 - 00:54:09:03
Jens
Like, now work stops. And with wundergraph, it never stops. You always have something to do.
And you, you kind of have to set boundaries. Like where work stops and that's really tough.
00:54:09:05 - 00:54:13:10
Stefan
Yeah. Well, said I already know Dustin's.
00:54:13:12 - 00:54:22:08
Dustin
Well, what I love about work, I think it's the whole learning experience. I think we grew so much
altogether in, I don't know, in light, light, speed.
00:54:22:10 - 00:54:23:14
Stefan
Yeah like two and a half years.
00:54:23:17 - 00:54:49:02
Dustin
Two and a half years, I don't remember. Yeah. That's huge. Different from what Stefan was
before. Two years. What Jens was before two years. It's it's amazing. Yeah. And what I hate is a
strong word I would say. Yeah. Hate. I think, it's nobody should underestimate, being a founder.
It's especially in a successful company.
00:54:49:02 - 00:55:13:09
Dustin
It is stressful. Yeah. And, I think also very critical is that you're. I would I would like to just shout
out to our families and to our partners. To wives, I think this is also critical. And, Yeah. To to to
survive such a journey that you have to the right, you have to need the right partner, the right
family and.
