01:01:55:15 - 01:02:07:09
Jens
And so now, I would say we are very, very close and actually bringing it all together. And, yeah,
you you should expect some some big changes in the, in the upcoming months.
01:02:07:11 - 01:02:12:21
Stefan
Well Said from a technical point of view, Dustin and don't reveal too much by the. No, no, no, I.
01:02:12:24 - 01:02:45:14
Dustin
I would like to emphasize a little bit on that. I think we it's funny that we will come back a little bit
to the SDK. Right. So we'll see. So we will no longer be limited by GraphQL itself, but GraphQL
will still be the meta language, the byte code, in our product assembler or assembler to yeah, to
orchestrate to, to be the source of truth of, of the contracts of of how each data source fits
together.
01:02:45:16 - 01:02:56:14
Dustin
And we are then no longer limited by how to expose APIs or how to consume services that.
01:02:56:16 - 01:03:12:05
Stefan
Give it to björn. Because not on vision, not on product, not on tech. A lot of changes are
happening in the company. What does it mean as a COO? I mean, we just hired our first kind of
people. But what's the future of Wonder Graph as a company? Why? I'm little I'm not allowed to
speak on tech.
01:03:12:08 - 01:03:14:13
Stefan
Yeah, you can if you want.
01:03:14:13 - 01:03:19:18
Bjorn
So for us as a company, this now is the growth stage, which means we have to
01:03:19:18 - 01:03:36:00
Bjorn
professionalize or to firm up, processes that currently just exist because, you know, that's the
way we work. So we have to introduce some structure in some areas. Like, for example, we
have to streamline support a little bit in our presence in more markets where our customers are.
01:03:36:07 - 01:03:55:10
Bjorn
So this is the challenge for us as a company is scaling up, and at the same time retaining our
DNA as an engineering company. So yes, we will do something on the sales side. Yes, we will
do something on the marketing side. You will see some fun stuff there in the future as well. But
for us, the focus, will always be the engineering side.
01:03:55:10 - 01:04:18:06
Bjorn
So when you are a customer or some someone working at one of our customers and you want
to talk with us, you will be talking to an engineer who understands your use case and who is
able to help you because people really know that stuff when they communicate with you. And so
to retain this DNA and make sure this still works, and hiring the right people to actually make it
work, this will be the challenge going forward.
01:04:18:09 - 01:04:39:12
Bjorn
And I think as a company, we need to retain the spirit that we discussed earlier. So we need to
stay wundergraph and wundergraph in all our ways without you know, screwing things up too
much, but still delivering the best value, the best products with the most dedicated and the most
engaged team on the market also.
01:04:39:14 - 01:05:05:01
Stefan
And to conclude on that part just from my end, what's the future of wundergraph, For our
customers, it means absolutely nothing, because what we want to do is absolutely keep that
DNA, keep that support, keep that technical engineering DNA within it. And it just means more
use cases and the power of open source. And when you say Apache 2.0 is that you get so much
knowledge from some of the biggest companies in the world, and that's only possible through
open source.
01:05:05:03 - 01:05:21:11
Stefan
And that's why the future of WunderGraph is open source. And with that, this was our 10th
episode of The Good Thing. We started it off in January. As kind of like a joke. We were like, you
know what? Let's just do a podcast. Let's bring in for let's Talk. We've gotten really good, you
know, reviews on it.
01:05:21:11 - 01:05:38:06
Stefan
People have been watching it. And today I just wanted to thank you guys for for joining us on the
10th episode. For us being able to do this live. It's been really a fantastic experience, especially
to do it live for the first time. And then the good thing is what we wouldn't have got three years
ago. One roof.
01:05:38:09 - 01:05:39:02
Bjorn
Basically turn.
01:05:39:03 - 01:05:43:16
Stefan
Three. This is how you know Bjorn doesn't come on the podcast because we end with, the good
thing is, I just wanted to.
01:05:43:16 - 01:05:43:27
Bjorn
Throw it in.
01:05:43:28 - 01:05:50:27
Stefan
Before you and do to my what's the good thing, Stefan? What is the good thing? The good thing
is, Bjorn, we're back next week. Exactly. Thanks, guys.
01:05:50:27 - 01:05:53:27
Stefan
Okay.
