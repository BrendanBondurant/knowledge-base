Bjorn
That's a that's a really great question. I need to be careful about my answer. So what I so what I
like about the team that we are as founders is that we always strategize together. So whenever
you know, something like should we pivot, should we not, you know, what should we do about
the recent development once that comes up, we sit down together and try to figure things out,
ideally in person.
00:16:30:28 - 00:16:52:27
Bjorn
So one of the good things, where back then that we actually met in person in the Netherlands, in
that former sheep den, so we could work together, not just sitting in the hot tub, but working
together on the flip chart. When you explained, based on your notes, what was happening with
the customers to me from a, you know, a little bit outside perspective, it was like, fuck, this is not
what I signed up for.
00:16:52:29 - 00:17:20:04
Bjorn
Dang. this is never going to work because now, in hindsight, it's not that much of a pivot,
actually, because the foundation had already been laid out. It's just a different and a lot smart
application of many of the principles that we had established. But back then it was like, we don't
know where this company is headed. You know, I have to fully trust Jens Stefan, on their hunch
or their insight into the market that they got firsthand, but I didn't.
00:17:20:06 - 00:17:39:26
Bjorn
But I think this is pivotal. So when you work as a founder team, you can't be in in every meeting.
It's impossible. And it's also not very efficient speaking as a German. So we need to split that
responsibility and we need to trust. And Jens happens to have one of the deepest,
understandings that I that probably exists in the GraphQL space.
00:17:39:29 - 00:17:55:29
Bjorn
Dustin know how to build stuff. So if he said it can be done, it can be done. And Stefan is kind of
the first line, between WunderGraph and our customers getting first hand feedback, taking down
the notes. And it was, I think even before the, before ChatGPT kind of started taking notes for
you.
00:17:55:29 - 00:18:16:10
Bjorn
So you had to take it. Everything in your notebook. Yeah. And not ask your notebook, but
actually compile your notes yourself different times, just like two years ago. So I had to trust. But
the good thing is that we already had Spent, over a year together, or one and a half years
running this company, going through highs and lows.
00:18:16:12 - 00:18:35:04
Bjorn
So I had to trust that this was, the right way forward. I didn't have much choice anyway. So all I
could do is, make sure that everything on the legal side or the procurement side would run as
smoothly as, as possible. So this was, a leap of faith. But at the end of the day, it turned out to
be just the right step.
00:18:35:07 - 00:18:44:15
Bjorn
Had I believed that this would actually turn out, this well probably not. But it's always great if you
know your expectations are way outpaced by reality.
00:18:44:17 - 00:18:45:06
Dustin
Yeah.
00:18:45:08 - 00:19:33:23
Jens
one thing I want to add to this is if we talk a bit about the, the, the challenges, the, the mistakes
and, and, what we learned through this, throughout this period. And I will also hand it to, to
Stefan and, Dustin to get your perspective. But for me, I think, like, one one key lesson learned
was we built the SDK, and I remember how we set together in Frankfurt for our first retreat and
we said, okay, we're not getting enough traction on the SDK, but if we build a cloud to allow
people to host the SDK, then more people would use the SDK.
00:19:33:23 - 00:20:00:13
Jens
We were looking at players, like Vercel and we thought, okay, if we just do it like Vercel, who
had, I don't know how many hundreds more, in millions of funding, but we thought, okay, if we
just take a playbook from someone who is successful, we should be able to, to follow them. And
we we kind of said, okay, Vercel has Next.js, so that's like front end.
00:20:00:15 - 00:20:26:18
Jens
And we do, WonderGraph SDK for API's and our cloud and then, billionaires and I think one
super big learning is so what we did in this phase is we, we looked at successful startups and
we tried to imitate them. The problem is you don't have their funding, you don't have their
connections. You might be in a different space.
00:20:26:18 - 00:20:59:10
Jens
And ultimately you're also starting at a different time. So what Vercel started actually like before
it was Vercel. It was like, zeit.co, and I don't know, it took it took Guillermo like so many years to
reach the point where actually something like Vercel works. And so that was, not an overnight
success. So that's one part. And the second part is we scaled the team before we had clear
indication of product market fit.
00:20:59:10 - 00:21:26:23
Jens
And if if I can give one single piece of advice, you need four founders and maybe two, maybe
three, maybe four, but definitely not five engineers to to get to product market fit in if you need
more. Okay. Maybe you're an outlier in some some like hardware space or whatever or you're
building airplanes. But if you're building SaaS, you should be good with a handful of people.
00:21:26:25 - 00:21:39:10
Jens
So, so that's, I would say my, my biggest takeaway here. Anything to add from Dustin? Yeah.
00:21:39:13 - 00:22:04:10
Dustin
We are all, first time founders. I remember the time where we have built the SDK of the cloud. I
think technology, it was very exciting. I and I believe this is one of the pitfalls, if you're if you're
trying to build a product just because of just out of curiosity. So you didn't really evaluate the
market, the needs of what customers really ask for.
00:22:04:13 - 00:22:28:10
Jens
And I think this is this is crucial. I think you should you should have iterate much, much faster.
Building a a POC test the market test with customers and then figure out, hey, I think this is not
something people will buy or will will put their credit cards, on. And, yeah, this is one of one of
the learnings, I think.
00:22:28:13 - 00:22:37:08
Dustin
Yeah. Try yeah. Don't be so, so locked in into technology. Try to solve a problem.
