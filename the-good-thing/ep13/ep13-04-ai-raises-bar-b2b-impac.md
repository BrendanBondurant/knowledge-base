summary: Stefan and Jens discuss how AI is transforming B2B SaaS by raising competitive
  bars and enabling smaller, more powerful teams. They analyze Shopify's mandate requiring
  teams to demonstrate why AI can't accomplish goals before requesting more headcount,
  emphasizing how AI makes small startups and lean teams more dangerous and effective.

00:11:22:06 - 00:11:27:24
Jens
And because I think we're going to see new products with this paradigm
00:11:27:24 - 00:11:49:20
Stefan
And one of the things I was coming up to my mind here is, four and five in the mandate. So
learning is self-directed, but share what you learn. So that's obviously what we're doing at
wunder graph, but everywhere we're experimenting with these tools, we're sharing what works.
We're sharing what doesn't work. But five I think this is going to fundamentally change
companies and software companies selling to other companies.
00:11:49:20 - 00:12:12:13
Stefan
So it's going to change B2B because before asking for more headcount and resources, which
means new tools, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they get, what they want
done with AI. What do you think about that? Do you think it's going to be harder now to be in
B2B SaaS when everyone's using AI? And they could, just, like you said, build it themselves?
00:12:13:07 - 00:12:31:01
Jens
I'm not sure if harder, but I like I said before, it's a paradigm shift. And I think there's, there's now
a lot of applications you don't need anymore because they can just be generated. Another thing
I would say is, it is it right to say it it lifts the tide.
00:12:31:04 - 00:12:35:06
Stefan
It's so yes, it lifts the tide or raises the bar.
00:12:35:09 - 00:12:59:21
Jens
Yeah, it raises the bar. But for everybody. So like, but not for people who don't use it. So I mean,
AI is accessible to everybody. If you're not using cursor today, your competitor is using cursor.
Yeah. And, you need to be careful. Of course, it is not good at everything, but it is good at a lot
of things.
00:12:59:21 - 00:13:36:03
Jens
And, yeah, if you if you're not doing it, that that's, that's a problem. And one thing on the fifth part
before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get
what they want done using AI. You could also remove AI from this, sentence and replace it with
existing resources. Yeah, because to be honest, from a business point of view, you always need
to demonstrate that you that you cannot do something with existing resources.
00:13:36:15 - 00:14:01:27
Jens
So I think it makes sense. And then essentially what, what Toby is saying here, yeah. Before
asking for more people, try to see what you can do with the existing people and leverage AI
more. And to be honest, I like, you know, there's there's complexity in communication when you
add people. So let's say you have a team of eight people.
00:14:01:29 - 00:14:31:07
Jens
And if you if you think you need three more, the complexity of communication between eight
people and 11, it is it is not like, one third more. It is much more complex. And I think what AI
means in this context is you can have you can still have this two pizza team, like 7 to 8 devs, but
with AI they can now do more.
00:14:31:09 - 00:14:46:11
Jens
So they are even more dangerous. They are even more powerful. So, yeah, I think essentially
what what AI does, it's, again, it's making small teams more powerful. It's it's good for small
startups.
