Episode 13
00:00:24:22 - 00:00:33:10
Stefan
And we're live. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing.
I'm joined, as always, by my host, Jens, Jens How are you doing today?
00:00:33:12 - 00:00:38:09
Jens
What's wrong with you? Where's the. Where's the energy? The energy is.
00:00:38:09 - 00:00:42:09
Stefan
Here. What do you mean? I just did my intro. I said, what's up when I'm bringing everybody in?
00:00:42:10 - 00:00:59:08
Jens
But how are you doing? Okay. Yeah, it's. It's good. Sunny day in Germany. It's. It's getting
warmer. kids our starting to to, to play in the garden and, Yeah. It's good.
00:00:59:11 - 00:01:15:13
Stefan
That's awesome. And I'm super excited about today's episode because we're talking about a lot.
I mean, this morning we were just doing a little small demo of what the future is coming to be,
and this week has been crazy for tech. I mean, first we're going to talk about the Toby AI memo,
which is crazy for Shopify. We're going to talk about MCP.
00:01:15:14 - 00:01:31:28
Stefan
We're going to talk about the S and what it stands for. And what I'm really, really excited about is
just kind of like where we're going on the AI direction. And so let's kind of just kick it off. Jens. So
what are you seeing right now in the space, especially around AI?
00:01:34:07 - 00:02:05:03
Jens
So for quite a bit, we had where we were on the, on the path to kind of plateau in what the
models can do. I think the models are now quite good, but we can also see like, yeah, it
currently doesn't look like AGI, but I also think it's not necessarily a bad thing. Because what
we're currently seeing is like an, an integration play coming.
00:02:05:03 - 00:02:30:02
Jens
And, it's something I would say it really excites us because from the very beginning, we were we
were always super interested in helping integrate. And, yeah, I think it's it's just interesting, if we
speak about the elephant in the room, MCP what it means, what it what it does, how it will how it
will change.
00:02:31:17 - 00:03:01:19
Jens
Software development, for example, but also many, many other areas. And, like for me, I'm not
sure if we have this on the, on the, on the roadmap for today's session, but for me, a big topic
would be to talk about, the impact of MCP on, on software development. We just added MCP
support, in a very sophisticated way into, into Cosmo itself, which changes workflows.
00:03:01:19 - 00:03:38:11
Jens
It and just in general, I think one thing I would like to, to show today is, just the impact of MCP
on software development workflows and what I think MCP has, how it will change, the dev tools
space. Because in the past, when you were building dev tools or working with dev tools, it was
always like you, you needed to build, dashboards or whatever and user interfaces to configure
stuff.
00:03:38:11 - 00:04:02:17
Jens
And I think this is rapidly changing with MCP. I have just built a couple of, features into, into
Cosmo, which, from my point of view, it changes how you can structure certain workflows. And,
yeah, I think it's it's exciting and, and, it's a big topic.
