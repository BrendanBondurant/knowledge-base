mentions:
  - Iron Man Jarvis comparison
  - in-memory schema verification
  - schema change proposal workflow
  - age field addition to employee type
  - family service modification
  - MCP tools marketplace concept
  - frontend developer workflow improvement
  - backend approval governance
summary: Jens demonstrates the dream query workflow where AI automatically creates
  schema change proposals. The system successfully adds an age field to the employee
  type in the family service through prompting alone. Stefan envisions how this transforms
  frontend-backend workflows, eliminating the need for manual coordination, while
  maintaining governance through approval processes.

Jens
This is my dream query. Yeah.
00:45:05:07 - 00:45:11:15
Stefan
As a front end developer, that's the information I want to go and get and display to the client
okay okay.
00:45:11:17 - 00:45:39:16
Jens
So we put our dream query, and we say super graph blah blah blah. So this and then we say.
Start the dream query work flow for the following query.
00:45:39:18 - 00:45:46:10
Jens
No way.
00:45:46:13 - 00:45:59:22
Jens
Do you see how hard I'm working? I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm an architect. Like, I'm very busy stefan.
I'm I'm fetching the super graph.
00:45:59:24 - 00:46:05:24
Stefan
This feels like you ever see, Iron Man where he's like, come on, come on, Jarvis, wake up.
Wake up of the Jarvis.
00:46:05:26 - 00:46:15:00
Jens
Yeah, it's literally what it is. Okay, so, we we verify.
00:46:15:02 - 00:46:18:16
Stefan
That's another MCP tool, so you verify it against the in-memory schema. Okay.
Yeah, I, I you see I, I this workflow, it tells AI, it gives AI instructions on how to follow this,
00:46:18:16 - 00:46:30:27
Jens
through.
00:46:30:29 - 00:46:52:06
Stefan
And there's a very cool tool by the way. And what I'm envisioning is so we've had to build these
MCP tools, but in the next iteration of Cosmo, in the next iteration, everything we build, we'll just
have a marketplace of, hey, take this down, do that. Hey, do this. Just basically all these MCP
tools that you could grab and use for yourself as well as create your own.
00:46:52:12 - 00:46:56:28
Stefan
It's pretty amazing.
00:46:57:00 - 00:47:03:12
Stefan
Okay, so now you're fetching the subgraphs.
00:47:03:15 - 00:47:16:15
Stefan
You know that. It's so cool though. And it's also learning for the person to see how it would like
go through and solve the problem. It's very cool.
00:47:16:17 - 00:47:24:19
Stefan
Okay, so now it's calling the schema change proposal workflow. Very cool. And I know what
that's going to fit into eventually, but I'm not going to say it on the podcast.
00:47:24:21 - 00:47:27:19
Jens
00:47:27:21 - 00:47:37:09
Stefan
Very cool, very cool. Okay. Let's prepare the schema change. This is crazy.
00:47:37:12 - 00:48:08:19
Jens
You know? And here's the thing. Like the the cool thing is not like I haven't invented the llm, but
what I just did here in this call, for example. So we made a proposal to prompting. And now what
the alarm did is we're actually making a verification. That's the change we want to do. It's
actually compatible. And I can show you something.
00:48:09:03 - 00:48:33:16
Jens
So it wants to, verify this again. Okay. And, needs to do that. Okay. Remote schema. That won't
work. But I show you something. If we go to our studio, you see here, we want it to do h, right?
We wanted to add this.
00:48:33:18 - 00:48:36:29
Jens
Look at what it did.
00:48:37:01 - 00:48:40:27
Stefan
Yeah. It did what? That's insane. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.
00:48:40:27 - 00:49:01:00
Jens
AI, the llm added the field h to the employee type in the family service I think is it family service?
Here. Family. Yes. And now we can see the schema. The schema is here.
00:49:01:00 - 00:49:03:15
Stefan
Employee ID is age.
00:49:03:18 - 00:49:42:16
Jens
It has details and age. So just by prompting, we have you did a proposal to add the age to the
employee type and I don't know what this is. I think it's very powerful because we just went from
from a query, from our dream query to how we could turn that into and, you know, like, this is not
even, like, don't think too much about this, like advertising, in terms of, hey, Cosmo is cool, blah,
blah, blah.
00:49:42:20 - 00:50:04:01
Jens
It's not about that's not why I'm showing it. I'm showing it more like, think about your existing
tools. And if you expose the right things to MCP, this is what is possible. This is where you can
where you can go. And then I can show you another example where you can see.
