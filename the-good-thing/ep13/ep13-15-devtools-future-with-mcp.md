And in the workflow. Two, you never left the IDE once. You just implemented three pieces of
functionality without ever leaving that.
00:59:09:05 - 00:59:30:00
Jens
But also, if you think about it, when we when we did, the, the, schema proposal, we could
actually see what our, the results of our work, we could see it in the studio and we can then
visualize the changes and, and everything. Like, you remember how I, we found, the, the
different everything where the field added.
00:59:30:02 - 01:00:07:20
Jens
But yeah, overall, I think one observation from my side is previously, you would always build
user interfaces to interact with the system, especially in the dev tools space. This has shifted.
We're now using things like, CLIs and terraforming and other methods of interacting with the
system. And I think MCP is is a new way where you now have your IDE and you just prompt
from your IDE and now it can it can do these powerful workflows.
01:00:07:20 - 01:00:47:27
Jens
And essentially your IDE is now like, like, Copilot, the workflow manager and, and you're, you're
more high level. And beyond that, what I find interesting is your IDE can now interact with
cosmos Schema Registry, and it can do the same thing with other tools. And I think it's it's now
the time for dev tool makers to, to think about okay, how can we how can we elevate the
workflows of our users, the developers, and how can we help them automate tasks and work
better?
01:00:47:27 - 01:00:52:00
Jens
And, I think this is a very interesting space.
01:00:52:02 - 01:00:58:21
Stefan
Incredible. We do have to cut it now. We actually hit the full hour begins. What's the good thing?
01:00:58:24 - 01:01:04:29
Jens
Where are we back next week? Because there is this thing called Easter.
01:01:05:02 - 01:01:08:01
Stefan
I'm off on Monday for Easter.
01:01:08:04 - 01:01:09:09
Jens
I,
01:01:09:11 - 01:01:12:08
Stefan
Yeah, that's what I celebrate at the 21st.
01:01:12:10 - 01:01:12:24
Jens
But we'll see.
01:01:13:01 - 01:01:21:25
Stefan
I'll post an update on LinkedIn if you're off on Friday. We'll then do another episode the week
after, but we'll keep you guys updated. The good thing is MCp is now available in one graph.
Cosmo.
01:01:21:27 - 01:01:24:03
Jens
Yes. Try it out. Give us feedback.
01:01:24:05 - 01:01:25:25
Stefan
Okay. Awesome. Thanks everybody.
01:01:25:25 - 01:01:29:08
Jens
See you. MCP.
01:01:29:08 - 01:01:31:01
Stefan
Jarvis. Jarvis, get to work.
