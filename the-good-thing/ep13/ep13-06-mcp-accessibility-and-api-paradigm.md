summary: |
  Jens envisions MCP connector marketplaces and "Cursor but for humans" applications for non-technical users. They discuss the complexity of modern web development versus simple HTML/CSS days, exploring whether AI could crawl websites without APIs, and introduce the "turtles all the way down" concept - that everything ultimately becomes APIs.

Jens
But I, I think what we will see in the future is like marketplaces for these MCP connectors. And I
think we will we will see things like cursor but for humans. So for for normal people with not not
with code, I like it needs to be a different level of abstraction. And I'm, I'm super curious to see
what what kind of applications, people will be, will be able to, to develop.
00:19:54:14 - 00:20:09:18
Jens
But I think the one of the first big problems we have to solve is, Yeah, abstracting away the
complexity of APIs, making APIs easier to, to grasp for for everybody. Do you see.
00:20:09:18 - 00:20:15:21
Stefan
A future where we won't even need APIs? We're just MCp can go and just not even an API.
00:20:15:21 - 00:20:17:22
Jens
But do you know what MCPs.
00:20:17:24 - 00:20:19:07
Stefan
It's basically an API.
00:20:19:09 - 00:20:21:14
Jens
It's an API. Yeah, but I'm just.
00:20:21:14 - 00:20:24:21
Stefan
Wondering, like, and,
00:20:24:23 - 00:20:34:16
Jens
Do you know this this, turtles all the way thing? No. What is a like. Let me check. Yeah.
00:20:34:18 - 00:20:49:25
Stefan
But what I'm trying to get at is like, let's say a website doesn't have an API. Could AI in MCP go
and still grab all the data from that website by just like, let's say, crawling it or whatever. Do you
think that'd be possible?
00:20:49:27 - 00:20:54:23
Jens
But crawling a website. Yeah. And then what?
00:20:54:26 - 00:21:09:22
Stefan
But like it gets all the information. Like if it wasn't a, if it was an API, is that like, say, a website
doesn't have an API or a product, but MCP can go and just grab all the information from it as if it
were an API.
00:21:10:05 - 00:21:47:01
Jens
I think it would definitely be like, technically possible. Yes. Well, one of the big issues is we're
we're building HTML websites with interactive react for humans. So, that there was a time in like
when, when you were very, very young, I was a little bit less young. But I mean, I'm also not so
old in terms of the internet, but there was a time when the when the internet, the, the w w w it
was actually mostly HTML and a little bit of CSS.
00:21:47:03 - 00:22:09:29
Jens
Yeah. And we have turned the internet into a whole mess with JavaScript. And yeah, LLM
cannot really do so much with it. So you, you could or you, you would have to build a browser
like a headless browser browser and then and then like an agent could use this headless
browser to go through the web and do things for you.
00:22:10:01 - 00:22:22:09
Jens
It could kind of work. Yeah. But yeah, I think API sorry, MCP it would just be much easier. Like
just give me the Json thing and I can do something with it.
00:22:22:12 - 00:22:27:03
Stefan
No I agree, and you said you wanted to show something with the turtles. What was that?
00:22:29:06 - 00:22:47:01
Jens
Yeah. Like if you Google turtles all the way, but I can see all the, the, the, the idea is essentially
that if you look through it, it's, it's all just turtles. And then they're small turtles and it's, it's with
API, it's like.
00:22:47:03 - 00:22:50:03
Stefan
Oh I have infinite regress okay I see.
00:22:50:05 - 00:22:59:06
Jens
Yeah it's, it's API, it's all the way like everything is API. It's like your phone and its APIs and even
if it's MCP, it's still APIs.
00:22:59:09 - 00:23:06:15
Stefan
podcast.
Okay. Very cool. Actually, I've never heard that before. I always learn something new on the
