Stefan
Yeah. I mean, it is the elephant in, like, every room. And like, last night I was at dinner with, my
wife's parents and a couple of their friends, and, they're a bit older, you know, they're, like, in
their 50s. And they were talking, and I asked them. I was like, well, I'm 27. You guys were alive
and well when the internet was shifting, you know, during the dotcom era and everything was
changing.
00:04:24:06 - 00:04:41:26
Stefan
And then I kind of grew up and I saw the shift, the cloud. I was there when Dropbox was
released, and then I was there also when we shifted to the iPhone, Apple stores, and we went
through all these shifts. But what I can't help but notice is this is probably the biggest shift of
them all. Like it feels like we're in the.com boom again.
00:04:42:03 - 00:05:06:13
Stefan
But for AI, we're on this forefront of unexplored technology. It's just getting better each day. And
if you remember, I think two years ago or a year ago when OpenAI was really, when ChatGPT
was released, if you compare it to what it is now and what it can do. And then I was talking to a
friend, he just graduated college, and he's like, how did you, did you finish your computer
science degree without ChatGPT?
00:05:06:16 - 00:05:25:28
Stefan
Like, we're getting to that point now where people are like, how did you do something before AI?
And so I think right now where we're at and everything that's changing, it's every single industry
is going to change. So healthcare, technology, even like running a small business, everything is
going to eventually have AI. And if you look now, you don't have an iPhone Jens.
00:05:26:01 - 00:05:43:10
Stefan
But I don't know if they've started to add it to your Google Pixel, but they have now Apple
Intelligence, which in the phone it does things to help automate your life and it just adds AI
summarizes messages together. It gives you smart shortcuts and things like that. And so I'm
pretty sure that AI is going to be everywhere, probably in your car soon.
00:05:43:10 - 00:05:48:07
Stefan
It's just going to be everywhere that you could even think of. Insane, right?
00:05:48:10 - 00:05:51:01
Jens
I have a MacBook, you have a MacBook.
00:05:51:01 - 00:06:12:29
Stefan
But you don't have oh wait, you do have Apple intelligence, but it's different on the phone. I'm
going to be completely honest. It's not as good as I thought it would be, but it's getting better, so
I'll give them that. But where we're going now with AI is absolutely insane. And so let's start off,
though, before we go into like the demo of what we've been working on, let's talk a little bit
about the API, or the AI memo is what we'll call it.
00:06:12:29 - 00:06:21:03
Stefan
So for those of you that don't know about, the Amazon API mandate, this was released in like
2002 or something.
00:06:21:06 - 00:06:22:01
Jens
00:06:22:04 - 00:06:44:24
Stefan
And Jeff Bezos made a mandate of like ten rules that everything must flow, all information
between teams must flow through APIs. And it's a famous memo and it's called the API
mandate. And what's crazy is, we're seeing it again. And when we're seeing it, and I'll share my
screen so we can jump right to it. But this is a leaked memo from Tobias Lutke from Shopify.
00:06:44:26 - 00:07:11:03
Stefan
And, he got ahead of the curve and he jumped right into it. And he started to explain that usage
and reflexive AI usage is now a baseline expectation at Shopify. So he's basically telling all his
employees that you have to use AI alongside your journey of working at Shopify. And the
biggest thing here is right here is that in their company, they grow 20 to 40% year over year.
00:07:11:09 - 00:07:28:08
Stefan
You must improve by at least that much each year just to requalify your position at Shopify. That
goes for him as well as for everybody else. What's insane to me about that 20 to 40%
improvement per year is a lot, right?
00:07:29:12 - 00:07:31:16
Jens
I don't know. It's hard to quantify, so.
00:07:31:24 - 00:07:48:00
Stefan
But I wouldn't say it is. But when you incorporate AI, which is exactly what he says out in the
memo, is that it doesn't seem that hard of a fact because you can use AI to basically improve
and go further out. But this is where it gets interesting. And Jens I'd love your thoughts about
this. But this is crazy.
