00:05:01:17 - 00:05:26:26
Robert Farr
Yeah. So, so funny enough, I, so towards the end of, you know, the last thing I was working on it
at Cerner, we had built a, you know, a SaaS cloud based SaaS offering, multi-tenant, and, you
know, when I first got there, you know, often when you go really fast, right, you, you hit that
initial thing and then you start to scale, right?
00:05:26:26 - 00:05:57:09
Robert Farr
And scale brings new challenges, when you're adding customers very rapidly. And, so I deviated
from kind of, you know, distributed systems, a distributed databases for a while and help bring
in, kind of the site reliability engineering practice in that space. And two of, my main leads, a
week apart, in 2020 told me, hey, we are going to go work for this exciting new company.
00:05:57:11 - 00:06:11:21
Robert Farr
And neither knew that either. Or. And they both went to the same place. It was procore. So that
caught my attention. And, it was a little about a year later, that, I finally saw a position and
decided to take a deeper look.
00:06:11:23 - 00:06:15:09
Stefan
And was this pre IPO that you joined or post?
00:06:15:11 - 00:06:20:18
Robert Farr
I joined post they joined pre. So we're right on that. Both sides of that boundary okay.
00:06:20:25 - 00:06:42:27
Stefan
And if you could for the audience just tell a little bit about what Procore does. Because most
people don't know this. But a building that you've probably been in used software to help build it
with. Procore was a very fast growing startup. I read a little bit about, about the CEO and the
journey that he took it, but hold on, it's a little bit about what Procore does and the software and
just what you've helped build with them.
00:06:42:29 - 00:07:11:16
Robert Farr
Yeah, yeah. So Procore, so Procore really, you know, history historically is really focused on the
general contractor. So, project management, quality and safety has kind of been the bread and
butter. And so really any large, you know, schools, hospitals, buildings. Right, you know, roads
and bridges. Right. All of these large construction projects, almost all of them use procore, in
some sense to help manage those projects.
00:07:11:19 - 00:07:35:16
Robert Farr
Manage all the details, all the workers. And we're continuing to then build and expand upon that,
doing more and more what we call workforce management, you know, work, field work
solutions. So when you get to the construction site and you see software on site, you know,
helping and helping those in construction, get the job done and you'll see Procore present there.
00:07:35:19 - 00:07:40:01
Robert Farr
It's amazing. And go ahead. Oh, go ahead, go ahead.
00:07:40:04 - 00:07:50:00
Stefan
I was just going to say so, like when I did the research on Procore the founder. He was a
contractor, right. And then he kind of saw that in the market that there was no tool to help with
this.
00:07:50:03 - 00:08:18:07
Robert Farr
Yeah, yeah. To, you know, to me and this is what's for me was interesting. Right? Because
when you see, founder led startups, there's a lot of passion that goes with that. And that Tooey.
He saw a problem in the construction industry. And, you know, took that opportunity to say, let's
go build something different. What's interesting and, and this is, you know, my, my theory on
enterprise SaaS, is it actually takes a long time, a lot longer than you think.
00:08:18:09 - 00:08:46:29
Robert Farr
So Procore had been around 15 to 19 years, I think, before it really before an IPO. And yeah,
and some of that is, you know, you're trying to serve an industry that is not yet quite caught up
to technology adoption. Health care was very similar. I would say it me, you know, led
construction, you kind of see the construction industry really embracing technology.
00:08:47:02 - 00:09:02:25
Robert Farr
And, you know, there's, I think Tooey said of one time he said he was trying to decide, you know,
if it was construction or agriculture. So, you know, maybe someday agriculture would be that
next big wave of, kind of technology innovation and the enterprise side. So that's a great point.
00:09:02:28 - 00:09:12:18
Stefan
Jens. Do you have any questions or points to add to that? I, I read a lot about Tooey journey.
Know that he started off as a contractor. He didn't have a tech background. Right. He was just a
general contractor. And he saw a problem.
00:09:12:19 - 00:09:34:26
Robert Farr
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, he he was, you know, Tooey, you know, as I understand, you know, he was
the guy that came in and he framed everything up right? Like that was his, his trade. But he, you
know, like you said, he saw that it was hard on those in construction, right? Like, it's it's, you
know, for those who who work construction, they know how hard it can be.
00:09:34:28 - 00:09:53:17
Robert Farr
Many times as long hours. It's aggressive timelines. And there's communication is paramount,
right? Like the ability to share information accurately is paramount when you're trying to
coordinate, you know, so many different companies and so many different individuals on a large
and complex, project.
00:09:53:20 - 00:10:10:26
Stefan
You know what's exciting Jens I don't know if you're hearing it, but, we're going to dive into, like,
your experience and what you're building up for. But what you just said was construction like
timelines, communications. You guys are more or less doing the same thing now, but just in the
software space. You're not building hospitals, you're building the software that helps power
those hospitals.
