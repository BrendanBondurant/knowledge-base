Robert Farr
So it's kind of it's kind of two sided, but it is a, it's a top down strategy at Procore. You know, that
that it is, you know, we're going to be a, you know, I'll say an AI first company. You'll see, you'll
see a lot of that. In procores publications, if you go out there today. But we're trying to we're
trying to take advantage.
01:03:30:04 - 01:03:56:03
Robert Farr
And there's, there's a, it's interesting because this is the you know, I said earlier, like, this is the
biggest shift I've seen in my career in the software industry, right. Like, this is, this is huge. It's
changing the game for so many things. Right. And it's going to have so many impacts on so
many areas, not just of how we do software development, but also like how we use tools, how
we get our jobs done every day.
01:03:56:05 - 01:04:14:27
Robert Farr
And, you know, I think there's a there's a window here where companies are either, you know,
you kind of got to dive all in. And, you know, we're in the exploration phase. So it's, you know,
it's it's going to be interesting while you're in that exploration phase. But if you don't, you know,
we're going to come out of this.
01:04:15:00 - 01:04:39:16
Robert Farr
And if you're a late adopter now you find yourself kind of behind, right? Really. Right. And, so I
think, you know, for me, companies need to be embracing this, and, and it's it's change, right?
It's everything's changing really fast. There's security concerns, you know, there's all those
things that go with it. But it's kind of a race right now.
01:04:39:19 - 01:04:57:16
Robert Farr
And to, you know, figuring out how to as we explore, figuring out how to, we can get to the point
of really exploiting the value of it, creating, you know, creating better, more customer value.
Ultimately, you know, that leads to better business value. Those are going to be the things that
are going to drive companies, and you'll see the companies that do it.
01:04:57:16 - 01:05:10:12
Robert Farr
I think they'll come out in a much better positions. And I think companies that are going to be,
you know, maybe a little conservative or risk averse might find themselves, in a really bad
position in a few years.
01:05:10:15 - 01:05:24:01
Stefan
Well, said and what a great, you know, quote to kind of end the podcast. Well, Robert, thank you
so much for joining us today. And the good thing, we really appreciate the conversation. We love
what we're building together. And the way we usually end this episode is I just go to Jens and I
say, hey, Jens.
01:05:24:02 - 01:05:26:06
Stefan
What's the good thing?
01:05:26:08 - 01:05:28:20
