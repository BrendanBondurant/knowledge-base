00:47:02:27 - 00:47:05:07
Jens
Like it's not going to happen.
00:47:05:10 - 00:47:26:17
Stefan
But what about companies like railway? So if you go back, you have AWS and you have
companies like railway that are doing kind of like OpenAI focus on research, but that in the
future is going to hire someone to be the CEO research. And then infra. Yeah, it's kind of crazy.
Jens I think you're spot on and it makes sense.
00:47:26:20 - 00:47:49:24
Stefan
It's weird, like competition and capitalism. You know, it pushes innovation. But at the end of the
day, you're right. Like there are a few companies, like for example, there's Google, Azure and
what is it, AWS. They own the cloud space they completely own it. And this is a $100 billion
market. It's massive. And they just completely own it. The same thing is going to happen in AI.
00:47:49:24 - 00:48:05:12
Stefan
Is it a good thing. Is it a bad thing? Is it going to lead to more innovation I don't know. Will they
are completely own it. Yeah they will. But like for example railway. Do you think that they're
doing successful like they have millions in revenue. They're growing but they're built on top of
AWS. They're just a faster experience.
00:48:05:12 - 00:48:10:24
Stefan
Do you think we'll have more railways before AI. Companys just wrappers. Is that a bad thing?
00:48:10:26 - 00:48:38:03
Jens
Not, not not a bad thing at all. I think at some point there's also the question, what kind of stuff
does openAI want to focus on. Let's say you're OpenAI or Google or someone else. It could be
enough to to just build a good model and, sell it efficiently. And then you have those wrapper
companies who resell it like the, the vercels of AI.
00:48:38:03 - 00:49:09:14
Jens
So to say, I think that that is one thing that that could happen. You know, I think it's a little bit like,
one thing I learned from from Warren Buffett about Berkshire Hathaway is, in terms of investing,
you have to invest in different ways compared to when you are like, let's say you have your
fount sizes 100 K, 100 K, us dollars, like your your personal money or something.
00:49:09:21 - 00:49:35:16
Jens
You invest that in a different way compared to, let's say, you you manage a false fount size of, I
don't know, 200 billion or something. You can't just buy a Coca-Cola overnight or something. It's
it's going to destroy the market. So you have to, to, to behave in a different way. And I think the
same thing is true for, OpenAI and, the big LLM providers or cloud providers.
00:49:35:19 - 00:50:06:12
Jens
I think you also want to have some competition and you want to have users using your, your,
your agents and such. But, one thing we've, we've seen a lot in the recent, recent, I would say
like 12 months or something. In the beginning, there were some startups who built tools on top
of, GitHub with LLMs, and they did like automated pull request reviews or something but now.
00:50:06:15 - 00:50:35:19
Jens
Yeah. But now something happens. Where? Where you see again how important this
distribution, a player like, like Microsoft, Microsoft owns GitHub. So they just observe the market
and they see, okay, someone has built a copilot to review pull requests, but GitHub has better
distribution. So all they do is tell everybody, guys, here's this thing, we call it copilot.
00:50:35:19 - 00:50:45:06
Jens
It can now review your pull request. All you have to do is click on the pull request and invite
copilot as a reviewer.
00:50:45:09 - 00:50:46:17
Stefan
Yeah.
00:50:46:19 - 00:51:10:03
Jens
And yeah, that's also the same reason why, why, for example, Microsoft Teams is more
successful in terms of, of revenue and growth compared to, to slack. Slack is probably the better
application. But over time, Microsoft Teams is just stealing the features and they have better
distribution. So in the end, distribution wins.
