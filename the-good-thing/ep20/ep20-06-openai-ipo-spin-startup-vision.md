Jens
AI by the way, I'm not even sure if this is actually helpful for anthropic or others, because now
people fear that the LLM or the AI will take over. But but it's it's not happening in this way. And
also. One, one thing, I just the other day, because we were also talking about, OpenAI and how
they might, go to go public.
00:29:37:15 - 00:30:07:23
Jens
And I think also one big things, big distinction we have to make is that llms will not lead to
general artifice intelligence like LLMs can. You can make the models bigger and bigger and
bigger, and they might know more stuff and whatever. But it's not it's not thinking. And you can
also build systems that use LLMs in a more thinking way so that they iterate more on an idea.
00:30:07:23 - 00:30:23:24
Jens
They don't just give you the first thing, they iterate more. But that is still LLMing, so it's still
generating tokens. It's just you build a framework around it so that it thinks more about this small
thinking.
00:30:23:27 - 00:30:50:14
Stefan
What's crazy, though, is the point. Like to the openAI. IPO it's a good transition. My question is, I
don't know if anthropic released this themselves. I think. Let me double check myself. Is a senior
reporter specializing in AI and emerging technologies. I don't know if he wanted to, but one thing
that they could do with spinning the media is that they could incite fear, and then they could
backtrack and say, but we're the only company that can stop that fear.
00:30:50:16 - 00:31:16:24
Stefan
Here's how it blackmails, and here's how we stop that as a company. So I'm wondering if maybe
it's a good thing because fear is a very powerful motivator. And I'll give you an example. Like for
example, I'll give you an example, all these people, which is ridiculous. VCs and everything you
see on LinkedIn, which is saying that AI is going to wipe away customer success, it's going to
wipe away this, it's going to wipe it that, and it's pushing people away by fear.
00:31:16:24 - 00:31:31:20
Stefan
So I'm wondering if this was a topic by anthropic on purpose. We might see an article in the next
couple of weeks saying that like, sure it tried to blackmail, but we're the only company that can
handle this with our safety team or something like that. You know what I'm trying to say? Yeah, I
have my marketing hat on.
00:31:31:20 - 00:31:35:11
Stefan
I really do. Yeah.
00:31:35:14 - 00:31:50:04
Jens
I don't know. I'm not sure if it's if it's helpful. I absolutely love LLMs. I think they are super
powerful. If you if you use them in the right way.. For example, code generation a topic we can
we can also talk about. But yeah.
00:31:50:06 - 00:32:08:04
Stefan
Well let's get to the next one because I do want to save a time for the plug ins, the connectors.
What are we calling them. The new thing. The new thing from wundergraph. All right so last
screen share. Hold up I need to share this one. So yes. So that way we can see it.
00:32:08:06 - 00:32:11:06
Jens
But by the way Jacob do I have enough headroom.
00:32:11:09 - 00:32:17:04
Stefan
Our content producer was making fun of u, He was like saying, guys, you need to make sure
you have enough. Headroom. Which is true though.
00:32:17:04 - 00:32:24:21
Jens
We have this on, on, on every, prep. But for this Hey Jens you need more headroom.
00:32:24:24 - 00:32:53:10
Stefan
He just has a big head. That's a thing. But first of all, can I just acknowledge how ridiculous this
is, that you can start a nonprofit, you can start a nonprofit, and then you can IPO, like anything
is possible in this world. So basically, I don't understand this. They've taken more than 13 billion
from Microsoft and it's converting its for profit into a public beneficiary corp, a structure designed
to rebalance shareholders return with social goals.
00:32:53:10 - 00:33:11:21
Stefan
Unlike nonprofits, which is focused solely on the public good. I'm going to be completely honest.
Sam Altman is not a dumb guy. I really think from the very beginning he did it as a nonprofit.
From the start, I don't think he would have gone as far as he could have gotten with regulation
and everything if he wasn't a nonprofit.
00:33:11:23 - 00:33:14:14
Stefan
What do you think on that?
00:33:14:16 - 00:33:16:29
Jens
Can you scroll all the way up?
00:33:17:02 - 00:33:19:25
Stefan
Yeah. one sec
00:33:19:27 - 00:33:43:13
Jens
Because I have to apologize, but I'm I'm just I'm just a very weird person how I read stuff. Okay,
let's read the headline. Open AI CFO says, okay, so what do you think? Do you think the
OpenAI CFO has shares in OpenAI?
00:33:43:15 - 00:33:45:04
Stefan
Yes, of course.
00:33:45:07 - 00:33:46:22
Jens
Lots of shares. Right?
00:33:46:24 - 00:33:52:14
Stefan
I mean, Chief Financial Officer Yeah, actually shes got a lot she didn't know. Motivated to IPO.
00:33:52:16 - 00:33:57:24
Jens
Okay, let's translate shareholder of shares.
00:33:57:27 - 00:33:59:16
Stefan
Says.
00:33:59:19 - 00:34:07:22
Jens
New structure of company opens door for potential IPO.
