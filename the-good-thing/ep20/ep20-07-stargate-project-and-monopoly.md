00:34:07 - 00:34:09
Jens
Who wouldn't say that.
00:34:09 - 00:34:11
Stefan
So now my shares.
00:34:11 - 00:34:14
Jens
Are worth more right. Ther's the potential for an IPO.
00:34:15 - 00:34:22
Stefan
Yeah. I mean she's also driving up. She's also driving up the value of her shares by just saying
that.
00:34:22 - 00:34:26
Jens
I yeah, that's what I mean. Dude.
00:34:26 - 00:34:51
Stefan
This is actually kind of funny. A PBC can get us an IPO if and when we want to. see what's
funny. Like media is getting so annoying. Like she's just hyping it up and it doesn't even say that
they're going to IPO. It's if and if we want to so what she's done with this article with readers is
just simply hype up her company to drive up the value of it even more.
00:34:51 - 00:35:10
Stefan
And I think it was David who said this, but basically it's smoke and mirrors. It's just like you say
something, you hype it up even more, and it's like we might IPO and it's like, oh crap, we have
to get in. We have to get in. And I bet she's going to happen. They're they're going to have
another funding round of something ridiculous in the next coming months.
00:35:10 - 00:35:13
Stefan
And this would have helped with it. But this is kind of interesting.
00:35:13 - 00:35:20
Jens
Yeah. It imagine you had some VCs on the tipping point of investing.
00:35:20 - 00:35:24
Stefan
Yeah. Like they just missed the last round. Yeah.
00:35:24 - 00:35:52
Jens
And she's thinking how can I how can I increase the, the price of the secondaries? I'm, I'm
selling if and can, you scroll back up again because she's not even saying anything about it, an
IPO or something. It's more like OpenAI CFO says new structure opens door for potential IPO.
So essentially she said nothing.
00:35:52 - 00:36:10
Stefan
Oh, I feel like we're in the wrong space. Like we build for our customers. We actually care about
our customers and we build for them. And it's and what I've seen is like, for example, yesterday I
met with this girl. She's helping this other company. They raised a $20 million series A on vision.
Okay. It's a really great vision.
00:36:10 - 00:36:31
Stefan
It's supposed to help with AI. They just raised an $80 million series A, and I go, oh my God. Like,
how much traction do they have? Like how much how much revenue do they have. Oh, they
don't have any revenue yet. Oh, well, how's the product coming along? Oh, the product's not
done yet. Oh, why did they wait
00:36:31 - 00:36:52
Stefan
How did they go from 20 to 80 million? Well. What happened? Oh, the vision. I'm like the vision.
Yeah. It's such a grand vision. It's capital intensive. It needs more money. Okay. Did the
founders sell anything on secondaries in between their round? Oh, yeah. Yeah he did. Brother,
this guy just made him himself and his whole generation rich by just selling a vision.
00:36:52 - 00:36:55
Stefan
Just a vision like I've seen the tech.
00:36:55 - 00:36:57
Jens
Have you watched Silicon Valley?
00:36:57 - 00:36:58
Stefan
Yeah, I know the scene with,
00:36:59 - 00:36:59
Jens
No, no.
00:36:59 - 00:37:05
Stefan
Do you know what? Oh, no. The most important rule. No revenue. Yeah.
00:37:05 - 00:37:06
Jens
No revenue.
00:37:06 - 00:37:27
Stefan
When you put revenue, then it diminishes the dream because revenue will never be enough.
But if you have no revenue, you can constantly sell the dream, which is. Yes, honestly. Second
startup I started absolutely no revenue. It's just going to be vision. Here's the vision. Yeah. Thing
is, though. It's all smoke and mirrors. It's really annoying. But we'll get to it.
00:37:27 - 00:37:41
Jens
But I also want to say something on the, on the on the other side of the spectrum. So that's a
new project going. It's called Project Starship. Have you heard of Project Starship?
00:37:41 - 00:37:44
Stefan
No I haven't, should we bring it up? Yeah.
00:37:44 - 00:37:47
Jens
Google Project Starship.
00:37:47 - 00:37:54
Stefan
Project Starship on steam no I'm kidding. The one from SpaceX?
00:37:54 - 00:37:55
Jens
No.
00:37:55 - 00:37:57
Stefan
Is it from Space-X?
00:37:57 - 00:38:05
Jens
No, it's from from the US government. Is it called Starship, actually, or am I wrong?
00:38:05 - 00:38:09
Stefan
It's the super heavy project, but it's being done by SpaceX. Is that it?
00:38:09 - 00:38:23
Jens
No, no, no, it's it's not that. What's this program by the U.S government to invest into into AI? It's
it's a collaboration of SoftBank. Starlink. No it's SoftBank.
00:38:23 - 00:38:27
Stefan
It's you know what you're talking star Oracle from OpenAI. It's star Stargate.
00:38:27 - 00:38:29
Jens
Is it Stargate.
00:38:29 - 00:38:33
Stefan
Yeah yeah. Hold up I'm bringing it up. It's from OpenAI I remember I.
00:38:33 - 00:38:35
Jens
Mixed it I mixed it.
00:38:35 - 00:38:36
Stefan
One sec. Let me re share.
00:38:36 - 00:38:37
Jens
Stargate.
00:38:37 - 00:38:51
Stefan
I remember this is like when they announced their latest funding round. They're like. Also, we're
getting 100 billion to deploy the infrastructure immediately. I remember it was also a big turning
point in the election in the US, which was huge.
00:38:51 - 00:39:28
Jens
Yeah. Okay. So, for the forget about, precedents and everything, the important bit is. So I
watched this, documentary about it. It's a collaboration of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle also
NGX, but not sure what NGX is but essentially and, you don't need to to share, by the way. It's
it's fine, but, it's, it's crazy what they are building and, and I think it is something it's, it's
important to think about what's, what's happening here because I think it has an effect on many
startups.
00:39:28 - 00:40:23
Jens
Essentially what OpenAI is doing together with Oracle is they build whole data centers. They
build the biggest GPU farm in the, in the world, essentially open AI will will own a huge compute
cluster to predict your tokens. So they are building the biggest hardware platform to give you llm
capabilities. So what that means for any wrapper or anybody who builds a startup with llms, you
need to be extremely careful in what you're building, because I think in the long term, what's
going to happen is you build these wrappers, you build AI tools, open AI will eventually eat up
everything that works, and they will have the hardware.
