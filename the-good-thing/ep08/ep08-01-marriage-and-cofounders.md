Episode 8
00:00:22:11 - 00:00:33:12
Stefan
And we're live. I'm back. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good
Thing, hosted by myself, Stefan, and my co-host Jens. How are you doing today?
00:00:33:15 - 00:00:34:18
Jens
I'm good.
00:00:34:20 - 00:00:36:28
Stefan
Can't complain. I'm doing better than almost.
00:00:37:00 - 00:00:41:00
Jens
Almost weekend. Yes, this is true.
00:00:41:00 - 00:00:55:26
Stefan
It is almost the weekend for you. The day is just starting out for me. But, apologies, guys. If you
hear a little bit in my voice, I have lost my voice because I just got married last week, and so I'm
still recovering from that. It was an absolute blast.
00:00:55:28 - 00:01:00:11
Stefan
You can ask me about my wedding Jens, no? or we just go straight to tech topics. Yeah.
00:01:00:11 - 00:01:05:03
Jens
I forgot my script.
00:01:05:05 - 00:01:10:09
Jens
Ask you about the wedding. Yeah, I, how old are you now, Stefan?
00:01:10:12 - 00:01:12:20
Stefan
27.
00:01:12:20 - 00:01:17:24
Jens
27 Okay. And, Yeah. How was your wedding?
00:01:17:27 - 00:01:36:16
Stefan
Wedding? Good. Yeah, it was, like, more of, like, a destination wedding. So, like three day
celebration, which is, like, more fun. We had people come out and people have been texting
that it was just amazing. I've already been married, though, for a couple of months, so. And I've
also been with my wife now six years, so nothing's changed on that front.
00:01:36:17 - 00:01:41:12
Stefan
Feels the exact same. But the party was cool. I really enjoyed, see like, you know, my family
and everybody there.
00:01:41:14 - 00:02:08:07
Jens
Yeah. Well, what do you think? And in terms of, you know, if you if you think about the, the
relationship with your partner, how do you think like, how impactful is, for example, moving
together or starting a relationship or marriage or stuff like that? Well, how do you think about the
impact of such events on your life?
00:02:08:10 - 00:02:30:15
Stefan
Yeah, I think it's important. And, I can actually relate this to start ups because we talk about this
a lot. Is that, like your co-founder, when you're looking for a co-founder, it's basically like looking
for, like a partner. Same thing that you do in your life. And like when you move together or you
raise around together or you just go through significant life events together, it's really important
that you have somebody there next to you that understands you.
00:02:30:15 - 00:02:48:08
Stefan
And it's even better, though, if you guys are opposites, like a yin and yang. So me and my wife,
where we're completely opposites, we're yin and yang and I see the same thing and our
founding team is that where I'm weak, our founding team is, one of our founders is strong, and
were another founder is weak at something another founder can complement that.
00:02:48:08 - 00:03:04:19
Stefan
And so with these significant life events, it makes everything so much easier when you have
somebody next to you. And so Y Combinator is always saying like have a good co-founder.
They say, having a good founder, co-founder is a like a hack. It's the same thing in life having a
good wife or a good husband. It's a hack.
00:03:04:19 - 00:03:26:26
Stefan
You can handle any storm together. Having a bad co-founder is really bad. It's actually worse to
have a bad co-founder than not having a co-founder at all. And it's the same thing in life. Having
a bad partner is worse than not having a partner at all. And so that's kind of the way that I see it.
I will say, though, at 27, my wife has like changed my life in a lot of ways I've been able to focus
on startups.
00:03:26:26 - 00:03:43:11
Stefan
I've been able to focus on WunderGraph and then I'm able to just been kind of headstrong onto
this. And so if you can get married early, I really think, you know, have fun in college, but get
married early. It helps you put your head on a swivel and really focus on the things that matter.
00:03:43:14 - 00:03:51:22
Jens
Interesting. Very interesting. You also said you and your wife. It's like yin and yang, but you still
need some common ground like right?
00:03:51:25 - 00:04:05:17
Stefan
So we align on the values. It's the same thing like with the founders, like why did we want to
start a company and what kind of culture do we want to build? And so with my wife we align on
the values of like what we want of life, how we want to raise our kids, where we want our kids to
go to school.
00:04:05:17 - 00:04:24:27
Stefan
And so we align on those, well, we're totally different. Like last night, she took me to a concert
called Santigold. It's like reggae and I'm not big on reggae, but she loves reggae. But I really
enjoyed the concert because she took me. And then sometimes I take her to concerts like, Pura
Vida or like John Summit, which is more like electronic music, and she doesn't really love that,
but she loves that.
00:04:24:27 - 00:04:33:21
Stefan
I love that. And so we get cool exposures in life because we're different. But when it comes to
the values, we're rock solid and we align on those.
00:04:33:23 - 00:04:50:05
Jens
Do you, do you remember like on old computers with, with hard disk drives, like not solid state,
but but HDDs, you had from time to time, you had to de-fragment your disk. Were you born
when we did that?
00:04:50:07 - 00:04:55:04
Stefan
I think I was born, but I don't think I actually ever did that. Why?
00:04:55:06 - 00:05:21:22
Jens
No, I don't know. But when you were talking about the relationship between you and your wife, I
was kind of thinking, my wife, she she acts a bit like, like a de-fragmentation system for me.
Like, I think without her, I would be a much worse human being because I'm focusing, like, so
much on, on, on tech and work.
00:05:21:25 - 00:05:47:00
Jens
And I really need someone who drags me back to life. And so, like, hey, and take the kids, let's
go outside and like, I, I really love the family and everything, but I don't know, somehow
something inside me drags me to the to the computer or to my office, and I, I want to work on on
WunderGraph, and it's good to have someone in life who.
00:05:47:03 - 00:06:03:09
Jens
Yeah. Who who helps you to to realize. Yeah, we're still humans. We're we're we're alive.
There's not just work. There's something else. And, yeah, I, I think having such a partner, it's, it's
a, it's a very good balance.
00:06:03:11 - 00:06:19:01
Stefan
I would agree and I think like I was talking about this with my mom the other day, my mom was
like, wow. Like yesterday I was on a meeting from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. I'm so exhausted. And I was
like, mom. Like, I usually do that every day. Like I'm on meetings every day, helping customers
on board or getting new customers.
00:06:19:04 - 00:06:41:11
Stefan
But she's like, I'm so tired. And then I was like, I'm not really tired. And we kind of like talked
about it. And it's like when you find something that you really care about, you can work hours
and hours and hours and you don't really get tired because you care and you're passionate
about it. And for me, like lately, I'd probably say the last year and a half and a half, I haven't
even gotten close to burning out, even though that we're working a lot of hours.
00:06:41:11 - 00:06:56:03
Stefan
And I think one, it's because we're growing. Two, it's because I really enjoy what we're doing.
But three, I would put this is as like my garbage collector is that Sofia comes and drags me out
of the house and she's like, you're going to this concert. And I'm like, I don't want to. But then
she's like, no, you're going.
00:06:56:03 - 00:07:20:00
Stefan
And then I go and I'm like, okay, I'm really glad that I went. I feel refreshed, I go back into today
like the office. I get to do a cool podcast and I get to go call. But I would agree totally with that.
It's really important to have a good partner that understands you. And last anecdote on this is, I
had a friend, he started 2 or 3 companies, and every time before he started the other company,
he would have, the talk with his wife and he'd be like, I'm doing it again.
00:07:20:03 - 00:07:34:19
Stefan
It's going to be hell. We're going through war. I won't do it. I can retire if you want, but let me
know what you want me to do. And the wife was like, I know you'll never retire. You're going to
do it anyways, so I might as well be there to support you. But I agree with everything you've said
so far.
00:07:34:22 - 00:08:01:19
Jens
Yeah. also. My my wife is sometimes really helpful, to like, I don't know, I, if I, if I have, like a
very controversial opinion sometimes it's really good to throw it at your wife and not go straight
to the team or to the founders or to the public, like, did put put it through the wife filter.
00:08:01:19 - 00:08:31:15
Jens
They sometimes they are like, you know, like, Dustin and I, I was like Dustin, our co-founder and
CTO. He's, he really cares about tech and good architecture and I would say I also care about
tech and architecture. And obviously we're not the same person. So sometimes we care about
different aspects of the software and the architecture and this can clash.
00:08:31:17 - 00:08:47:03
Jens
And, sometimes it's really good. Before you have an argument with someone, just say like, hey,
what do you think? How will Dustin react to that? And then, this sometimes the wife filter can
really help.
00:08:47:05 - 00:09:03:15
Stefan
Yeah. It's like quality control. That's your QA is like, if I just go say this and it's like, let me talk to
the wife first. And no, I would totally agree. But, yeah, the wedding was fantastic. You know,
nothing's really changed in the personal life other than we had a great celebration. Family was
there. But, yeah, I'm happy to be back.
