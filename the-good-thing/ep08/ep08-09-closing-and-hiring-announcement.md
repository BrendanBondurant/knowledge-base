Jens
And, yeah, we, we really hope that this helps you to convince your management and your
company, to adopt federation. Whichever vendor you're going with.
01:00:38:22 - 01:00:55:01
Stefan
Well, said Jens, so you guys can find the report on our website. It's on the banner. So if you just
head over to WunderGraph.com, you can click on the banner and it'll take you there to get to the
report. You can also head over to WunderGraph.com slash state of GraphQL federation slash
2024. With that. That is a conclusion of another episode of The Good Thing.
01:00:55:01 - 01:00:59:05
Stefan
But Jens, what's the good thing?
01:00:59:07 - 01:01:02:08
Jens
We're back next week.
01:01:02:11 - 01:01:20:11
Stefan
The good thing is we're back next week. We have some exciting stuff planned in the next couple
of weeks. We have an exciting announcement coming in the next couple of weeks, so maybe
we can hint a little bit about that. Look out for another case study coming out next week as well.
Feature updates from February. We're going to have a massive blast of those.
01:01:20:11 - 01:01:42:19
Stefan
There was a lot of stuff that happened in February and just a lot of exciting stuff. As always, we
are hiring. If you're really interested in GraphQL gateways or just high performance gateways
Federation, or just working really closely with enterprise customers with developer tooling,
please head over to our jobs page and apply. We are hiring. We have a person full time now
helping us recruit these, so we are growing and we are in a very good position.
01:01:42:19 - 01:01:59:09
Stefan
So if you want to join a really cool startup where we talk about cool stuff, build cool things, and
we're just completely transparent about the entire process, take a look at WunderGraph and as
Jens mentioned, the good thing is we are back next week. Thanks everybody. I just realized my
shirt says I don't work here. I actually do work here.
