Stefan
Your mic, your mic drop. Boom. No, but very fair. And then last topic I want to discuss. And so I
made a little joke. Jens had this idea. I would say November or December, but he's like, you
know what we should do? We should interview all of our customers and we should create a
State of Federation report.
00:54:44:10 - 00:54:59:05
Stefan
Postman does it with their state of APIs report. And so I was like, yeah, Jens, that's a great idea.
But a lot of stuff has been happening between it took me forever to get this out and finally into
the public. But today, what we're excited to announce, let me present my screen.
00:54:59:07 - 00:55:01:24
Jens
You didn't like the idea right.
00:55:01:25 - 00:55:26:28
Stefan
I just thought because I will explain why. So I like the idea. The only thing is, is it's a little bit
tricky because our market size isn’t massive. So the state of APIs from postman was like
45,000. And so we're giving you the full disclaimer. This state of GraphQL Federation report is
based on insights from over a thousand developers, architects and CTOs, but from our base,
our customer base.
00:55:26:28 - 00:55:46:07
Stefan
So full disclaimer, but that doesn't mean that the information inside it is not useful. So if you
head over to our website, you'll see at the very banner that it says the state of GraphQL
Federation. And you can quickly just enter in your email and you'll be able to get the report
emailed over to you. But this is jam packed with information of why GraphQL Federation.
00:55:46:14 - 00:56:15:27
Stefan
It comes from some great use cases, great customers that we have as well as from comments
and everything on them. Federation trends that we've seen. You'll also notice that we still have
the disclaimer there that all the respondents in the survey are WunderGraph customers, or in
the transition period of becoming a WunderGraph customer. But the information that is in there
is jam packed, and it also includes the future of federation where we see federation going and
why customers have been adopting federation.
00:56:15:29 - 00:56:48:19
Stefan
And so this is available today. It's a 48 page report. Just head over to the state of GraphQL
Federation slash 2024 and you can get the report. Jens. Any thoughts on this? I know why you
wanted to do it I think is jam packed with information, but what are your thoughts on the
GraphQL Federation, especially with that Gartner quote, which is let me scroll down to it and I'll
read it out loud, because this has been a milestone in the Federation space, is that by 2027,
more than 60% of enterprises will use GraphQL on production, up from less than 30%.
00:56:48:21 - 00:57:04:17
Stefan
But what's even more interesting is that 30% of these enterprises that are using GraphQL will be
using GraphQL Federation. This is up less than 5%. So Jens, what are your thoughts on the
state of GraphQL Federation? Why do we do it? What are the trends that we're seeing and what
can people expect from this report.
00:57:04:19 - 00:57:33:20
Jens
So our observation in the in the market is that, you know, when we when we started building
Cosmo, we, we, we initially thought that, most of our market would be coming from Apollo
because we're, we're the open source alternative to Apollo, or at least that's how we started.
And we thought most of our market is is coming from there.
00:57:33:22 - 00:58:09:13
Jens
What we what we see like this year, for example, let's I don't know, 80, 90% of our customers
are coming from outside Apollo. So the market is expanding. There is a lot of traction, a lot of
companies adopting, adopting federation and I wanted to start this initiative because I think, it's
super important to educate outside the people who are not yet on federation for them to
understand.
00:58:09:13 - 00:58:34:04
Jens
What do the people think who are on federation, how do they think about it? How do they, adopt
it? What are the benefits? Why do they do the adoption, all this kind of stuff. So we want to
share the knowledge from within the community with, or within the Federation community, with
the wider API community, so that everybody can, can learn.
00:58:34:04 - 00:59:00:05
Jens
What are the what are the impacts? And if, for example, you're a developer and you work at a
big bank or whatever, and your company is not yet using Federation, you want to have material
for your management to convince them this is the right direction and other companies are doing
it. It's successful. They have benefits. And so yeah, I think it's it's it's super important to to share
this, message.
00:59:00:08 - 00:59:24:00
Jens
And also you saw it with the disclaimer. So yeah, we interviewed all our customers. But what we
really would love to see if you sign up, we will include you in the, in the next survey for, for this
year. And we are really hoping to to see, to see also a much bigger usage numbers for Apollo
Federation.
00:59:24:02 - 00:59:56:00
Jens
Because ultimately, Apollo is the is the is the market leader and one very important message we
want to get out is we see large organization using both. So they use Apollo, they use Cosmo
side by side. And I think it's important for a stable ecosystem that there is no one player, that
there is no monopoly, but rather there are multiple players in the market.
00:59:56:03 - 01:00:26:05
Jens
There is competition. To be honest, I think if anything, we really pushed Apollo very hard to work
on, on, on some things and to, to improve stuff. So I think it's, it's great for everybody to have
competition and yeah, the, the state of federation should show that, federation is becoming an
enterprise standard. Companies are adopting it.
