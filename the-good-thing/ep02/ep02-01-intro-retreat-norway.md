Stefan

And we're back. Hey, everybody. Thank you guys so much for joining us today on another

episode of The Good Thing. I'm joined, as always, by my amazing co-host Jens. And today

we're going to be talking about some cool things that happened over the past, two weeks.

Apologies for not doing the last two weeks. I caught the flu.

00:00:43:07 - 00:00:54:26

Stefan

And then we also had our annual retreat, and we were up in Alta, Norway. So it's been a bit

since we last chatted. Jens, but, how are you? How are things? I mean, I talk to you all the time,

but how are things going with you?

00:00:54:28 - 00:00:58:10

Jens

I'm good. What do you think of the shirt?

00:00:58:13 - 00:01:03:03

Stefan

wife buy it?

I think it's better than most of your shirts. But I do like the fact that it's so nice. Where did your

00:01:03:03 - 00:01:07:09

Jens

For you? I think so.

00:01:07:11 - 00:01:13:04

Stefan

We have a funny joke here that. Jens he's like, I don't buy clothes. They just appear in my closet

because my wife bought it for.

00:01:13:06 - 00:01:14:17

Jens

Yeah, but.

00:01:14:17 - 00:01:34:03

Stefan

Awesome, dude. Today I'm excited to chat. Jens. So we got some really exciting stuff. So I want

to talk a little bit about, the culture and, the retreats that we do. And hopefully we can, I guess,

encourage some amazing engineers to join us. But Jens, talk to us about the past week. What

was your experience with Alta Norway?

00:01:34:06 - 00:01:43:13

Stefan

What what did you like about it? Tell us, maybe the audience a little bit about what we did up

there and just kind of what makes working at Wonder Graph amazing.

00:01:43:15 - 00:01:55:02

Jens

It was so funny. So we had, we had three batches off lights, so everybody came in in three

batches. I was in the last, but was it 2 or 3? Two, three?

00:01:55:05 - 00:01:56:15

Stefan

I don't know, because I took four.

00:01:56:17 - 00:02:15:27

Jens

No, no it was, it was three. Three Suvij and Nithin. Then you guys and then and then, Bjorn and

I and, Yeah. Imagine. So you fly into an airport in the middle of nowhere. You're on the last flight.

It's in the middle of the night. It's like 10 p.m. or something. You get your luggage.

00:02:16:03 - 00:02:42:08

Jens

Imagine this airport. It's like this. There's one. What's it called? The. Where you pick up your

luggage, the belts, the baggage claim. Yeah. Baggage claim. There's one little thing, and the

room is like just this one thing. That's the airport. You. You take your luggage, you walk out, and

then there comes, like a bus, with, like, weird lights and some weirdos step out, and they they

have, like, ten boxes of pizza.

00:02:42:10 - 00:03:02:11

Jens

That's. Yeah, that's just the scene. And every everything is like, snowy and everything. And then

we drive this bus to our lodge and, eventually the bus gets stuck because there was too much

snow. So we all get out and we carry our luggage, and then, yeah, we go into the lodge. We we

set up the fire and everything.

00:03:02:13 - 00:03:41:06

Jens

Over the days we had like two events. One event was, snow sledging with dogs, which was

pretty awesome. I have never thought that dogs can be such amazing. Animals, like how much

they can. They can carry. Imagine. Like, I'm, I'm not the, the most light person, but. Yeah. And, I

was together in the group with Nithin, so I don't know, like, probably 152 to 200 kilos, the sledge

and then five dogs in front of us, and they can pull it off, like, pretty decent.

00:03:41:06 - 00:04:06:01

Jens

So dogs are very cool. Like the. It was like Alaskan huskies. Pretty dope. Animals. Then we had

a workshop day. That was pretty, pretty cool because everybody, interacted in, really productive

way in, in such a place. It was also awesome. And then, third day we had this, what do you call

it, like motor skis, scooters, whatever.

00:04:06:03 - 00:04:43:28

Jens

Snowmobiling. Yeah. Snowmobile. And it was very interesting to explore the like the, the the

tundra there like everything is icy and whatnot and yeah, great views. Overall, it's it's really cool

that you can build the company that enables this kind of stuff and, and, yeah. So yeah, we're,

we're pretty happy of, of being able to, to, to do that and that, that we have all the, the support

from, from customers and the others who allow us to, to not just build a product, but also meet

from time to time.
