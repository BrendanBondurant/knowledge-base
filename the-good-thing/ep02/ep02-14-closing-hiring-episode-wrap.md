Stefan

Very interesting. And so with maybe for like the non-technical folks, this issue with the

descriptions, what's happening on the business impact or developer stepping over each other is

a slowing down development. On the business side, what is the problem that this is happening

not related to the tech side? Does that make sense?

00:57:03:10 - 00:57:35:16

Jens

I think yeah. So I would say for the, for the different stakeholders in your company, it's it's super

important to have, first of all, to have documentation on what the API does, how it works. And

sometimes you simply want to keep information within the team. And from our point of view,

coming back to our thoughts from earlier, Federation, it's a collaboration tool.

00:57:35:16 - 00:57:59:09

Jens

It allows teams to work together on an API, documentation, good documentation. It's it's

paramount to, to achieve that. It's it's the most important thing. So being able to have external

and internal documentation on, on the field, it's it's, yeah, it's it's very important because

otherwise people cannot work together. You want to know what's the what's the purpose of the

field.

00:57:59:12 - 00:58:07:01

Jens

And you want to explain to others how to use it. So yeah, I mean, that's. Yeah.

00:58:07:03 - 00:58:25:05

Stefan

Yeah. Well said and so we are at time. So what I do want to say are a little bit of closing notes.

So as discussed in the beginning wundergraph is hiring, we're hiring for engineers. We're hiring

on the marketing side. And there's going to be a lot more job postings coming soon. Benefits are

working. I wonder graph you get to work on some amazing technology.

00:58:25:05 - 00:58:44:25

Stefan

You get quarterly retreats, competitive compensation, choose your equipment, and quite

honestly, it's such a fun place to work as we did that like scale on the retreat, the biggest things

that our employees loved was how close they are to the customer and the impact that they're

making. So Wunder Graph is hiring. You can find it under our jobs.

00:58:44:27 - 00:59:01:21

wundergraph some skills that you have. You're like, you know what I think I can bring this impact

00:59:01:24 - 00:59:17:06

From that pre warming cache setting up for the Super Bowl is going to be amazing. Super

excited for that. But other than that Jens. Any closing words any exciting things. Other anything

that we should mention before we end episode two.

00:59:17:08 - 00:59:20:11

00:59:34:16 - 00:59:53:00

Stefan

Oh yeah. Jens is off next week, but I think I'm going to do an episode next week with Dustin or

Bjorn, one of the other co-founders, and I'll just chat with them. Could be fun, but you're going

skiing right? Oh, look who decided to show up. It's our good friend Mark. I hope Mark, you were
