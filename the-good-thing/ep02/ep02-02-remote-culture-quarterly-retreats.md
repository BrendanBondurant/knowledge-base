Jens

And, you know, we're, remote only company. So, yeah, we're we're happy.

00:04:51:09 - 00:05:09:12

Stefan

I would add to that. I mean, one of the coolest things about Wunder Graph is so we are remote.

First we set you up with some equipment wherever you work in the world, that's fine. So we

have very flexible PTO. But the most important thing is, is we have to meet in person at least

twice a year, the whole team, sometimes a little bit more often.

00:05:09:12 - 00:05:26:23

Stefan

When we get new hires, we fly them out to Germany. We get this really cool place. We work

together, we eat Frankfurt schnitzel with the green sauce, and we collaborate together. The

reason we do that is because, there's a thing called zoom fatigue. You know, like me and you

are on zoom, but there's no better collaboration than when we're in person.

00:05:26:23 - 00:05:46:10

Stefan

Or we do a customer call. And you're right, next to me. And one of the benefits of Wunder Graph

is we understand you have a family. We understand that you live where you live, live where you

live, work on good work, and then come hang out in Akta Norway, Majorca, Austria, Amsterdam.

We fly you out, all expenses paid for, and you hang out with the team.

00:05:46:10 - 00:06:00:25

Stefan

We do team building and what I've noticed and Jens, correct me on this, is every time we come

back from the retreats, the energy level is just off the roof for the next 2 or 3 months until we

meet again.

00:06:00:27 - 00:06:26:10

Jens

Yeah, I would agree. Also, I think every retreat it somehow helps us to, to sharpen what we think

is wundergraph, what we should focus on all these kind of things. So you can you can kind of

see the, the journey from the very beginning pivot. And then over the last two retreats, I think it

got really, really sharp.

00:06:26:12 - 00:06:36:10

Jens

And then now I see where we are. Yeah. What would you say? What are your highlights from

the, from the, recent retreat?

00:06:36:12 - 00:06:51:02

Stefan

So good question. So for the audience, I actually, the week before I had the flu and I was still

recovering from it, so I know why Jens asked this question, but, the medication caused me to

have some stomach problems, so I was there, but I was struggling a little bit with health. I'm all

good now, though.

00:06:51:02 - 00:07:13:08

Stefan

But the biggest highlights for me is, first of all, the transparency. As founders, we're really

transparent with everyone that's on board with the company. So Jens always does a state of

wonder graph presentation where we talk about the ARR, we talk about any new things that are

important in the company. We talk about the product direction and we talk about everything fully

transparent.

00:07:13:10 - 00:07:32:08

Stefan

Everybody knows what deals are in the pipeline. They know which potential customers we might

get, and they know everything that's happening. And I think that's super useful because Jens,

you give us a bird's eye view to everybody, whether you're an engineer, whether you're on the

marketing team, whether you're on customer support. And I think that's important because it

creates a sense of camaraderie.

00:07:32:08 - 00:07:50:25

Stefan

And also a sense of belonging to the company. Is that, hey, I'm not just an engineer, and my

code just isn't just for some random customers, it's for these customers. And I can actually

contribute for the company. And so I think that's one of the best highlights this year. One of the

best highlights that we did is, with our rapid growth, we acquired a lot of customers.

00:07:50:25 - 00:08:12:06

Stefan

And so we've had to, on the fly, build up customer support. And I'm quite proud of the team. and

how we've done it. But this year we did a, Customer Success award ceremony where we gave

out awards to Rising stars, to customer support, engineer of the year. And I think that was really

exciting because, the engineers got feedback on how they did on something that they've never

done before.

00:08:12:06 - 00:08:36:29

Stefan

They really picked it up on the fly. And I would say our customer support is top tier. And so that

was another highlight. And then the third highlight is just I mean, just sitting around the fire, you

know, bantering, playing Mario Kart and just chatting with the team is always a positive. But

doing it in Norway where you're surrounded by snow and a beautiful cabin and you get to go to

a nice dinner and really celebrate the last year's accomplishments, I would say those are my top

three highlights.
