Jens

And you can be more in the, on the side of, of customer enablement, something like, oh, yeah,

we we need a custom middleware here. We need like custom customization for, for metrics or, I

don't know, the, multi-part protocol is not exactly implemented like some spec says, or whatever,

these kind of things. And then you have like, deep, long term efforts where we say, okay, this is

where we want to be in one year.

00:17:04:02 - 00:17:10:13

Jens

And this is, bit different, scope of tasks.

00:17:10:15 - 00:17:25:19

Stefan

Yeah. Well said. And if I was an engineer and I wanted to work at wundergraph. How would I

catch your eye? Because, we see every application that comes in. How would I catch your eye

Jens where you were like, we need to interview this person.

00:17:25:22 - 00:17:58:10

Jens

So, you know, there's there's this, this mythical 10X engineer, and we are not so big fans of the

10x engineer. We are big fans of someone who is good enough in terms of tech to do what

needs to be done, but they are an excellent team player and communicator. We're a remote

company. If you work together with people for a long time and you want to achieve a goal

together, you don't need so many sprinters.

00:17:58:13 - 00:18:25:04

Jens

You need, marathon runners who can actually work together as a team. Because if you run a

marathon as a team, someone needs to be in front, block the wind, and then everybody can

follow on like, a little bit, less paramount and then you need to, to circle around. And for us it's,

it's a team effort, but still you need to run fast enough.

00:18:25:04 - 00:18:51:16

Jens

So there is like a threshold. You need to be good enough. And and that's that's one part. But

don't be afraid of of, joining as a junior. We absolutely love juniors with the right attitude

because, we believe it's actually harder to hire seniors, seniors often they are they are

opinionated. They have habits. This can be good.

00:18:51:18 - 00:19:12:27

Jens

And it's also possible that they are incompatible with how we think versus juniors their opinion.

Often it is not yet so strong. So you can you can mold them a little bit more. So actually we like

both like for for seniors we need to see are they compatible with us. And it's okay. It's not like

everyone is different.

00:19:12:27 - 00:19:34:25

Jens

That's that's fine. And for for juniors we're also very open. So please, if you are a junior dev and

you're, you're ambitious and you're, you're super interested in learning and expanding. We hired

a bunch of juniors like, two years ago, and it's it's absolutely crazy what they have achieved in

two years. So, yeah.

00:19:34:27 - 00:19:52:06

Stefan

Yeah. Well said. And I think it's a good transition. So Jens mentioned, we're hiring. You can see

we've posted more jobs and they're going to keep posting. So keep a lookout on our jobs tab.

But I want to transition because we have a lot of topics to discuss today. Let's talk a little bit

about what happened on the retreat.

00:19:52:06 - 00:20:13:15

Stefan

So, Jens, aside, you're not able to mention the company name due to an NDA, but we are

working on a feature, pre warming cache. Can you kind of tell us like a high level overview of it

and why it's important? And then we can talk a little bit about the reason it's important. A little

hint it's for a very major event that's coming up in February.
