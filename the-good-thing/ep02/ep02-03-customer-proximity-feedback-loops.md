summary: Stefan and Jens discuss WunderGraph's unique approach to customer proximity,
  where engineers directly interact with customers through an on-call rotation system.
  They emphasize the importance of short feedback loops and how this creates happier
  engineers who can see their impact. The conversation covers how engineers are encouraged
  to develop soft skills and communicate directly with customers, creating stronger
  relationships and faster problem resolution.

Jens

Do you remember we had in the very in the very end we had like, kind of like a collaborative

survey thing. Where, where, where we collected like, well, what what are our, our biggest

strengths? Do you remember the, the one thing that that everybody kind of mentioned?

00:08:58:10 - 00:09:02:19

Stefan

I do, But, I want you to say it.

00:09:02:21 - 00:09:28:06

Jens

So, I think one, one thing that stood out. What what, what most of our, employees said is they

really like working in the company. And I was thinking a bit about, like, why is that? Like, well,

what what did we do? So, so that we, we kind of achieved that. Like, we, we didn't really want to

achieve that.

00:09:28:06 - 00:09:52:12

Jens

It's it's more like a consequence of what we do and how we act. And I think it has a very close

relationship with one thing that we hear from many engineers is that before they join us, they

work on some sort of product. And typically the loop between some customer request and when

they release it and when they get feedback.

00:09:52:19 - 00:10:19:12

Jens

This loop, it can be it can be weeks. It can be months, sometimes, years often times actually

never. And there's so often that engineers working in environments where they have like a

disconnect between customer and, and engineering and maybe you can you can speak a little

bit about how how it looks like inside inside Wunder Graph.

00:10:19:15 - 00:10:38:06

Stefan

Yeah, it's a great topic. And I think it's something that really differentiates us, especially as we

continue to scale and get more customers. We want to stay as close as possible to the

customers because I think the relationships we build, are amazing. So the way we currently do it

is per week. We have a engineer that's on call, and this is our on call engineer.

00:10:38:09 - 00:10:57:21

Stefan

And the priority is, is that if there's any customer issues that are segmented by whatever totem

skill that we have, that they need to jump in and support that person, the goal is they first try to

start on it, and then after that, if they need to escalate it, they escalate it. And I think that's super

important. And when they're not on support, they're doing feature development.

00:10:57:21 - 00:11:14:09

Stefan

And what's really great about being a customer of Wonder Graph is that you'll never talk to a

non-technical person. And I want this to go on as we continue to scale and we continue to grow.

But if you work on, for example, the router and you have an issue with the router, you have

direct access to the router team.

00:11:14:12 - 00:11:30:18

Stefan

And what's great is when they push an update or push a change they are directly encouraged.

We encourage our engineers to work on their soft skills and to talk to our customers. And so

they'll tell, I don't know, one of our customers, SoundCloud. Hey guys, we pushed a update to

the router. This was what you guys reported last week.

00:11:30:23 - 00:11:52:26

Stefan

Here are the updated changes. Please test it out and let us know. And I think that feedback loop

of actually allowing our engineers to talk with the customer, it creates this. I don't know what the

word is, but you can tell that our engineers like working at Wunder Graph because they're

actually able to see their contributions and how it affects the companies, and they are able to

get that feedback away.

00:11:52:26 - 00:11:56:27

Stefan

And the shorter the feedback loop, the happier they are. What do you think on that Jens?

00:11:57:00 - 00:12:05:01

Jens

And by the way, don't touch your microphone. But should I do it like you're doing this all the

time?

00:12:05:03 - 00:12:07:06

Stefan

I think it was my jacket hitting it. Is it better now?

00:12:07:06 - 00:12:34:02

Jens

Yeah. No. It's fine. Yeah, I think it's really this, this close feedback loop. And it's also, it's very,

very rare that you're working on something that there's no customer waiting. So, so typically

there's always like immediate demand like the, the market is pulling and yeah we, we we can't

catch up. That's why we're hiring people. And it's really important what you're working on.
