mentions:
  - multiple releases per day
  - Jens' rapid prototyping style
  - Sergiy's code refactoring role
  - financial software testing background
  - red tape vs. speed tradeoffs
summary: The team discusses WunderGraph's startup culture, emphasizing rapid deployment
  (multiple times daily) and direct engineer-to-customer feedback loops. David contrasts
  this with his previous experience at financial software companies where indirect
  communication led to suboptimal solutions, highlighting the value of direct customer
  access.

Sergiy
It always was like Samson on top. And, when you work on the actually GraphQL gateway, it's
quite different from the API gateway or just from regular GraphQL server because you have like
so, so many other like complex things and challenges which you need to accomplish and, to
make work. And yeah, it's really, endless thing.
00:10:49:06 - 00:10:58:12
Sergiy
You could improve it more. And we always have new ideas and, yeah, it's quite, quite
challenging and quite interesting job.
00:10:58:15 - 00:11:29:12
Jens
Sergiy and I, we have this, this internal joke that I keep bootstrapping new projects. And
because, I'm usually, I have a lot of meetings and I'm very time constrained, so I'm, I'm typically
in a hurry. So I build something like rather quickly and, I create, like, not files with 10,000 lines,
but I, I, I don't know why I have a tendency to just add more stuff to the file.
00:11:29:14 - 00:11:53:23
Jens
And then after a while, when it turns into a real project, then Sergiy, goes after my code and he
rips it apart into a, well, maintainable structure. So yeah, I'm like the the little speedboat. And
Sergiy is a bit more, I don't know, he he he, he's like a gardener or I don't know, he, he takes
care of the, of the chaos I created.
00:11:53:23 - 00:12:23:06
Jens
So yeah. But yeah, it's it's it's interesting how long we are already together and, one, one other
question I have is like, you know, WunderGraph, GraphQL, Federation. GraphQL go tools, the
library we're working on, this is what we're doing. But the way or the, the constraints we're
operating on, it's still that we're an early stage startup.
00:12:23:09 - 00:12:45:09
Jens
So maybe, question to to David. What what is your experience so far? What what is unique
about working in an early stage startup? What makes it different from from other jobs?
00:12:45:11 - 00:13:12:10
David
Like, I don't I'm not sure that's actually the correct question, because startups can vary quite
considerably. Of like, of course, our startup is, I would say quite fast paced. I mean, a lot of
startups are, but even then, like we release multiple times a day, sometimes we, we releasing
features and fixes and whatever else, all in just a day's work.
00:13:12:12 - 00:13:40:00
David
It's great to be able to get things out to customers quickly as opposed to having, a lot of red tape
and processes that prevent you from shipping things out. And of course, red tape and processes
are there for the protection of the customer. But, when as long as you have a good QA system,
and the tests in place and such, getting things out so that people can actually use them and get
feedback and whatever is really valuable.
00:13:40:03 - 00:14:06:20
David
And the feedback loop as well, is something that. So in my first in my first job, I worked at, a
financial, testing software, testing financial software. So like the customers with, with visa and
Mastercard and things like that, banks and places and, we would often get tickets on we used
Jira then, luckily we don't use Jira now.
00:14:06:23 - 00:14:31:27
David
No shade on Jira, but I don't like Jira, we use linear, and, we would get tickets in and said like,
oh, Mastercard have asked for such and such a thing. But the actual people talking to
Mastercard, were not the engineers, they were, I guess the product owners or perhaps support
teams were talking to those, and then they would have an idea of the what
00:14:32:00 - 00:14:58:19
David
Mastercard wanted or whoever the client was. And then you would kind of implement that
feature request. But, there was one time I remember where I was actually able to ask, this this
company was actually Mastercard. What is it you actually want for this? What do you want to
achieve with this? And what was in the ticket with the specifications were actually a little bit
different to what they actually wanted.
00:14:58:23 - 00:15:13:29
David
They were trying to solve a problem and they thought that we had to solve it one way. There
was a better way to solve it. And if I was able to have that conversation directly with that
customer, it would have saved, I think, a lot of time, and it would have proved for a better
solution. It would have been a tailored solution.
00:15:14:02 - 00:15:36:05
David
And what I really like about it, wundergraph is that we as engineers have a direct line to not only
the engineers at the customers that we provide services for, but their managers and their
product owners. And we directly get all the feedback, all the things that they have to say about
the product, what works well, what could be improved, and what doesn't work, for example.
00:15:36:12 - 00:15:56:10
David
And we can get that feedback feedback loop directly, get the feedback on the code. And it really
drives you when you know what you're building is being used. And you can ask about how
they're finding it or, and what you could do better or like just even the comment that, oh no, this
is working great. Thanks for the quick fix.
00:15:56:12 - 00:16:19:07
David
It really boost morale. I think it's perfect for the engineer involved. It's perfect for the customer
involved. I couldn't imagine if I ever were to have a join a different company for whatever
reason, I couldn't imagine another space where I would not want to have this exact feedback
direct feedback loop with the customer. I think it's completely is absolutely priceless.
