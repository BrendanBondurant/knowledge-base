Jens
And this top list, we put that in the CDM. And when we start a new router or when a router gets
a new config, we load this top list. We don't yet accept traffic. We load this top list, we warm up
the cache. So we plan all queries, we normalize, we do all this and then we we warm up the
caches.
01:26:23:22 - 01:26:48:06
Jens
And once that step is done, we then have it accept traffic. So that means even if you have
100,000 concurrent users, they never hit like a cold router. And now you could say, well, in your
lab you're never actually testing that. So what you're testing is a warm router where all caches
are filled and that's the easy part.
01:26:48:06 - 01:27:16:17
Jens
But the hard part is we want to continuously evolve our schema. So these are the kind of
scenarios where I think yeah your your benchmarking completely fails. And that's just like from,
from my experience, think about what you're benchmarking and think about like real life stories
and real life, scenarios. So that's just my, my personal take on.
01:27:18:09 - 01:27:22:13
Jens
Benchmarking and audits and, yeah.
01:27:22:16 - 01:27:24:12
David
I know we are.
01:27:24:14 - 01:27:47:10
Jens
We are way over time. Like, but when I, when I watched, the, the the clock like half an hour ago,
like, typically we do this for, for, one hour, but I watch the number of, of, participants. We have
quite a lot of viewers actually more than, than typically. So it seems to be, a topic of interest.
01:27:47:12 - 01:28:11:17
Jens
So we we kept running. We are now getting close to the one and the half hour mark. And so I
want to I want to slowly wrap it up, I have two questions for both of you. Number one, I'm
curious to hear about, like what? What, what excites you about the future of GraphQL and
Federation?
01:28:11:20 - 01:28:24:05
Jens
And why do you think people should join WunderGraph on our journey? Why why should you,
join WunderGraph and and work here?
01:28:24:08 - 01:28:30:14
Sergiy
Yeah. For the first question answer is yes. For the second you should.
01:28:30:17 - 01:28:36:00
Jens
Okay that that is typical efficiency.
01:28:36:02 - 01:28:50:09
Jens
Sergiys end, give me a real answer. What what excites you about this, this, this job, this
ecosystem and why why should someone join us?
01:28:50:12 - 01:29:22:00
Sergiy
Yeah, they will be like, we we always have some ideas, and, we sometimes go just from small
ideas like, this configure subscription directive. It's, rather tiny change. It's not trivial to do it,
inside a composition, but for a user perspective, it looks like, router didn't change. But it's also a
lot of problems, which you actually could hit.
01:29:22:02 - 01:29:49:05
Sergiy
And when you consume API, it's important to have a proper description when you just, use the
UI, for example, to build, to query. Since you need the proper docs, it's very important to have it.
And, yeah, we continuously try to improve quality of life when we, when we, when you are using
the Federation and just by having such bits, you could, improve, a lot, gradually.
01:29:49:11 - 01:30:05:14
Sergiy
And in case you with us, you will have that, that things and you will help in the future. And we
have some other ideas, but, yeah, let's keep it secret for now.
01:30:05:16 - 01:30:16:09
Jens
David, what's what's what's your take? What what excites you about the stuff we're currently
working on? And why should someone join us?
01:30:16:11 - 01:30:35:23
David
I mean, I think I've been lucky that in, I think every job I've had, I've, I've liked to, I've worked
with. But, I really do like the whole team. I work very closely with Sergiy. I work very closely with
you. I work closely with a lot of people on the team, and I like everybody. We're quite a diverse
team.
01:30:35:23 - 01:31:02:13
David
We're spread across different, lots of different countries, continents and cultures. It's great that
we, like all in it together, building something. And we've all and a lot like Sergey, me, Suvij and
nithin, anything. Been here from kind of the inception of Cosmo. We've had new people since
who are doing a great job as well. And, yeah, I, I never wake up in a morning and think.
01:31:02:15 - 01:31:24:20
David
Oh, Lina. Oh, shit. I need to go to work for me. It's like I wake up in the morning, and I'm ready
to, start doing some stuff because I really just enjoy being able to develop things and then see
directly the consequences of those developments, whether whether that's breaking something
or someone being really happy because everything's working.
01:31:24:22 - 01:32:02:16
David
And regarding well, like joining wundergraph, like if you enjoy, solving sometimes like, I'd say
challenging problems. I mean, because essentially what we do here is that we, we solve
problems, we're a problem solving company, and we do that by software. But at the crux of it,
we're a problem solving company. And if you like to solve problems and you like to solve
problems that maybe have never been solved before, then by all means, like this is this is the
kind of job for you, if you like seeing the fruits of your labor in terms of what you're actually
building.
01:32:02:19 - 01:32:20:25
David
And if you like different perspectives, if you want to not only join the space, but actually really
set your footprint so you're not just following, you're actually leading the space. I think, that is
what we want to do here at wundergraph. And I think we're well on the way to doing that.
01:32:20:27 - 01:33:06:03
Jens
Yeah. Yeah. Great. Great insights. And I really appreciate, what you, what you shared about,
federation and, and, I think we learned a lot today about query planning, the, the various
directives, the relationship between, between composition and query planning and all of that.
And like, from my perspective, I would say, what what what brought me to this ecosystem, I, you
know, like some, I don't know, 2018 when I started working on, on graphql goo Tools, I, I was
really just interested in working with GraphQL Asts and transforming them and doing something
with it.
