Jens
I thought that was interesting so that kind of brought me here. And today I see that with
everything we have built, we are leaning more and more towards building collaborative tooling.
So we enable other developers to to collaborate to build APIs together. We, we build tooling for,
for teams to work better together, and to build great internal APIs.
01:33:34:16 - 01:33:43:03
Jens
And, and I think this is it's a very rewarding thing because we, we have the, the,
01:33:44:04 - 01:34:11:25
Jens
I would say the, the pleasure to have so many slack connects with smart people where we build
something, they give us new use cases, we can iterate that. We can make it the tooling better
for for everybody. People can now collaborate better. And yeah, we're doing that in the in a very
fast paced loop. And yeah, no, no, we have great people inside the company.
01:34:11:28 - 01:34:43:16
Jens
We have great people outside the company like collaborating with us, working with us. And it's
it's it's just yeah, it's it's a, it's a joy. And I think we, it's also one thing I would say is when I like,
I'm, I didn't study computer science, so I'm, I'm a self-taught engineer, and I never thought that I
would be able to work in a big company, like, because, who am I?
01:34:43:16 - 01:35:12:03
Jens
You know, my education, and, like, I, I'm not I'm not on the, on the path where I would be
working at an Uber or at an eBay or at a GitHub or Microsoft, because that's smarter people out
there and they have the right curriculum to join these companies. But with WunderGraph. And
because so many big companies use GraphQL federation, we are now in the place where we
have slack connects with many such people.
01:35:12:03 - 01:35:29:00
Jens
And that's it's it's super cool. We're now at this level and we kind of bootstrapped our way there.
And yeah, I think it's it's pretty cool. Like we, we, we cannot work there, but we're actually
working with them and that's I think that's awesome. Yeah.
01:35:29:00 - 01:35:34:04
David
Don't make a blunder. Join WunderGraph.
01:35:34:07 - 01:35:37:04
Jens
Okay. I think now it's time that we shut up.
01:35:37:07 - 01:35:40:04
David
And, you know, the good thing is what what.
01:35:40:08 - 01:35:42:08
Jens
What is the good thing, David?
01:35:42:10 - 01:35:45:13
David
That I'm not here next week. What you are.
01:35:45:16 - 01:35:58:27
Jens
Yes, I am. And, Stefan will be back. So, guys, if you like this episode, you know, we don't do this
bullshit with, like, and subscribe. Like, we like. This is not a YouTube channel. This is just.
01:35:58:27 - 01:36:02:23
David
Like. And subscribe. Ring that bell to make sure you don't know this.
01:36:02:23 - 01:36:31:16
Jens
Okay, but, but but I really I'm really like honestly I'm curious. So the last episodes with Stefan,
it's typically more on the end of, we're talking about everything and we're kind of business
focused more and startup focused. This was very like deep tech. If you are interested in more
deep tech, in more deep federation discussions, tell us over whatever channel you like.
01:36:31:18 - 01:36:44:25
Jens
And we we bring back Sergiy and David I really enjoyed this episode was a lot of fun. Thank you
guys for for joining me today. And yeah, I think that's it. Thanks.
01:36:44:27 - 01:36:52:16
David
So.
