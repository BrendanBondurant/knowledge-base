Jens
I was like in shock because I thought like, okay, I'm now under attack and I need to counter and
I need to react and whatever. Like I still didn't have users or anything, but I thought, okay, I can
get there. So hasura they added more features, they added auth, they added this, they added
that. And, and I just thought, okay, if I keep copying what they do, and I do it a little bit better,
eventually I must get users.

00:07:48:07 - 00:08:13:27
Jens
So my theory was take a competitor, do what they do, do it better, better engineering, better
quality, better performance, better whatever. And you will win. And, yeah, that's a huge mistake
in this, in this theory. What do you think? What it is.

00:08:13:29 - 00:08:37:05
Stefan
I mean, there's a lot there's a lot to go on this is that we talked about this before is like success.
You can't ab wait your way there like you originally need. You, you always will end up needing
an original vision. And so tell the audience what was the mistake theat, you realized? And how
many years did it take you to realize that mistake?

00:08:37:07 - 00:09:10:19
Jens
I think a couple, but it really comes down to if you copy a competitor kind of in a binary way, like
feature by feature, the one thing that you that you should be very careful about is, can you copy
their audience? Can you copy the network, can you copy the brand, can you copy the reach?
Can you copy what people think about this company?

00:09:10:22 - 00:09:39:14
Jens
No, you cannot do any of that. And so the, the, the, the big realization for me is you need to
think about the distribution. And, you know, it's it's a little bit like, let's say you, you, you walk
through, through some, some older grass, it's a bit higher. And when you walk through all the
grass, you know that you can you have to what's the what's the right wording.

00:09:39:14 - 00:10:02:25
Jens
You have to, to, to push down the grass a bit with your shoes. Okay. And so if you, if you walk
such a path through this middle high grass, whatever, you can see the path of a person walking
through. And now copying features, it's kind of easy. You just follow the path of the person in
the front of you.

00:10:02:28 - 00:10:42:22
Jens
The thing is, this person, they are following some agenda and you can copy their features, but it
doesn't mean that you follow their agenda, it just means you are behind them. Like you walk the
same path, but you're potentially not doing the same thing. And I think that's that's very
important. When you think about competition, like for example, if you see us doing similar
things, compared to Apollo, that is because we are in the same market, but we are not sitting
here waiting.
