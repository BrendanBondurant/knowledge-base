Jens
Yeah. So he introduced us to Walmart and, Walmart wouldn't become a customer because, like,
we just started with cosmo. Like it. It wasn't ready, but they were extremely friendly to us. They
were so nice. And they, gave us under NDA. They gave us their GraphQL schemas. So we had
the subgraph schemas of Walmart, and they gave us some queries and they told us, guys, you
are cool, but the queries don't plan like we will not work with you, but something nice.

We give you the stuff and maybe it helps you. And to be honest, this was such a lucky moment
because with this, with these schemas and the queries, we were able to to kind of figure out
how Federation works and then how the Query planner should work to the degree that we
could. Then a couple months later, we could onboard, soundtrack your brand.

They also had a very complicated graph. And I still remember, like, it took us 2 or 3 months to
actually make it work. And they were such amazing people because from the very beginning,
they knew that we have a lot of homework to do, but they they trusted us, and we built a
fantastic relationship with, Frederik and Sven.

In the meantime, we have actually visited them and, in, in, Sweden, we ate meatballs with them.
Like, it's really, really cool, guys. We met them in the office, and. Yeah, like, if you look back, it's
just amazing to see that, like the the the reason why wundergraph and Cosmo today is what it
is.

It's really like, I don't know, you. You cannot plan this. It just happens.

Stefan
It's kind of like life. I always tell all my friends, build the startup. When you're young and in your
20s, you go from 22 to 27, in a blink of an eye. So it's going to go quick. So if you can take the
risk, do it. If you can take the risk any time in your life to build a startup, I think you absolutely
should.

And I mean, there's so much to talk about. But Jens what what's the good thing?

Jens
The good thing.

Stefan
Yeah, the good thing is we're back next week. But who's going to join you next week? Do you
know yet.

Jens
Who's gonna join me next week?

Stefan
Yeah, I'm getting married. I won't be here.

Jens
Oh, you're not here. What do we do? We'll figure it out. Good. Who will be this? This person
moderating and with the good looks. And so I'm here for the for the good input and and
everything. You're here for the looks. But how do we replace you?

Stefan
We'll figure it out, guys. Comment below or on any of the post of who you would like to meet
from the team. Take a look at our LinkedIn. Maybe Bjorn our SEO. We can bring somebody on
for the show, or we might just skip next week, but we'll keep you guys updated. So the good
thing is then it's not that we might be back next week, but also I'm getting married, so that's a
good thing.

Stefan
Thank you guys again so much for joining us Jens always a pleasure. See you guys. Ciao.

Stefan
It's funny it it wasn't letting me end the stream by guys.
