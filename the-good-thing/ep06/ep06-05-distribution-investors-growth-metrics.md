Jens
What is Apollo releasing tomorrow and how do we react to that? Because we really don't care
so much about that. Not in a negative way. Like it's just competition. But what we care about is
so we have our vision and we have our customers, and together we have like a compass. And it
tells us like, what direction should we go?

00:11:05:16 - 00:11:31:27
Jens
And we go this direction. And somewhere near us there might be Apollo, and they might also
walk in a similar direction sometimes. Maybe more, maybe less. We don't know. We're not so
interested in that. It's like, yes, the like the community, the market, it moves in the same
direction because like there compass, it points to north, ours points to north.

00:11:31:27 - 00:12:00:20
Jens
Okay. We're, we're we're walking in in that kind of direction. But just because it looks the same,
it doesn't mean that it's the same. And then coming back, if you just follow some other
companies path and you don't really have that strategy that goes behind just following them, like
your strategy cannot be, let's copy the roadmap and try to get customers at a lower price point.

00:12:00:22 - 00:12:26:01
Jens
That's you're not going to build a successful company. You need to go like, like way beyond that
in terms of of the strategy. And also if you want to be a little bit more specific, think about if
you're building a startup, think about how you communicate, or see yourself in a situation where
you communicate with investors.

00:12:26:05 - 00:13:09:18
Jens
So if you ever happen to raise money and you go to investors, investors, we'll talk about and
ask you questions about, the market and the competition. And you can't just go there and say
like, hey, there's like three other competitors. They are doing X, Y, Z, and we're also doing Z like
you. I mean, for some amount of time, you can you can do this, but if you want to raise multiple
rounds, it can't, it cannot be on the back of we're also doing X like it's going to be tough.

00:13:09:18 - 00:13:34:09
Jens
And then you also need growth metrics and other things. And for that you need the the
distribution. And just walking behind someone distribution can be can be really tough. So that's
my $0.05 on copying your competitors anything. What are your thoughts. Anything you want to
add.
