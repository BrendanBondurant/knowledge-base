And a really good example of this. For example, a really good example of this is super base. So
Super Base started off as the open source alternative to Firebase. It's a great market database
as a service. But if you've noticed recently they raised a series C and they've completely shifted
from open source alternative to managed Postgres which is a much bigger market.

00:14:16:03 - 00:14:35:22
Stefan
Now they're competing with neon, now they're competing with AWSâ€™s new database and they've
always wanted to be in that space. How they got into that space, though, was by being an open
source alternative to Firebase. And the same thing with Cal. So Cal.com is an open source
alternative to Calendly. And they start off just like that.

00:14:35:24 - 00:15:02:06
Stefan
But they've always wanted to be into scheduling and they've shifted completely into a complete
new offering because of their foothold now into it. And so I agree with you one thing though
about that, Jens, is, like people coming into the market like people copying things like that. What
do you think about people copying us? Like, you know, like people say like, oh, with the Apollo.

00:15:02:06 - 00:15:19:23
Stefan
But if you look like we have features that they don't, we're just in the same marketplace. But
then there are some competitors that are just doing what you used to do with Hasura. You know,
you introduce us, they introduce us, we it's like Borat. You ever see that? Like, I get iPhone, he
gets iPhone. We implement EDFs.

00:15:19:25 - 00:15:34:01
Stefan
They can't. We're too smart. No, I'm kidding, but. Well, how do you feel about that? Because we
see it all the time is that we have a copycat competitor. That doing what you used to do with
Hasura, and for me, it doesn't bother me. It's kind of funny to see, but I want to get your
thoughts on it.

00:15:34:04 - 00:15:38:27
Jens
Yeah.

00:15:39:00 - 00:16:10:18
Jens
Hi. Platzhersch, Okay, so one thing on on copying, and I like that you brought up the topic of
open source because, for example, I would say that hasura. Not hasura, that's super base. It's
not really a copy of of Firebase because Firebase, it's a closed source source and super base at
least in the, in the, in the, what it was at the beginning, it's an open source alternative.

00:16:10:20 - 00:16:56:15
Jens
The same thing with, cal.com and calendly the the thing is, if you think about like, like
copycatting or in this kind of negative way, well, one thing, it's just like a post that came up
yesterday after after, Apollo said like, hey, our, our router is now version 2.0. It's now GA one of
the first messages they got on on Reddit as a comment was, yes, but what if a company wants
to to self host, this this router and it doesn't want the, the, the router to call to an online service
because of, of regulations or other reasons.
