Jens
And so if you built, like a Federation tool suite and the router is open source, it's apache2
licensed and it can work air gapped, that's it. That's a complete differentiator. Like yes, we're
doing federation. But one thing like graph OS, if you do subscriptions, for example, what I
consider like, like GraphQL subscriptions, it's a base functionality.

It's not an enterprise feature. Like if you put this behind an enterprise wall and then someone
comes along and builds an open source router and makes that just open source, that's not
copying because it's it's a completely different thing. Like one business model, like, yes, on the
technical side, it's it's it's very much the same thing. But on the business side, it's just two very
different approaches.

And for example, this is, this is one thing I would say it's, it's about philosophy. Sometimes for
us, one of the, one of the key parts, of, of our philosophy is that, actually, I know we we talk. We
talk. Yeah. Okay. We we can, we can transition into into topic two. I know you have this other
question.

We can go back. But for us, one of the key parts in our philosophy is infrastructure, architecture,
infrastructure components. They must be open source. So the router must be open source. And
there must be no feature in the router that needs an enterprise license or that needs to talk to an
external service or some something. Because if we want to own this federation market, then
everybody should see wundergraph Cosmo router as like the default solution.

And so, how do you make the, how do you make this as frictionless as possible? Don't put
roadblocks in front of people that prevent them from using the router. And so I don't know if you
deploy the router in your data center and like, you know, we have Cosmo Managed Cloud and
blah, blah, blah. And like this is what we're selling.

We're not selling an open source router. This is just an open source router. Do whatever you
want. If you don't need anything from us, if you don't care about us, this is fine. Deploy your
router. You leave us alone. We leave you alone. It's open source. Do whatever. But we want the
community to use this thing because we believe if more people use the router, it will be a better
router.

So if more people use subscriptions, we can find the bugs and we can make it better and we
can make it faster and correct and everything. And so if you put an enterprise license on top of
your infrastructure component, it just means you're now reducing, the possibility that more
people can use it. So less people use it.

Less people tell you about bugs and you're not improving it. And we want to have the best
router. So how do you get the best router. Make it free. Let's everybody use it. And the you know
the the business model is not like selling a license for a router. Because honestly, I don't believe
that anybody wants to pay license fees for a router.

You know, look at engine X. Sorry to go on the on the rant, but look at engine X, engine X, it's at
the very beginning. It was the most amazing thing. Like it powered so many websites. Then they
got investment. And the investors obviously they want to have a return on invest. Like hence the
name investors.

So they created like I don't know, engine X plus or some other weird things. And nobody wants
this. Like I just want to deploy engine X like leave me alone. I don't want extra. I also don't want
license because like, I don't like it. So I don't know. Our our philosophy is just yeah, everybody
just use the router.

If you don't want to buy our cloud it's it's fine. Then we need to think as a company. Why is it not
better? Why are we not providing value. And but that's our problem. That's not your problem. So
yeah, that's my my mini rant. Making ingfa components enterprises.
