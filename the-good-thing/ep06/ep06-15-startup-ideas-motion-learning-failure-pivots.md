Jens
And I don't know but you need a data loader. You need batching. You need tests. You need
other things. At the end of the day, if you want to do this right, we need to write some code and
we need to have a repository. And yes, maybe it's not going to take two days, but adding this
one endpoint, maybe it takes a few more days, but then it's performant.
00:50:43:15 - 00:51:05:18
Jens
It's tested like what happens if the API changes. Yeah. You go to your SDL, you add the field,
you open your playground and then it works right. Like, okay, you check this in. There's no test.
Pull request is open. How do I verify that it works? Should I also run it locally and open my
playground and test how?
00:51:05:18 - 00:51:11:03
Jens
Like, I don't know. That's not that. That's not a I don't like it.
00:51:11:05 - 00:51:39:03
Stefan
But let's discuss a little bit. Two topics is one like like our relationship that we have with Apollo
engineering team. And then the second one is regarding how we do it. You said how do we do
engineering. And I think this backtracks to open source is if we were to do something like Rest
connectors, the process that we would do is we would open up an RFC and we would invite all
of our customers to contribute to it, because it's not a quick fix.
00:51:39:03 - 00:52:01:04
Stefan
We're getting in use cases, and people would bring up, hey, like this might introduce the n plus
one problem. Like, how were you guys thinking about that? Hey, how are you guys thinking
about if it's going to be performant and I don't understand or I do understand why, but I won't
say it. This is the benefit of open source is that you get to create these RFCs, and you get
collaboration from all these companies to help you think through the use cases.
00:52:01:06 - 00:52:20:29
Stefan
And so I like that. But I understand you said rant about engineering, but I think it's important to
clarify. We have a very good relationship with the engineering team. We talk with them, they talk
with us. We contribute together. In the GraphQL foundation. We go to the working group.
Everything is basically in very good terms, leadership.
00:52:20:29 - 00:52:40:01
Stefan
they might not like us. I kind of understand why, but that's okay. But it is important to know that
this rant isn't about them as a company. It's a rant against engineering. It's a rant that kind of
bothers us to our core because it should. Maybe it shouldn't be done that way. I don't know that
those are my thoughts on that, but Jens, we are almost out of time.
00:52:40:01 - 00:53:01:23
Stefan
So let me get a couple more of the topics that we wanted to discuss today. Because we have a
lot, but we've done the rest. Connectors, the Krueger Gartner hype cycle. I find it interesting, but
I would love to talk a little bit about startup ideas. How the heck do I generate a startup idea?
What do I do there?
00:53:01:25 - 00:53:14:09
Stefan
Like how did you come up with the idea of wundergraph? How how did how do I if I'm a young
entrepreneur and I want to start a company, how do I figure out startup ideas?
00:53:14:12 - 00:53:42:04
Jens
I think the most important bit is you need to you need to get in motion. So it's a bit like if you
want to get in shape, it's not so important that you do the right workout or that you have the best
gym, or that have you, that you have the best trainer, the most important thing is that you you
wake up and you go to the gym and you do something and do it on a regular basis.
00:53:42:04 - 00:54:10:18
Jens
Just, just repeat, wake up, and then and do it. And, you know, there was this guy, I'm not sure
where I have this from, but if you wake up and you you, learn about the problem that
exaggerated. Yeah. David. Oh, yes. You know, if you if you if you wake up in the morning and
the first thing you do is you make your bed, and then a really bad day happens.
00:54:10:20 - 00:54:39:26
Jens
At least you made your bed like, well, one thing and it's it's a bit the same with, with, how do you
find, success in building a startup? Wake up. Do your bed. So do something. And, figure out
where where the market is. And it's extremely likely, I would say almost like 99%. That's the first
thing you do.
00:54:39:28 - 00:55:10:12
Jens
It's wrong. It will not work. But maybe you learned how to talk to customers. Maybe you learned
how to network or something, and then you're starting to get in motion. And maybe you go to
network events, or maybe you have learned how to program. For example, in my first startup,
which wasn't a success, I learned how to program iOS apps, Android apps and backends and
websites and all this kind of stuff.
