Stefan
In college, by the way.

00:04:55:26 - 00:05:05:01
Jens
You were in college?

00:05:05:03 - 00:05:07:05
Stefan
Yeah.
So I graduated 2000, 19, 2018 of the formulation of WUnder Graph. I was a junior in college.

00:05:07:07 - 00:05:19:29
Jens
Were you still playing football?

00:05:19:29 - 00:05:43:05
Stefan
I was still playing football. I had no idea about GraphQL. I had no idea where my life would take
me. I had no idea that I would meet this man on the internet, Jens from Germany, and that we
would become very close. But I was in college.

00:05:43:05 - 00:06:16:02
Jens
Yeah, well, one thing we we had in common. I also had no idea of graphql. I still don't have it.
But, yeah, we have a bunch of smart people, you know, on, on on the, like on the podcast, or
with customer calls. I just pretend that I know how GraphQL works. And then in the background
we have our we have our team.

00:06:16:05 - 00:06:25:00
Jens
Normal week. Some stuff happened this week that we can talk about. How's your week going?

00:06:25:00 - 00:06:53:15
Jens
But, jokes aside, in the early days, there was a hasura
like, GraphQL wasn't, Apollo wasn't yet like a real big player. There was hasura, and I was kind
of drawn to the idea of auto generating APIs from other data sources. And hasura did this in the
in the very beginning, they still kind of do it somehow.

00:06:53:15 - 00:07:17:15
Jens
Apollo also was on the run, good funding and everything. And at that time I thought if I just add
one more feature from Hasura, then I would also get users, I would get customers, I can build a
business. And then every time Hasura kind of made an announcement or something, or they,
they, they announced that they would publish something new.
