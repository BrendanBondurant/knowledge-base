Stefan
And we're back. Look at that. We already have an audience waiting. Welcome back, ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us for episode six of The Good Thing. My name is
Stefan. I'm joined by my co-host Jens. Jens how are you doing today?

00:00:37:26 - 00:01:08:19
Jens
Today? It's a sunny day in Germany, so, yeah, the kids are outside, outside at some playing
round. Just sent me some pictures. via, whats app? How they are spending some time with, the
sunglasses in, in the sun. So it's great to see that. I think everybody's kind of in, good mood.
We're winding down, and, I would say rather calm.

00:01:08:21 - 00:01:16:05
Jens
Normal week. Some stuff happened this week that we can talk about. How's your week going?

00:01:16:07 - 00:01:35:13
Stefan
Okay, well, I'm in Miami, so it's always sunny. Not to brag, but, it's good. I mean, yeah, as you
mentioned this week, it's been kind of intense, so it seems like we're winding down the end of
the week. It's been a great week at wundergraph and then personally, I'm getting married next
week, so I won't be on the podcast next week.

00:01:35:13 - 00:01:52:28
Stefan
So maybe you can bring Dustin or Bjorn or somebody from our team. But I've been preparing
for that. And let me tell you, I hope to only get married once, so I never have to go through this
again. The preparation for marriage is insane, just like the stuff that we had to set up. And yeah,
that's it's finally nice that that's done.

00:01:52:28 - 00:01:58:03
Stefan
So in parallel with wundergraph and getting married, it's a lot of balancing. But one of.

00:01:58:03 - 00:02:03:28
Jens
Them, you need to be careful what you're saying. Your live, everything here, it will be in the
books forever.

00:02:04:00 - 00:02:24:17
Stefan
That's okay. Like the preparation to get married is hard. I can't wait to marry my wife. Like, I
mean, she's amazing. I mean, I'm super excited for that. But man, if I wasn't in the startup
business, I would be in the wedding business. It's crazy margins. You just organize stuff and
there you go come pay. But yeah, other than that, you know, good week and we have some
good topics to discuss.

00:02:24:19 - 00:02:32:17
Stefan
I wouldn't say that they're drama, but I'd say that there. What what would you say about the
topics we're going to discuss today?
