Stefan
And so the same thing in open source is you just don't commit garbage code and you don't
commit untested bullshit because everybody sees it like it's in public. So being open source, it
forces you to, to to think about some stuff, to think about security. Everybody can can see it. If
you build a proprietary source, God knows what's what's going on because we don't know the
code.

Is anybody auditing it? We don't know. If you have an open source repository. Pen testers can
test it. They can tell you about issues. They can, they can, disclose it in the, in the correct way.
So lots of benefits, I would say, where open source helps you to build better software.

Stefan
I mean, I would agree with all those points, some points that I have on that, the focus, like when
you start off as open source, you already protect yourself against, like you said, from a big
company going, you know what? No. Like we're going to just build our own. And it's backed by
meta. Like how do you compete against that?

You really can't. And so open source is a way to just kind of get it out in the front that like, yeah,
we're open source and I like that. And then the second one is open source in procurement. Like
it's a hack. Like they run a a security audit on it. It goes through and then they start
implementing it into a dev environment and boom you're already there.

If you were closed source one, you would have to solve a really big problem for them to. They
would have to go and ask procurement, hey, procurement, can you talk to Jens these guys from
one to to have a great solution. They would come talk to us. It would take a month for an NDA to
get signed, to set up an evaluation.

And then you know what happens after a month, the developers on a new project, he forgot why
he was even looking at Wunder Graph. And so being open source also helps on the sales front.
And then my final point on open source and just building a company is that or back to the
infrastructure, is that infrastructure usage based works for small scale companies.

When you have no users, it's fantastic. Oh, I just pay for the traffic that I use and I have no
traffic, so it's fantastic. My bill is zero. Oh it's amazing, but this is a trade secret if you want to
get with the enterprises. They are so against usage based. And the reason is, we can't say the
name, but me and Jens we're talking with a really cool guy from a really great company.

Everybody knows this company. And, we were just curious. We're like, so, like, we we love this
company. We all use it. How much traffic do you guys do per day? He's like, I'm not sure, but he
said, what was it, 500 million per second?

And it was a lot.

Stefan
Some ridiculous number. So let's just say 500 million per second, 500 million requests per
second. Do the math on usage based. There's no way anybody in their right mind could use any
SaaS that charges per request. I mean, that bill would be absolutely astronomical. And so when
you're thinking about starting a startup and you want to build for the enterprises, keep in mind
usage based pricing.

It works great in the beginning. But what they want at the end is predictability. And I think the
word that we were missing is exponential. You don't want your cost to rise exponentially. And I
love your example. Yeah, I have 100 employees. We have no traffic whatever. But over the year
we figure it out. We're doing crazy traffic, but we're still 100 employees.

I don't mind paying up for 100 employees, but if my traffic went from 0 to 50 million requests
today, okay, my cost could have, you know, astronomically rise. But no, I think it was a great
point. I think it was a great transition into that. And we kind of jumped one thing. But I want to go
back to this.
