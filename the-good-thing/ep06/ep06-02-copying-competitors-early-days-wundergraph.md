Stefan
Not so much drama. I mean, we're we're not. You we're not here to create drama. We're just
chatting. Yeah. What do you want to start with?

00:02:45:21 - 00:03:09:27
Stefan
So I think we should definitely start with should you copy your competitors? So that's kind of the
main theme of tonight's episode. Or for you, it's afternoon. For me, it's morning. So for today's
episode is should you copy your competitors. And it's a bit interesting and I'll add my context to
it because and you can add it to it as well, because technically we did copy a competitor.

00:03:09:29 - 00:03:13:24
Jens
We're a copycat. Right. Like from A to Z. Everything copied.

00:03:13:26 - 00:03:17:06
Stefan
Okay. Yeah. I mean that's what people say. They're like, oh, like.

00:03:17:10 - 00:03:18:13
Jens
Sarcasm.

00:03:18:16 - 00:03:38:14
Stefan
I know, but people say, oh, you're just a copycat of Apollo. And like, I think today we can set the
record straight. We can kind of give our opinion on that. And then we can also talk about people
that are copying us. And so today's theme of the episode is should you copy your competitors?
And Jens, I think you should tell the story of the early days of Wunder Graph and why copying
your competitors doesn't work.

00:03:38:14 - 00:03:41:24
Stefan
And then we'll just go into it like that.

00:03:41:27 - 00:04:15:00
Jens
Yeah, like sometimes it can look from the outside that you're copying your competitors. For
example, it would be very easy to say, oh, WunderGraph Cosmo it's a copy of, Apollo and just
ping me for it, because we will later talk about, this very topic because we're I would argue we're
in so many ways. We're completely different than we're copying almost nothing.

00:04:15:08 - 00:04:45:04
Jens
We have federation in common, but other than that. But we can talk about it. So if we talked
about the early days of Wunder Graph, I would say this is, this is probably I don't know exactly,
but let's say something around 2018, 2019, maybe, 2020 I'm not sure exactly, but in the very
early days, WunderGraph wasn't even a name.

00:04:45:04 - 00:04:54:07
Jens
We haven't really thought of Wunder graph yet, though there was actually no we. There was just
a Jens. And, I was.
