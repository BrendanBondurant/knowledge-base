summary: Discussion of federation's history, with Stefan noting AI company rebranding
  trends and comparing to previous SDK startup waves. Jens explains Apollo's key innovation
  of entities and composite keys for jumping between subgraphs, while reflecting on
  why federation adoption hasn't been universal despite its benefits for microservices
  architecture.

Jens
And you can even we're experimenting with this. You can even use AI to turn the prompt into a
query. So it's it's pretty easy to do, if you don't do it this way. I think you need to. And we we will
probably see this. We will we will now see, you know, there was a wave of like startups who.
00:23:03:16 - 00:23:20:00
Jens
Yeah SDK. And I think now we will see a wave of startups who help you create MCP servers for
all your internal stuff. And they will they will reinvent parts of Federation.
00:23:20:02 - 00:23:52:23
Stefan
It's well said and it makes sense when you put it that way. It's funny that you said that like the
waves of making SDK because we did that. So we were in that wave. We pivoted, we left. It was
funny. But one thing about AI is every company is shifting to an AI company. And I was actually
talking about this with Dax the other day is, so many companies with AI, like the ones that are
providing the services that are providing the graphics cards, you know, like Nvidia and that are
providing the actual services to help AI companies man they're going to make an absolute
killing.
00:23:52:23 - 00:24:17:07
Stefan
But side note so that's the future of Federation. Let's go back a little bit in time and just talk a
little bit about like how federation came across. Because federation is kind of a new concept.
Would you agree. Like officially Apollo Federation was released in 2019. But federation as a
concept is not that recent, right? It's kind of a new approach to a microservices architecture.
00:24:17:10 - 00:24:33:18
Stefan
And I want to get your opinion on this, and then we'll go back to where we were right now. But in
2018, you were I forgot what company you were at, but you ended up going to a conference and
we talked a little bit about this, but that's where you were introduced to GraphQL and the data.
What was it?
00:24:33:18 - 00:24:36:17
Stefan
The DGS data graph layer.
00:24:36:19 - 00:24:40:27
Jens
At Tyk I created the universal data graph.
00:24:40:29 - 00:25:00:13
Stefan
The universal data graph. And this has been talking about for like 6 or 7 years. And nobody's
actually really done a great job on it, like creating this universal data graph. But talk to me a little
bit about the history of federation. Like has federation been done before? Why aren't more
companies on federation like with the companies that we see?
00:25:00:13 - 00:25:11:06
Stefan
They make sense and they love it and it does great. But why aren't why isn't every single
company on Federation is what I'm trying to get to.
00:25:11:08 - 00:25:11:16
Jens
Right.
00:25:11:22 - 00:25:17:24
Stefan
I think and don't answer like a politician. Don't answer like a politician.
00:25:17:27 - 00:25:51:13
Jens
No, I'm not okay. I think Apollo did a lot of things right. And also some. Mistakes were made
along the way. No. I think the coolest thing Apollo created is this idea of of, of entities. And the
key concept like, you have, you have an entity and it can be it can be addressed with, with the
key or with the composite key.
00:25:51:16 - 00:26:19:26
Jens
And you can jump between subgraphs and then get more data for an entity that's, that's the best
that it's a it's a great concept. I also think starting federation in the GraphQL space was a good
idea. I mean, it was a it was a it was a natural fit from where Apollo was coming from. I think that
that's that's really strong.
