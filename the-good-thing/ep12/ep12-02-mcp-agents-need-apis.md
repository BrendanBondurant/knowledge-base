But for the next couple of episodes, we're going to be having some amazing guests from some
companies that you guys know and use every single day. But today you're stuck with me. And
Jens. Let's start off with what we were talking about this morning. So one of our friends and feel
free to mention him. But he went to KubeCon and he gave us some interesting observations of
what he saw at KubeCon.
00:02:33:26 - 00:02:45:24
Stefan
And just kind of what happens each year at KubeCon. But I don't want to take your thunder.
Maybe explain what did he see at KubeCon? What is KubeCon and what trends do you see the
tech world going into?
00:02:45:27 - 00:03:20:23
Jens
So he said KubeCon was 13,000 people, so probably, quite crowded place. And he also said
that that, KubeCon it's it comes in waves or the topics, they come in waves and, yeah, this year
it's AI obviously. And, the big question you have to ask yourself is if you are, for example, in the
API space, do you actually want to be there?
00:03:20:25 - 00:03:52:24
Jens
It's not cheap. And, if everybody talks about AI and you don't really have an AI topic or. Yeah, I'm
not sure if you maybe if you implement some MCP thing, then okay, maybe that's enough AI,
but, probably people will be more interested in talking to the real AI players. So yeah, I'm, I'm,
I'm not sure that there might be better ways for a company like ours to promote API tooling.
00:03:53:00 - 00:03:57:29
Jens
So that's just, I would say the, the observation.
00:03:58:01 - 00:04:23:15
Stefan
And with KubeCon I mean, 13,000 people, that's that's a lot of people. And then with AI think
this is what I'm trying to understand. So like, I wasn't born, I was born before the dotcom burst.
But like three years I was just a baby. And what I've noticed is history tends to repeat itself. And
so you had the.com boom, and then you had the shift towards, towards cloud, and then you had
a shift towards mobile.
00:04:23:18 - 00:04:41:23
Stefan
And then now we're in this wave of AI that everyone is hopping on it, that you can see every
company is rebranding to AI. Where does AI come in to with APIs like APIs might not be sexy as
AI, but you can't have AI without APIs. Would you agree to that?
00:04:41:25 - 00:05:35:04
Jens
I mean, Anthropic and ChatGPT or, or open AI? I think they might make it very clear with MCP,
the model context protocol. That AI need APIs. And actually, I think MCP, it kind of stands for, AI
is useless if it cannot call APIs. And, like, you know, if you put ChatGPT in the box and you don't
allow it to access to the internet and you don't allow it access to your file system, you know,
cursor is AI with access to your file system.
00:05:35:06 - 00:05:37:05
Jens
So if you remove that.
00:05:37:07 - 00:05:38:21
Stefan
Its useless
00:05:38:21 - 00:06:13:28
Jens
AI to talk to your systems and to the internet. So no system is then I don't know, it's it's just,
really cool thing in a box and it's a toy. I think with MCP all of this rapidly changes and we can
do so many new, new, cool things. And, yeah, I think there's a, there's a big drive in the direction
of, of agents and, you know, like, well, one very clear thing that we observe so far is, you cannot
trust AI.
