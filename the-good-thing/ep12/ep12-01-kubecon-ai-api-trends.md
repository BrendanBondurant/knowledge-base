Stefan
You.

Stefan
And we're live. Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to another episode of The Good
Thing. I'm here with my co-host, Jens, and today we have an interesting episode. We're going to
be kind of just talking about beyond GraphQL, some observations that we got from some of our
friends at KubeCon. AI of course, and just more about GraphQL Federation and just scalable
API architecture.
00:00:41:02 - 00:00:45:02
Stefan
Jens, always a good to talk with you. Welcome back. How are you?
00:00:45:04 - 00:00:47:15

00:00:50:23 - 00:01:15:00
Jens
Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm, I'm a little bit under the weather, but it's fine. At least I can speak again.
And, but today is the. Today is, barbecue weather here in Germany. Okay. So this this podcast
is currently, in between me and the barbecue.
00:01:15:02 - 00:01:18:23
Stefan
Okay. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That's our episode today
00:01:18:26 - 00:01:29:04
Jens
that's fine.
No, no, it's it's fine. Like, it's, I would say, in in an hour and a half. It's it's barbecue o'clock, so
00:01:29:07 - 00:01:41:26
Stefan
You know, I love that I'm a big barbecue guy. I think you know that, like, growing up, my dad
barbecued every day. Not like every day, but like, every other day. And sometimes I would come
home and he is just barbecuing a whole pig. And I was like, why are you roasting a whole pig?
It's like, it's Saturday.
00:01:42:00 - 00:01:52:26
Stefan
It's like, okay, like can't complain, but no, that's awesome. But, thanks for joining us as usual. I
mean, you're my co-host, but one thing. I want to talk to you. I have no choice. Right? Yeah. No.
Yeah. We do.
00:01:52:27 - 00:01:56:05
Jens
We need to do the podcast. Can you come?
00:01:56:07 - 00:02:13:19
Stefan
