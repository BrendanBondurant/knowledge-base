Publicly traded companies are giving access to cursor, to proprietary code, to proprietary
software that they've built in-house. And I'm like, what are your thoughts on the ethics of AI?
Like, for example, like, how are people just giving AI access to their file system, billion dollar
companies that have built up from the ground up on this proprietary software are giving it to a
brand new startup that, you know, just is just around.
00:10:28:03 - 00:10:41:02
Stefan
Like, how can we just give AI access to our code, to our billion dollar ideas, to everything? Isn't
that kind of scary? to you or not?
00:10:41:04 - 00:11:11:24
Jens
It might not be your desired answer, but, actually, I think there's not so much value in most code.
There's value in. We have a bunch of people who understand this code good enough, and we
can change it. And we have distribution and stuff like imagine I, I gave you the code of meta so
you don't have the data but the code.
00:11:11:27 - 00:11:15:15
Jens
So can you now build the social network.
00:11:15:18 - 00:11:16:20
Stefan
I don't have. No, no.
00:11:16:21 - 00:11:41:24
Jens
I mean you would you would have to change people's behavior to move on from meta to meta
one. Or whatever you call it. So yeah, we can give you the code, but maybe there's something
in the code that is more malicious. For example, that can be code, like an algorithm about the
feed or I don't know if people had the code.
00:11:41:24 - 00:12:03:02
Jens
They could somehow cheat to show more more ads or to prioritize ads or whatever. So there
can be harmful ways. But I don't know, I think most code could actually be open source,
because like the the moment you, you open source, it, it's kind of outdated because, you know,
we all have roadmaps like we don't live in the past.
00:12:03:02 - 00:12:28:18
Jens
Like, you know, if you if you look at Cosmo today, who cares? Who cares about Cosmo today?
Because we have a vision for Cosmo tomorrow. So, what is our moat? Our moat is the ability to
create this tomorrow. And we have customers, and we have we have a go to a market, and we
like all of all of this together.
00:12:28:20 - 00:12:55:24
Jens
It's it's kind of like, I don't know our our our our moat, I would say, but just the code. And that's
also why I think it's, it's so harmless to and even beneficial to to make Cosmo open source
because like more people can, can collaborate. But I would say in the, in the ecosystem of
tomorrow, like Cosmo, it will not stay our, our single product.
00:12:55:26 - 00:13:15:22
Jens
So we're, we're building a universe of products and, not all of them will be open source, but,
most and. Yeah, I mean, yeah, do with Cosmo, whatever you want. Yeah. Okay. It's. Well, said,
I, I completely went off the rails. No, no.
00:13:15:22 - 00:13:37:23
Stefan
I, I mean, it's typical. Yeah, it's well said. I mean, there isn't really that much value in the code.
Like, it's everything that you build around the code, the distribution, the brand, the network. And
it's exactly the same example. Is that okay. Like people always say, I could vibe code a
Salesforce in a weekend, like, yeah, you can, but there's no way you can touch the distribution.
00:13:37:23 - 00:13:54:21
Stefan
There's no way you can touch the brand of Salesforce. And so it's not even about the product
anymore. It's about everything around the product. But no, it's a good point. But with AI like and
what we saw in KubeCon and what our friends told us, like at KubeCon is with Federation and
AI and there is no AI without APIs.
00:13:54:24 - 00:14:14:07
Stefan
Where does AI fit into Federation? Where do you see it going and where do you see the
benefits of AI into Federation? Especially for people that are considering adopting the super
graph, people that are considering going into a micro, services architecture where do you see
the benefit of AI? There?
