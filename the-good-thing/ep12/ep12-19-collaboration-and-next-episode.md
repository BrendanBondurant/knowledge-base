Rent.

This is Cosmo's mascot, so this is tricky, but you get out of here. I'm not gonna lie. I think this is
a fantastic episode. So we touched on upon a lot. Next week, we're back, which will be really
exciting. We're going to start bringing more guests onto the show. It's going to be more,
technical focus.

We're going to bring experts that have experience running federation at scale or just working at
hyperscaler companies. I have no closing notes, but, what's the good thing?

Jens
The good thing is we are back next week.

Awesome. Great episode. Thanks everyone for tuning in. Be a little bit more collaborative
though. Pose some questions. Do you agree with Jens? Do you think that he's crazy? You think
he's off his rocker? Do you think collaboration is a stupid and Compute is where it's at now. Feel
free to post your comments into there. Go ahead.

If you. If you don't raise your hand, you agree. Yeah. So looks like everybody. That's fair. I think
we're all in agreement.

Quiet mouths don't get fed. Thanks, guys. See you guys next week we continue.
