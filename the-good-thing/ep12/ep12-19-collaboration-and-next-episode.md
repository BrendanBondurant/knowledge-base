Rent.

This is Cosmo's mascot, so this is tricky, but you get out of here. I'm not gonna lie. I think this is
a fantastic episode. So we touched on upon a lot. Next week, we're back, which will be really
exciting. We're going to start bringing more guests onto the show. It's going to be more,
technical focus.
01:12:20:04 - 01:12:32:20
Stefan
We're going to bring experts that have experience running federation at scale or just working at
hyperscaler companies. I have no closing notes, but, what's the good thing?
01:12:32:22 - 01:12:35:28
Jens
The good thing is we are back next week.
01:12:36:00 - 01:12:51:04
Stefan
Awesome. Great episode. Thanks everyone for tuning in. Be a little bit more collaborative
though. Pose some questions. Do you agree with Jens? Do you think that he's crazy? You think
he's off his rocker? Do you think collaboration is a stupid and Compute is where it's at now. Feel
free to post your comments into there. Go ahead.
01:12:51:07 - 01:12:59:26
Jens
If you. If you don't raise your hand, you agree. Yeah. So looks like everybody. That's fair. I think
we're all in agreement.
01:12:59:29 - 01:13:05:25
Stefan
Quiet mouths don't get fed. Thanks, guys. See you guys next week we continue.
