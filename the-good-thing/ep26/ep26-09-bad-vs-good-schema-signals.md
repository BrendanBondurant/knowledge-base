It's fairly young for a database company, I'll tell you that. Like, if you look at if you look at the if
you look at the true arc of infrastructure, you know, Figma IPOing reminded me of this, actually,
and like I saw, I remember how far along before they even had a product out in the world was
like, what, five years?
00:34:48:29 - 00:35:13:24
Sam
Because they were solving hard technical products. Problem product problems before they went
and built something. Database is the same. Mongo dragged along for a long time. Snowflake
dragged along for a long time. You just it takes a while to build trust. If you're going to build
something, that is enduring. And yeah, like every company wants an exit, it's much easier to get
to that exit when you have a business with good numbers.
00:35:13:24 - 00:35:35:15
Sam
That is additive to any company that went and, and did those things. And obviously it aligns for
everybody, for everybody. But companies are built more slowly than people realize. I think when
we sold github to Microsoft, it was its 13th year. Figma is like ten years and it just takes a long
time and longer than people imagine to go and do these things.
00:35:35:15 - 00:36:05:07
Sam
And the incentives are still aligned. The the chance of you doing those, like, look at the AI thing.
Right? If we'd have just tried to flame out like everyone else and had died before, AI. You can't
catch like if you're dead, right? You just you can't, you can't. You can't adapt when you're not
around. And so when it comes to infrastructure, it's about enduring and building up, something
foundational that people can work with.
00:36:05:09 - 00:36:26:02
Sam
It's also very good for beating out the companies that aren't profitable because you you can be
much more strategic. You just wait like if im in a Postgres market map, I just scrub a third of it off
because they won't be here in two years. They just won't. Right? Like we're already seeing it.
We're seeing it. We've already seen database vendors, just shutting down or running to other
exits or whatever.
00:36:26:02 - 00:36:35:16
Sam
We're not going to do that. We're going to build something that's enduring. And and that's how
we will return the most money to our investors and our employees.
00:36:35:19 - 00:36:49:28
Stefan
Well said. With that in mind, so I remember the blog post, you guys are a series B funded now,
right? C are you guys planning on doing D eventually or is it just continuing the growth the way
you guys are doing?
00:36:50:01 - 00:37:07:18
Sam
We might maybe, but it depends what the options are, right? If we if you don't have to raise
money. I think it depends the problems you have to solve. Right. Like we're still we have a
bunch of technical things that we need to get done, and we have. And we hire engineers, to do
those. And we are hiring.
00:37:07:18 - 00:37:31:06
Sam
We're like hired I think if I like ten people in the last, month or so, so that headcount is going to
sneak up a little bit, but it's great to embrace investment when you're problems now, are like go
to market problems, right. Like you need to reach you want to invest ahead of pipeline and
ahead of of of revenue to go and pull people in.
00:37:31:08 - 00:37:55:00
Sam
We have technical problems to solve right now, and we want to get our Postgres product out of
private preview and then move on to the sharded product. So we may if I try not to be dogmatic
about these things, I try to just do what I believe is the right thing. And if an investment is what's
going to grow the business more quickly and lead to better outcomes for our customers, we'll
take investment.
00:37:55:03 - 00:38:32:03
Sam
If we don't need to do that. Obviously that's a strong thing to do as well. There's so many
companies that just invest massively over their skis because they have to, and it produces a
worse outcome. Like this venture math is you have to get really big, right? For it to work. And if
you don't and you've just raised yourself, you've just diluted yourself out even there's this
founders that could have sold their company for 200 mil and made more money than when they
sold for there's a bunch of billion dollar exits where the founders make much, much less than
they would have made selling even at the first acquisition offer that they got.
00:38:32:09 - 00:38:35:15
Sam
It just depends what you're trying to build and what you're trying to do.
00:38:35:17 - 00:39:09:24
Jens
You know, when you see companies, with young founders raising like 200 million like this,
there's two things I'm thinking about. One is they don't have experience in spending that money
efficiently. And so what are you going to do with the money? And second, there there will be
expectations like that. The exit needs to be absolutely mental. And and at that point the the big
question is will you ever get there?
