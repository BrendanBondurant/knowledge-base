Sam
Yeah. One of our recent new companies is one of the fastest growing companies of all time, and
they're tiny too. And so they don't just bother them, they just want. I think we're getting to that
world right? Actually, where we're seeing more, much more small companies defeating very,
very large ones. And I think people like that and I and it just shows.
00:30:16:16 - 00:30:21:19
Sam
Yes. Clearly impressive. Right. If the small team of people can do what we do, it's clearly
impressive.
00:30:21:21 - 00:30:28:19
Jens
No, you said you you had a surplus, but you're a VC backed company.
00:30:28:22 - 00:30:30:14
Sam
Yes.
00:30:30:17 - 00:30:54:02
Jens
But what what are the. Because I looked a little bit in the, in the past and that was, there was a
moment in the, in the history of planet scale where I think you changed a bit the course you had,
like, marketing people and other things, and you, you kind of changed a bit. And, and for a
moment, I was, I was worried like about the, the future of, of planet scale.
00:30:54:03 - 00:31:33:09
Jens
It was like, Is everything going right? Like it was a weird moment. And so I'm, I'm just wondering,
like your investors, they will also have expectations and, and, first of all, I'm curious about, like,
the there must have been, like, a big shift and, like, as a founder, I'm, I'm always interested to to
learn like how how did that moment build up and and what happened there if you can talk about
it and besides also like now with the, with the surplus, like wouldn't VCs normally say like, hey,
can can you burn more money and raise more and then grow whatever, whatever.
00:31:33:09 - 00:31:36:12
Jens
Like, yeah, okay. Multiple topics.
00:31:36:14 - 00:32:00:08
Sam
I think it depends how your company is being valued. Right. You know, you and if you if you
believe that certain amounts of burning leads to growth. Right. So this is there's, there's this
growth and there's very durable growth. Right. There's you can buy growth. I mean, you just
look at the, we don't do anything silly like post user graphs.
00:32:00:08 - 00:32:29:01
Sam
If any database companies are measuring themselves by user graphs. Very silly because we
have companies that pay us millions of dollars of a year, and they have 3 or 4 user accounts on
the on the platform, they have 3 or 4 people that administrate the database. So user growth for
a database is indicative of literally nothing. But they're connected up to these vibe coding
platforms and they're giving away free computers at an extreme loss to themselves.
00:32:29:03 - 00:32:45:25
Sam
And seeing growth. Right. Well, I mean, is that growth, is that? Is that durable growth? No
obvious is a happy that we've built a successful business and actual business. It's not a
business until it makes money, right. Like when when you when you see more money going into
the bank than leaves. That is a business.
00:32:45:25 - 00:33:27:00
Sam
You have solved. You've conquered really, really tough, problems and built a positive gross
margin business. Even the bottom end tiers of our product are profitable to us. Like you, nobody
costs us money to run on our platform, meaning that every company, every customer that
comes in it, like, contributes to the health of the business. Whereas if you're VC funded, and
burning, you can be VC funded and profitable, VC funded and burning capital really
aggressively to grow or to to get some sort of paper growth that you have to turn into, like real
growth one day, if you're doing that, then it's very hard to know how you'll invert that, right?
00:33:27:00 - 00:33:48:10
Sam
Like and all of these, these numbers that you see of extreme user growth get very muddied
when they're giving stuff away for free on the internet. Right? Like it's once you're giving stuff too
much away for free on the internet, all of your growth numbers are just they don't mean
anything, right? Like it is like, you know, you are not beating Domino's because you're giving
away free pizza outside Domino's.
00:33:48:10 - 00:33:52:08
Sam
You are giving away free pizza outside dominoes. That's that's it. You have not built a healthier
business.
00:33:52:09 - 00:34:21:20
Jens
Domino's at the same time, like, how VCs typically work like they have a they have a fund. This
fund has a lifetime. And at some at some event in that lifetime, they they want the money back.
They want an exit or, or something. And, like being, being profitable in that case it's, it's not
enough. Right. They, they, they will want to see something.
00:34:21:20 - 00:34:30:24
Jens
How do you how do you think about the future of, of planet scale given that it's it's it's not the
youngest, company anymore.
