00:24:16:02 - 00:24:23:06
Sam
Otherwise we wouldn't have the high uptime that we have.
00:24:23:09 - 00:24:39:16
Sam
And then we have a small team of people that build the what they call the surfaces team, and
they build the surfaces that you interact with. They bring the build the the app, web app, the CLI,
and all the other tooling that you interact with to go and use the platform there is like five of
them. So it's mainly all in orchestration.
00:24:39:16 - 00:24:53:25
Sam
There's no sysadmin style people, right? Like that. It's all writing automation that manages the
fleet, continually. Otherwise it would it would not scale. Basically.
00:24:53:28 - 00:24:57:12
Jens
Well, what's your what's your headcount in marketing and sales?
00:24:57:15 - 00:24:58:09
Stefan
Yeah, I was going to ask.
00:24:58:09 - 00:25:38:24
Sam
The marketing is two people, two exceptional people, Ben and Holly. And then we our, our
approach to marketing is very different to most companies. Our sales team is a one sales rep
and two sales engineers, and they basically are both engineers that work with, customers
migrating over, and helping them plan through how to go and do that and, and work through any
kinks that they're seeing on the you know, if you're a very large customer, like very, very, very
large database installed, you spend a lot of time working through making sure you've mitigated
all risks and things work well.
00:25:38:26 - 00:25:48:05
Sam
And we want to do that with them too. And so yeah, they work with that and that's it. It's mostly I
mean it's really how a tech company should be, right. Lots of engineers.
00:25:48:08 - 00:26:00:11
Jens
it out.
So it's all like inbound and people come to you, they say, hey Sam, do you have a database for
me? I have some petabytes of data. And you say, yes, we have something, and then you figure
00:26:00:17 - 00:26:22:27
Sam
We figure it out. Yeah. We don't. The reason we do marketing the way we do is because I don't
think there's much like you go to some, some other companies website and doing infrastructure
and they have all these flashy animations and hypey stuff and I mean, what's it for? Anyone,
any buyer with any money or sophistication is going to want the technical criteria to be put
forward.
00:26:22:27 - 00:26:40:28
Sam
And that's what we do. Like, the way we market ourselves is we do very technical content,
blogging content and whatnot, blog posts are well known for this now, that go really deep into
the kind of things that we find interesting or that our customers might find interesting about
databases or general computer science problems. And that's all we do, really.
00:26:40:28 - 00:26:44:04
Sam
There's no no magic to it.
00:26:44:06 - 00:26:53:01
Stefan
But, Sam, are you involved though? Like, would you say founder led sales? So you have a big
customer that's coming in and you're selling an Enterprise contract. How involved are you in that
process with the sales team?
00:26:53:03 - 00:27:16:00
Sam
If it's a large customer, always very often I'll be the first person people speak to because like,
why not? Like there's only much what else would you do? Like I work with engineering to help to
like, shape how the product should be. From what I'm hearing from customers and speaking to
customers and working creatively with the marketing team, you hear the best things from
customers directly and you learn.
00:27:16:07 - 00:27:39:02
Sam
And I think it's just a good way to do it. Like, I don't hop on a call with every customer. That's
obviously not possible, but it's really powerful to go and work with our large customers and bring
be very sort of human. And I think even even if we were in the billions of revenue or whatever, I
mean, you still want to be working on the largest potential deal you can bring in for your
company.
00:27:39:02 - 00:27:41:12
Sam
So I would always be doing that now.
00:27:41:12 - 00:27:55:06
Stefan
Yeah. Well, sir. And then one of the things we've experienced and I wonder if you've
experienced this is like you've got a typical guy at a very big enterprise and he says, well, you're
only 55 people. What's if you go out of business or something like that. We've also dealt with
that. Have you ever dealt with that while you guys are dealing?
00:27:55:06 - 00:28:06:22
Stefan
These big things are like, well, this company has 300 people in like for me, headcount does not
equal success. I actually think of it as counterintuitive if you have more people, but have you
ever had to deal with that in your sales process all the time?
00:28:06:25 - 00:28:27:00
Sam
And, it's much less of a problem now. But in the early days, oh, for sure, you had to sit. I mean,
you'd sit opposite the CTO of, like, a public company. And I remember one very specifically said,
if you go bust, we go bust. And I was like, and I just there's only one thing you can do in the
moment, which is tell the truth and go, that is true.
00:28:27:00 - 00:28:32:06
Sam
Yes. I think that might be true. What kind of. I can't hide that from, from you. Right.
00:28:32:06 - 00:28:33:03
Jens
Like, did you get the deal?
00:28:33:09 - 00:28:54:04
Sam
Yes. We did. Yeah. you have to be very honest about these things, and, it's less of a problem
now that we have so many large companies running on us, and we're a profitable business,
meaning we don't, you know, for those that don't run a company on this who are listening to this,
if you're if anyone you depend on or yourself are not profitable, right.
00:28:54:05 - 00:29:10:01
Sam
Like, you know, there's a date where your company could go bust, right? Like that's just a thing
that happens. You know, there's just there's such thing as a cash out date that you think about.
We don't really have that right. We have. In fact, last quarter we had a surplus, that was even
more money that we had planned that we were going to have that quarter.
