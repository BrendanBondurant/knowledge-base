Jens
And like, the question is, how much money can you pour into a startup before it just blows up?
Because I don't know, like how do you actually manage 200 million like, I, I don't know, like for,
for us we're, we're, we're quite small still like every hire counts. And you, you think about how
you do things and you think strategically.
00:40:07:18 - 00:40:18:08
Jens
And if you, if you had 200 million, I don't know, we we would have so many people like, I, I'm not
sure if, if that makes sense.
00:40:18:10 - 00:40:39:10
Sam
Yeah. It really depends what you're doing. Right. Like, you just really there's some people that
can take that amount of capital and are in certain types of business where they can allocate that
capital incredibly quickly and put it to work and make it work. Elon being a good example of this.
But yeah, there's some companies that absolutely just explode because the, the there's less
consequences.
00:40:39:10 - 00:41:07:06
Sam
Like when you're when we want to be profitable, we want to be lean. You think about those
things, right? Like you think about how you're going to spend this money and get an ROI from
this money, versus these companies that you see just, like, explode. And then they're all over
with spending 50 grand on marketing videos and stuff like that, and they never really track
whether it comes back and makes anything, and it's fun and it's just like it creates that romance
story that Silicon Valley has and people like it.
00:41:07:06 - 00:41:25:13
Sam
And there's also just too much capital around. This is, you know, there's some of them. It's all on
Twitter about like VC market fit, which is kind of apt. Right. There's you know. Yeah. People I
don't think people I don't think, you know, you see people tout these big rounds in these raisers
and they think, oh, we're too big, we can't possibly fail.
00:41:25:15 - 00:41:46:21
Sam
And there's just a graveyard of companies that were the hottest thing. And then and then went
to nothing. All of these are kind of things we should think about. Meditation for all of us running
companies and to take those things very seriously. All I do know is that if you're going to sell
databases to large companies, you have to be able to communicate to them that you've got a
healthy future.
00:41:46:21 - 00:41:55:05
Sam
And we're luckily able to do that. And good luck to our competitors. So called competitors that
have to figure that out for themselves.
00:41:55:07 - 00:42:10:10
Stefan
Speaking of competitors, interesting question because we're talking about VC market fit. What
do you think of the acquisition of Neon by, Databricks. So they raised over 100 million in
funding. They had a way bigger team size than you. What do you think of that acquisition by
Databricks? I think right.
00:42:10:13 - 00:42:33:09
Sam
Yeah. Great. It's great for the neon team. Was a good outcome. Just agree. Just selling your
products and to to anyone that's paying is amazing milestone. Getting to $1 million of revenue is
an incredible milestone. Getting to 20 million is an incredible milestone. Any company that goes
through these milestones is amazing. But the main one, the big one, is some exit.
00:42:33:09 - 00:42:51:23
Sam
I hate the word exit, but I just keep the camera. I hate the word exit, by the way. Like it just
always triggers me. But yes, an exit or a form of liquid liquidity for your employees is an amazing
thing. So it's great. I'm like, congratulations to the neon team for doing that. It's it's a very hard
thing to do.
00:42:51:23 - 00:43:01:09
Sam
And they achieved it. So I'm I'm happy for them. It puts you know, set some value of like how
valuable growing Postgres companies are. So it's nice.
00:43:01:11 - 00:43:06:20
Jens
Well said speaking of employees, you're you said you're 55 people, right.
00:43:06:22 - 00:43:08:14
Sam
Yeah. Around that.
00:43:08:16 - 00:43:45:25
Jens
Okay. It's not easy to build to to build a company of 55 people that moves in one direction. What
what what is something where you would say, this is something you you as CEO, you
established in your company that that really made the difference. Like, what's it like working at
a, at planet scale and and how do you actually do it that the people, people like it and then they
can perform and all of that.
00:43:45:27 - 00:43:56:04
Sam
Yeah. That's a there's so many layers to that question. I think there's.
00:43:56:06 - 00:44:13:25
Sam
You have to really think about why people want to work at a tech company. Like, can they go
and do the craft and the things that they adhere to do well with this little kind of administrative
burden as possible? And we focus really hard on that. We stay very low in terms of meetings,
low on management overhead.
00:44:13:25 - 00:44:40:04
Sam
You don't have like tons of managers running around. We think very carefully about what it
means to be kind of a functional and performing employee at the company, and we treat our
employees with a ton of respect and, and we have them influence the things that they're here to
influence, and we trust them. It's a very trust based culture.
00:44:40:06 - 00:45:00:07
Sam
We, you know, get subject matter experts for every area of, of of, of what we're here to do and
give them immense freedom to go and do those things we just don't like, kind of micromanage
them. I have run big teams, like the largest team I ran, I think it was about 400 people. And
yeah, I mean, you can do all these things.
