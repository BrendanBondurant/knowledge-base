Sam
We, you know, get subject matter experts for every area of, of of, of what we're here to do and
give them immense freedom to go and do those things we just don't like, kind of micromanage
them. I have run big teams, like the largest team I ran, I think it was about 400 people. And
yeah, I mean, you can do all these things.
00:45:00:07 - 00:45:22:01
Sam
You need to do the performance reviews, the people management and all that stuff. But if you
have a small team of very good people, and fit the culture around that, you can. You can build a
company that people like working out. Like if you work with other smart people that you find
challenging, and then you learn and you grow, it becomes very addictive to go and do that and
have influence.
00:45:22:01 - 00:45:52:08
Sam
And that's the kind of feedback we get from from folks. We do miss the mark sometimes. You
don't hire people, great people every time. And that's why we have one of our values is no
passengers, meaning we don't really tolerate people not kind of being here and working hard
and being present and doing good work. And you have to kind of clean up those types of issues
and let people go and if you're fair about how you do that, then it kind of works.
00:45:52:10 - 00:46:12:15
Sam
Another one is experts, leading experts, which is we believe that everyone should be an expert
in the field, that there are and should be. You want to work for a boss that you aren't, you know
that you respect as an expert. So we have we don't have non-technical managers and things
like that's just silly things like that.
00:46:12:18 - 00:46:15:12
Jens
Are you still writing code?
00:46:15:14 - 00:46:41:22
Sam
I do, but not really anything that goes into the critical path in production, because if I would not
be able to make myself available to, like, be on call to kind of remediate those things. Plus, I'm
probably the worst engineer at the company now. So that's not, it's not a anything anyone's
caught. No one's missing me writing code, but I've done a few, you know, small features or
integrations or add ons for our ecosystem and things like that.
00:46:41:23 - 00:46:45:07
Sam
I'll fuck around with.
00:46:45:09 - 00:46:55:24
Jens
Yeah. Like people are also sometimes annoyed when when I write some code or they joke
about it and, yeah, it's similar. It's fun.
00:46:55:24 - 00:47:16:09
Sam
Like we've had some like niche MySQL issues that, you know, I've been able to, like solve or
just remembered some similar things in the past. And it's always kind of funny when it's me that
remembers that or whatever. But yeah, not a whole load.
00:47:16:12 - 00:47:28:01
Jens
The thing I love the most is, when I get impatient, I vibe code something and then I go to the
guys and then they are super annoyed because they have to get to production ready.
00:47:28:04 - 00:47:47:08
Sam
What's the best way to do it? Right? It's like have come up with something that people sort of
dislike, and then they'll go and tidy up and fix it. One thing I do, do is I have access. The
customers, our customers give me access to their planet scale orgs, and I'll often work with
them as a user and so help them out a bit.
00:47:47:11 - 00:48:02:22
Sam
I like joke. It's like the the most premium tier of support that we have, which is like, I'll go and
mess around with their stuff. And it's a really nice way of seeing from their side how interacting
with the product is and seeing the any pain that we put them through.
00:48:02:24 - 00:48:03:29
Jens
Yeah.
00:48:04:01 - 00:48:05:26
Stefan
That's awesome.
That's that's a good one. Another question I have is, so, vitess open source. It's, Cncf project,
00:48:05:29 - 00:48:16:10
Jens
right?
00:48:16:13 - 00:48:17:23
Sam
Yes.
