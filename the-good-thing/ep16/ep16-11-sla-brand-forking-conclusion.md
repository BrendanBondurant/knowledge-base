Jens
I wanted to bring in some other topics just to, to, to field, to, to complete the discussion. One
part, is SLA, if you, if you copy what we're doing, you need to really figure out how to do SLA,
because if you want to to sell, like to to real enterprise customers, you have to provide them a
SLAs.
00:51:45:17 - 00:52:25:29
Jens
And I think it will take you a lot of energy, knowledge and learning and everything to be able to
provide such a slice. And this other part, this we have a blog of over, 200 blog posts that we
have built over the years, which kind of built a, a, this blog, it built like a knowledge base, but
also a brand, like, also, a lot of people know that WunderGraph exists if they are in the GraphQL
space because they have read one or more of our blog posts.
00:52:26:02 - 00:52:52:25
Jens
You can't just copy that kind of stuff. What else do we have to? Yeah, I think that's kind of good.
And then there's there's one other thing. We have logos, we have opinions. Public opinions from
people who use Cosmo. For example, on our website, we have eBay who is, customer but also
a user.
00:52:52:27 - 00:53:20:06
Jens
And we also have, for example, a very good story from SoundCloud. But we also have have
other, companies who, who use us and you have to ask yourself again, if, if we have those
logos, if we have those stories, how will we now compete with that? And if you then want to win
customers, they will ask you, okay, there's Apollo, they have these customers, there is
WunderGraph.
00:53:20:06 - 00:53:46:11
Jens
They have that customers. What do you have? And so I would say the market is quite mature
already. So it's going to be tough in anyway. But we have this we have this message from
Frankelly. Yeah. Let's read that out. Startups. They often tackle niche pain points over
overlooked problems in clever, tech enabled ways. When they get it right, they can redefine
entire industries.
00:53:46:18 - 00:54:09:18
Jens
And and that's. I very much like what you say here. This is this is really this is also my opinion
that you have a startup. They figure something out in the niche and then eventually they can
really scale it out into like a whole industry or completely redefine an industry or something. And
but this, this kind of movement, it must start in the niche.
00:54:09:18 - 00:54:44:23
Jens
It must start with four or 5 or 6 crazy people who believe in something that, that nobody else will
believe. You know, if you think about our timeline, the reality is the first year was really bad. I
think the second year was a little bit better. And then in the third year, we finally figured out
some stuff. And if you if you would work in a corporate project that cannot show substantial
results in the first two years, I think first of all, the project will be dead.
00:54:44:24 - 00:55:07:11
Jens
But second, if you know a little bit about politics in in, in, in, in corporate world, typically if you
work like for a FAANG company, you get to go for the current year to get to the next promotion.
So you get some like a project within the timeframe of like this year or something where you
have to show the results.
00:55:07:14 - 00:55:21:06
Jens
So like two groups of people have to get fired before you build a wundergraph. So in the
corporate world, it's it's not unrealistic.
00:55:21:09 - 00:55:36:02
Stefan
Guys, we do need to end the episode five minutes a little bit early today because me and Jens
have a meeting. But what I will say though is I really enjoyed this episode. I think we want to
make it part two. If you guys like when Jens is little bit more spicy, which I prefer, please let us
know below in the comments.
00:55:36:02 - 00:55:51:15
Stefan
Because excuse this German if you will, but I think it's much better. I also just learned today.
Hasura gave up on GraphQL? It's very interesting. But next week we'll be back. We're going to
talk a little bit more interesting topics. I still want to bring back open source, because I want to
talk about the importance of choosing a good license.
00:55:51:15 - 00:56:16:25
Stefan
Like why do we choose Apache 2.0 and MIT, how some licenses are weird, for example, BSL
and what the enterprise paywall and stuff like that. But we'll be back next week with another
episode of The Good Thing, and we'll talk a little bit about that. We'll talk a little bit more on kind
of just more about like what would happen if you would kind of fork wundergraph and then, what
what's what's the good thing?
00:56:16:27 - 00:56:19:13
Jens
Before, before this.
00:56:19:15 - 00:56:21:15
Stefan
The medium thing here.
00:56:21:18 - 00:56:27:04
Jens
You know, you said BSL, you know, you know what what this translates to.
00:56:27:06 - 00:56:33:13
Stefan
Is it BSL or is it. Oh yeah. So what does it translate to?
00:56:33:15 - 00:56:36:11
Jens
Bullshit license.
00:56:36:13 - 00:56:39:19
Stefan
Okay. What a way to end the podcast. Well, the good thing.
00:56:39:19 - 00:56:46:20
Jens
Is the good thing is we are we are continuing this discussion in a week.
00:56:46:23 - 00:56:50:20
Stefan
That is so funny. Thanks guys. And see you guys next week.
00:56:50:26 - 00:56:51:21
Jens
But so.
