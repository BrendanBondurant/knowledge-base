Episode 16
00:00:12:22 - 00:00:22:06
Stefan
You.
00:00:22:08 - 00:00:44:22
Stefan
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to another episode of The Good Thing. I'm
joined by my co-host Jens, as always. And today we actually have what I am probably going to
say. My most excited episode, especially because of what's been going on in the news with
Redi's just open source in general, and I just listen to a podcast from an Epic Games founder,
which kind of goes into about distribution and licensing.
00:00:44:24 - 00:00:48:13
Stefan
But Jens, how are you doing today?
00:00:48:16 - 00:00:55:18
Jens
It's the first day where I switched on my my, cooling. Oh.
00:00:55:20 - 00:01:08:02
Stefan
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you guys got spring. It's getting hot over there. So. Yeah, I could tell
Summer is coming to Germany. That's crazy. Because, you know, in Florida year round, we're
always wearing like we always have the AC here on.
00:01:08:04 - 00:01:13:08
Jens
Yeah. So yeah, it's getting hot today.
00:01:13:10 - 00:01:20:03
Stefan
I think today's also going to be a hot topic too. We got some spicy takes. We'll talk a little bit
about open source. I'm really excited.
00:01:20:05 - 00:01:23:20
Jens
Yeah. So you mentioned the podcast.
00:01:23:22 - 00:01:43:07
Stefan
Yeah I mean we can go into but today the topics we're going to be discussing are license lovers,
dual licensing and open core trademark and branding, commercial community. And just kind of
the strategy around a question that somebody asked us was, hey, what's if somebody forks an
open source is Cosmo? Or like, what's if somebody makes a copy of Cosmo, what would you
guys do?
00:01:43:09 - 00:02:02:27
Stefan
Well, we can kind of start off with the podcast that I listened to yesterday. So podcast was, from
Lex Friedman, and it was about the founder of, Epic Games. So the creators of Fortnite and
Unreal Engine, and he is himself a billionaire. And what I loved about him, first of all, is he loves
building games like it's his passion.
00:02:02:27 - 00:02:22:04
Stefan
And he just made a lot of success doing it. And one of the things he said was Lex was like,
okay, like you created something so valuable and you made it basically free, which was Unreal
Engine. And he had such a developer mindset because he was like, you see, I love games and I
love building games. And he's like, I wanted to release that to the world.
00:02:22:11 - 00:02:39:19
Stefan
And he's like, what? I realized from the business point of view is that people building on top of
our platform, it only grows further. So the more people that we can have building and using our
software, the more people that know about us, the more people that could purchase our
products, and the more people in collaboration that we get.
00:02:39:21 - 00:02:57:21
Stefan
And I started really thinking about that, and I was like, yeah, like open source is such a fantastic
way to just get mass volume. And if you think of video game, you know, editors or people
building games like Unreal Engine comes up as number one and it's because it's free, it's
globally distributed, allows indie gamers to start with it, and it just allows people to expand.
00:02:57:21 - 00:03:16:23
Stefan
They go around with it. It's a really, really powerful tool. And he was so bent. And he also had to
fight leadership. By the way, when they got it a little bit more successful because they wanted to
close the licensing of it, but he wouldn't allow it because his goal was if every single person that
plays video games uses Unreal Engine, they're not using our competitor.
00:03:16:25 - 00:03:21:13
Stefan
But it was fascinating. Do you have any thoughts on that?
00:03:21:16 - 00:03:27:29
Jens
Yeah. It's interesting. by the way, do you have at least some some background music?
00:03:28:01 - 00:03:33:16
Stefan
Yeah, it's my mom's alarm clock. Let me get that. While you discussed because I didn't know if
you're going to hear it.
00:03:33:18 - 00:03:48:03
Jens
Yeah I know we we heard but I think one one part that's that's really interesting is when you
when you said if they use our engine, they are not using our competitors engine. Right.
00:03:48:05 - 00:03:57:11
Stefan
Is what I said. But that's was the biggest point for him was that, hey, if we build something big
enough and everybody uses it, they won't use our competitors.
00:03:57:13 - 00:04:30:14
Jens
Yeah, yeah. I think that that is similar to to a thought we have. So we're not thinking in one year
or two years, we're thinking about, let's say, a ten year horizon. So in ten years from now we we
obviously we as a company, we make a bet. We bet on on we bet on Federation. Not like if you
listen to one of the previous episodes, we're not betting specifically on GraphQL federation.
