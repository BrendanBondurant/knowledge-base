summary: |
  Stefan and Jens discuss how market knowledge gained through hundreds of sales calls cannot be copied along with code. They explain how WunderGraph's pricing strategy has evolved through customer feedback and competitive analysis over two and a half years, emphasizing that understanding what customers want, how they want it packaged, and effective pricing strategies requires extensive real-world sales experience that competitors cannot simply replicate.

Stefan
Like, oh, I can just go Salesforce like over a weekend using cursor, you know, as an example.
Sure, you can build Salesforce, but there's so much that you don't know what they've done in
their history of why they've added certain things or build things a certain way. And you'll only
understand that when you actually start going through it.
00:31:39:18 - 00:31:57:08
Stefan
But I like what you said. These developers, they have years of Cosmo experience, and that's
not something that you can just steal. What are some other points though? Okay, so let's say
that I do figure that out. I figure that out. I'm able to run Cosmo. What about like on the branding
or customer side?
00:31:57:10 - 00:32:29:20
Jens
Maybe, maybe one other topic that I think is worth mentioning. We can also talk about branding,
customer and everything, but another topic is pricing. So, there is the pricing we have on our
website today. There's the pricing from other competitors. And then there there is the pricing we
want to have in the future because we're, we're we're changing our pricing.
00:32:29:20 - 00:32:52:15
Jens
And it takes a bit of time and it will have no negative impact on our existing customers. But,
we're changing things because we have learned a lot of stuff. And then there's one big piece.
We are now more than modern, I think two and a half years or something in the business. And
we have had hundreds and potentially thousands of sales calls.
00:32:52:17 - 00:33:23:28
Jens
We have a feeling for what people want, how they how they want it. What's the packaging, what
pricing works, what doesn't work? What do competitors do like? It's it's not super hard to get
pricing from from competitors. And you, you you get a whole feeling of what's going on in the, in
the market. If you take our code, you would, you would, yeah.
00:33:24:00 - 00:34:02:26
Jens
Imagine a few scenarios. Let's say you, you do the exact same pricing, but you know, like we
have more developers who know how cosmo works. So we are faster. At least today. So if you
do the same pricing but we are faster, we're delivering more. And we have a stronger brand
because everybody knows us. Okay. Let's say you have a much bigger brand, but overall, do
you think like do you think it would work charging the same amount?
00:34:02:29 - 00:34:19:28
Stefan
No, it's a differentiator. Like there's no winner in being the cheapest solution. But if we charge
the same and you don't have the logos that I have, like, why would I go with you over
wundergraph? I don't I don't think that there's any advantage there. None.
00:34:20:01 - 00:34:58:02
Jens
And you know, if if you take this approach, you could also think about who could successfully
pull this off. So let's go about different categories of of of people who who could actually do this.
So let's assume you are a startup okay. You are I don't know how much like let's say early
stage. You're like, okay, we build a startup, we take this code and we, we, we we clone that
because we have an idea how to do it better and yada, yada.
00:34:58:05 - 00:35:04:03
Jens
Okay. Can you imagine what happens next?
00:35:04:06 - 00:35:07:00
Stefan
Because I can go. What happens next?
00:35:07:02 - 00:35:16:00
Jens
Okay. Well what does the startup need to do to get started and be able to hire a bunch of
people?
00:35:16:03 - 00:35:18:07
Stefan
Well, they have to have money.
00:35:18:09 - 00:35:20:22
Jens
Okay. How do you get money as a startup?
00:35:20:24 - 00:35:25:12
Stefan
We either venture capital most likely round okay or you go to venture capital.
00:35:25:19 - 00:35:28:28
Jens
Okay. Tell tell me your pitch.
00:35:29:01 - 00:35:38:00
Stefan
Hey, guys, there's this company, WunderGraph. We're going to fork their code, and we're going
to basically build a WunderGraph 2.0.
00:35:38:03 - 00:35:48:00
Jens
Okay. So you have been on VC pitches, right? Yeah. Well what would VC say to this.
00:35:48:00 - 00:36:03:02
Stefan
Where's the market opportunity there. How big is this market. Why. What differentiates you from
wundergraph. Why can't a customer just why would a customer choose wundergraph over you?
It asked a lot of interesting questions, mostly around that.
