Okay. So let's assume you are one a graph and you're pitching to investors. Okay. And investors
will say, oh, WunderGraph. That's nice. So we just raised a series A so not so long ago this
happened okay. So you are wondering if you go to investors the first thing they will say is like
not the first thing but the second thing.
00:36:25:13 - 00:36:50:28
Jens
Okay. Apollo. But Apollo, what about Apollo? Like everybody asks you about competition and
the question about competition. And this is very important. Like early it is like first time founders
in the beginning. They don't get it. The funniest thing is very early first time founders, they will be
like, there is no competition.
00:36:51:00 - 00:36:53:12
Stefan
They said, don't worry about the competition. Yeah.
00:36:53:15 - 00:37:24:08
Jens
Yeah, that's no competition. And if you say there's no competition, what we see here is there is
no market. Because if there was competition it means okay, so market like no competition
means no market. Okay. So then there is competition. Now let's look at the market okay. We
have Apollo and now we're pitching WunderGraph. And the way you pitch WunderGraph when
there is Apollo is you say okay they do this we do that.
00:37:24:10 - 00:37:51:09
Jens
Here is the clear differentiator. And here's what we're going to do in the future with your money.
That really sets us apart. We're building a new category. We are blah blah blah blah. Big story
that tells the, the investor, how do we go from our our investment to, to, 10x that big exit, etc..
So you need to think about it like that.
00:37:51:11 - 00:38:21:25
Jens
There is an existing market Apollo. So it's proven there is a market also. Now you have to prove
to investors that this market is big enough for Apollo and you, or it is big enough for you to go
outside of this category, build a bigger category, or advance into another category or something
that has a big enough term total addressable market to help you 10x their money.
00:38:21:27 - 00:38:48:09
Jens
That's kind of the pitch. Okay. Now now here are you saying, okay, there's Apollo and
WunderGraph and now we're forking WunderGraph and we we do the same thing where where
is our differentiator. And that's up there. Let's go there. Really that's going to be a really hard
pitch. I'm not so sure if if you can if you can pull this off.
00:38:48:11 - 00:38:54:18
Jens
And even if you do, do you know the term tar pit ideas?
00:38:54:20 - 00:39:17:29
Stefan
Yeah, it's it's coined by YC. But for those of don't know, it's an idea that basically is like a tar pit.
You know, you go in there and you just keep working and working and working and working and
you keep working on it and it never goes anywhere, just a tar pit. It's an idea that goes in there
like there's so many of them, like, like a bar splitting up, like an app that allows you to split bills
and it's like, well, what are some of your favorite tar pit ideas?
00:39:17:29 - 00:39:19:20
Stefan
Actually, that's a good question.
00:39:19:23 - 00:39:57:08
Jens
My favorite tar pit ideas. Competitors to WunderGraph. No, but one of the biggest tar pit ideas I
would say we we ever had is, generate it APIs from databases, like, everybody wanted to do it.
Everybody tried it. And, just like 1 or 2 days ago hasura, change their landing page. It is now
promptQL and they, they fully focus on like they, you know, they, they just build their DDN like I
don't know, they did.
00:39:57:10 - 00:40:00:16
Stefan
Data data driven network data.
00:40:00:18 - 00:40:25:00
Jens
Something like that. Yeah. But they they kind of abandoned it. And yeah I, I really hope that for
everybody from now on hasura is an example that you that that we all just end with this tar pit
idea. So please stop it. Don't generate APIs from the database.
00:40:25:02 - 00:40:30:14
Stefan
called.
Don't do it. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think they get rid of the DDS or whatever it's
00:40:30:17 - 00:41:07:02
Jens
Well, there's like a link and you can go back to it. But there's also there's a select, there's a slack
channel where we're like it's called GraphQL community leaders. And there was just a message
the other day that, that, Hasura was not focused on GraphQL anymore. So, yeah, that's one of
the tar pit ideas. But okay, so I think we're, we're we're in the clear that the startup, maybe they
can pull it off, but, I'm not so sure.
