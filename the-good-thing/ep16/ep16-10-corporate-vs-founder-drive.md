But all of this is not relevant. And then in an environment like, like a startup. And so for us, we're
not really hiring those kind of people. And I'm absolutely not afraid. Competing. Imagine I
imagine they would they would clone us. So they would build a team with like the product owner
and then some developers and and who, who would really care about this whole topic as much
as we do.
00:47:00:12 - 00:47:22:07
Stefan
Nobody. And that's the thing. Like, I think we're really lucky. Like we work with some amazing
companies where you meet these people and these big companies from these enterprises, and
you find true people that care, you know, they're true technologists. But I don't think in this case,
you know, like, okay, we're forking Cosmo like, like, okay, I at 5:00, my job ends, I get paid 300
4hundred K.
00:47:22:08 - 00:47:47:12
Stefan
I have some bureaucracy. And so I know because we're we're running close to the end of the
episode is, did you see that tweet, by the way, from this girl? She just got a job at Google, and
she's like, working at FAANG can be way harder than working at a startup. Like, I was just on
call for two hours, post, post, like working shift, like, it's kind of crazy, like, like, people can
compare building a startup to working at Faang in a stress levels.
00:47:47:12 - 00:48:06:02
Stefan
And a good thing is, you should never, like, try to match trauma or stress like, oh, my stress is
more than your stress. Like stress, stress, my trauma is worse more than yours. But I think
you're absolutely right on that front. Which is that working on a big company, it has trade offs.
Working at a startup has trade offs, and you have to just pick which trade offs you want.
00:48:06:02 - 00:48:33:04
Stefan
But it's absolutely true that when you come from a big company, it's harder to change you.
You're more into politics because you've been dealing with politics all year round. And third, at a
big company, it's very easy to coast. If you do what you're asked, you will be employed. But if
you do a little bit more, then you actually get in the tricky situation where you get more
responsibility, maybe not for more pay, but more responsibility, more work.
00:48:33:07 - 00:48:49:12
Stefan
And it's a really tricky situation. I wouldn't say to your point though, we're not hiring from those
big companies. If you're ambitious, if you want to get away from the bureaucracy, if you want to
work on software that impacts developers, and then you want to work on software impacts some
of the biggest companies in the world, I would take a look. At Wundergraph
00:48:49:12 - 00:49:05:14
Stefan
I wonder if you want to leave the corporate card, take a look. I wonder if but if you want to coast,
if you want to talk to bureaucracy, if you want to wait months to ship software, WunderGraph is
not the place for you.
00:49:05:16 - 00:49:12:29
Stefan
Any thoughts on there Jens? Would you agree?
00:49:13:01 - 00:49:38:08
Jens
Yeah, I, I just I just cannot imagine how how would a big company pull it off, how it's such a
complicated project and it's, you know, from the outside it looks shiny. You know, the, the I think
one thing I, I really don't like about being a founder in the public, you cannot talk so much about
the the nuance.
00:49:38:08 - 00:50:02:08
Jens
You know, it's a bit like landscape you have. You have hills, you have like it goes up and down
like founder life is one day can be amazing. Next, next. day can be absolutely horrible. Yeah.
And so what you see in public is everything is going is going good. And but it's not the reality.
It's, it's a, it's a really tough game.
00:50:02:15 - 00:50:37:27
Jens
And if you now think about okay, let's say you build a corporate team ten, 15 people whatever.
And then you have so many seniors with, with opinions and, and, I don't know, it's it's it's
probably going to be tough. And then there's this other thing. Is it even viable? Because at our
current level, I think if you, if you, if you copy us like, I mean, you're, you're instantly also,
competing with Apollo, they are much bigger, much stronger.
00:50:38:00 - 00:51:18:03
Jens
Do you really want to compete with them? But still, even Apollo, for someone like, let's say IBM,
their ARR it's kind of like a rounding error. So yes, I don't know why, why, why even do it? It's
such a tiny market. In the end, it needs to grow much, much, much bigger. But you I don't know,
I think the, the reality is you have these startups, many of them fail, some succeed, and then
they IPO, gets acquired or die and and, yeah, I, yeah, that's that's kind of my thing.
