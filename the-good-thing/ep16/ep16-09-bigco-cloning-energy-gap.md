  Stefan and Jens discuss why big companies struggle to replicate startup success, focusing on the energy and commitment gap.

Jens
And by the way, this is not a time where you pitch like an API startup or a GraphQL startup. This
is the time where you pitch an AI startup, like we are in the age of AI. If you think if you think in
VC investments, it always happens in waves. There was like, the cloud native wave, which has
kind of ended.
00:41:34:26 - 00:42:01:18
Jens
And now if you go to KubeCon, for example, it's all about AI. So now is the AI wave. And if you
want to raise money, just raise money for something AI because that's currently what, what, VCs
are interested in investing. And so I think startup would have it super hard, but who could be
more successful, who could pull it off?
00:42:01:21 - 00:42:02:05
Jens
Well,
00:42:02:07 - 00:42:21:06
Stefan
This is so interesting, by the way, because, it's like, again, I was listening to a podcast on the
way here to Orlando, and one of the biggest ones is there's this guy. I forgot the name of the
company. I'll drop it in the comments on YouTube. But there's this guy that has a $10 billion
company. He owns about 90% of it.
00:42:21:09 - 00:42:44:29
Stefan
It's a very successful startup. It's a big company. And he said, I'm not scared of the big
companies. I'm not scared of our enterprise. Corporate competitors. I'm not scared of them. I
am scared about the group of kids that I don't know. I'm scared about them because they might
be as crazy as me. And the reason why this company is so successful is because of me, I think
about it, I breathe it.
00:42:44:29 - 00:43:00:27
Stefan
It's not a 9 to 5 to me. I'm not a typical corporate CPO. I am a full time founder. And if you
notice, all the best companies that are founder led, they always do more successful. But he
said, I'm not scared of the corporate companies. They're too slow. They don't care. It's not their
bread and butter. They don't live this.
00:43:00:28 - 00:43:15:18
Stefan
You said it like this. They don't live this shit, he said. I'm scared of those kids. I'm scared of the
ones that are like me and they live it. But what do you think? Do you think it could be
competitors? Could competitors could possibly do this? They fork, not a competitor like a big
company. Let's say a big company.
00:43:15:18 - 00:43:27:15
Stefan
Forks cursor. Let's say Microsoft, you know, makes their own cursor or something like that. So
it'd be a big company. But the same thing with Cosmo.
00:43:27:18 - 00:43:34:17
Jens
Cursor maybe, but do you do you think forking Cosmo is attractive?
00:43:34:19 - 00:43:40:02
Stefan
No, not in any sense. I mean, no, I don't think so.
00:43:40:05 - 00:43:44:10
Jens
Like, you know.
00:43:44:12 - 00:43:59:06
Jens
Take AWS, for example. There's AWS Appsync I, I'm yet to meet anybody who's like, I love
Appsync. And there's also what's, what's this other AWS service called.
00:43:59:07 - 00:44:04:26
Stefan
It's AWS is is the async one, but is there another one for APIs?
00:44:04:29 - 00:44:28:04
Jens
Is that there? They have another thing, but not not so important. My point is, I think AWS would
be amazing at running cosmo router as a service. Yes. And actually it would be pretty cool if
they did, because, we're not planning to do it. And then, they, they, they can offer it as a service.
00:44:28:04 - 00:44:54:13
Jens
Maybe we can, we can collaborate on. That would be nice. Imagine you, you click a button in
your AWS console and you have a fully managed, cosmo router in your, in, in your infra in your
network and everything. That's PCI compliant and whatnot. That, that would be nice. But I think
everything else around Cosmo, first of all, it's it's built our way.
00:44:54:16 - 00:45:20:03
Jens
So it's not built the AWS way. So if you would build it with AWS, you you would, for example, not
use keycloak for authentication. You would use Cognito and then you go further and you would,
I don't know analytics. We have clickhouse . I'm not sure if if AWS would have clickhouse or the
other thing. So they they would rebuild that.
00:45:20:05 - 00:45:56:23
Jens
So in the end they, they would end up forking. It's now their own product. And I really doubt that
they, they have the same energy, the same the same drive behind such a project. I think one
one, one piece people have to understand is, when we hire, it's actually very hard to, to hire
people because and we typically never hire from, from like companies like AWS or something
because there's a huge problem.
00:45:56:25 - 00:46:28:27
Jens
These are people who want to get paid three, four or 5 or 10 times more. Then then we get paid
and they are doing, a mediocre job because they understand politics and they understand like
backlog machines and how to, how to drive initiatives. And they, they have learned how to climb
up the ladder and how to to follow the rules and play by the book of, of getting up the ranks.
