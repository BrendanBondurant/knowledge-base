00:29:50:07 - 00:30:16:27
Viola
And it was because the weekly basis rotation was not enough to cover the completion of certain
tickets, because they were complex. They required, you know, additional scoping and, you
know, back and forth with the customers and so on. So the timelines were simply not enough in
that sense. But also there were some tickets that actually occurred over, weeks and months,
you know, back and forth of solutioning and so on.

00:30:16:29 - 00:30:48:04
Viola
So that context switch, which are we talked a little bit at the start of the of our meeting now is, is
were really was apparent to many people on support all the time. I also believe that we were
looking at completion rate. We're looking at how many tickets versus actual bug reports and
feature requests were asked, and just started to make sense to have like a dedicated set of
resources on that particular queries for the customers.

00:30:48:07 - 00:31:13:12
Viola
So we introduced that and it started creating this beautiful atmosphere of silence on a, on a
daily basis where only the relevant ticket would escalate and have introduced the correct
engineers for those particular queries. Things are simpler to resolve with a resolve within the
day or the next couple of days, we would jump on call screen share with customers.

00:31:13:12 - 00:31:53:07
Viola
So. So now the team working on the product is fully, you know, able to focus on product and
while still keeping that connection with the customer because they're not removed from
interacting with them, which I believe is also an important aspect of, working at this stage. You
want to keep the pulse from everyone on the customer, because it drives that, you know, the
empathy, the fact that we know world building for we know the real cases, we know the logos,
then we know where is work, you know, where is our work, making a difference.

00:31:53:10 - 00:32:25:06
Viola
And so, yeah, I think it's, it's an interesting stage. And, we're incredibly lucky to be in this, in this
moment of time with wundergraph, I think is one of the most I think I want to call it addictive
things about start ups, when things start kind of falling into place and you're able to look at the
next phase and introduce this sort of processes are actually making people's lives better,
internally in the company and, elevating product delivery velocity, things like that.

00:32:25:06 - 00:32:32:01
Viola
So, yeah, it's it's certainly one of the most addictive things about startups as well.

00:32:32:03 - 00:32:36:11
Stefan
Okay. So Jens. Do you want to add anything?

00:32:36:13 - 00:33:07:22
Jens
You know, I'm, I'm thinking all the time about the future of the company, like what is ahead of us
and what one, one thing I find crazy about startups is you keep accelerating and while you
accelerate, you have to you have to keep up building the road. So you keep stepping on the gas
and you keep extending the engine.

00:33:07:22 - 00:33:38:27
Jens
More horsepower, bigger tires, bigger gearbox, everything. But the road isn't even there. And
you know, it's it's it's such a crazy thing. It's it's always like a little bit of a whac-a-mole game
where you solve one problem. For example, you you solve marketing and suddenly you have a
sales bottleneck, and then you have a engineering bottleneck, and then you have a customer
success bottleneck, and you solve all of these, and then you have a marketing bottleneck again.

00:33:38:27 - 00:34:10:11
Jens
And you solve that. And I don't know, it feels like an it I don't want to say hamster wheel
because it's, it's fun, but it's, it's also super weird that you, that you, keep expanding and
expanding for the sake of expanding, but, yeah, I don't know. It's it's startups are are something.
But I can say so far it's it's really interesting how you keep reinventing yourself.

00:34:10:14 - 00:34:39:21
Jens
Like, if I think back, like, two years ago, we I never thought that I would be so strategic about
growth. Like, we just had, a founder meeting, and it's kind of like the first time that I'm, I'm
thinking, like, okay, like, on the high level, like, we can build pipeline here. Pipeline there, this,
this, that. And then Stefan goes like, yeah, but if you build this kind of pipeline, you need more
sales.

00:34:39:24 - 00:35:02:28
Jens
And then, if you build more sales, you need to think about customer success. And you some
variables you can just guess and to somehow have to figure out a framework like, okay, how
many customers will we add. And so like it's yeah, we're, we're in such an interesting time, to be
honest.

00:35:03:00 - 00:35:27:22
Viola
Yeah, I know we have great tools, you know, to be able to to forecast that, to be able to build
these models that now even, let's say, 20 years ago didn't exist now. And I always go back to
thinking customer success as a role only started existing around 2005 when Salesforce
introduced the title. But we know it's, you know, as a, as a function.

00:35:27:25 - 00:35:53:21
Viola
It existed in many different forms and many different roles throughout. You know, since we've
been serving software and, what I found fascinating is that now we're able to truly put a number
really quickly without having to spend too much resource on how many, you know, requests we
get from a certain customer, what is their tier, and how much time do we take to resolve certain
queries on a more strategic level as well?

00:35:53:21 - 00:36:21:13
Viola
We can actually also feed back into marketing and product. You know, like what's been the
interest of customers on certain topics and like we need we live in an age where we have so
many good resources at our, tooltip, you know, at our fingertips that we it becomes almost
easier to, to be able to deliver a good experience and also help the company harness that
information.

00:36:21:16 - 00:36:42:03
Viola
So yeah, I think whilst it can, you know, it looks like the hamster wheel is getting bigger and
bigger, I think we also getting, maybe better, engine for the hamster wheel and so on. So, so we
have some sort of support coming in with the right tools. And, I think we have a good stack as
well.

00:36:42:06 - 00:36:48:21
Viola
For this stage, I think we're in a good in a good spot, but, you know, it's always evolving.
