Stefan
I think it was too nice. If I'm honest, it's interesting. Like, Jens if we look back before viola, like,
we went from, like, one customer to 2 to 3 and then to double digits, and now it's just kind of all
over the place. But we always wanted to keep engineering close. And I think that comes from
experience.

00:07:08:01 - 00:07:24:00
Stefan
Right? Jens from working with other people's products. And they had like customer support that
make a ticket and they would just throw. Also, we had a really bad experience with one of our
infrastructure providers where we were like, how can we be on the highest tier of support? And
this is the support you get. What do you think Jens?

00:07:24:00 - 00:07:31:13
Jens
And are we mentioning that it was fly IO, the worst infra provider of the world, or would be?

00:07:31:15 - 00:07:50:15
Stefan
I was trying to be positive, but yeah, it was fly we were on the highest tier of support. They
basically didn't care about us, like at all. Like like no email support, no nothing. And then you
would hop on a call with them. Somebody would come who wasn't technical, they would jot
down notes, and then you would never hear from them again.

00:07:50:17 - 00:08:14:06
Jens
And so but you know, I remember two things from fly and it just it should just make you think
about what, what what what you can do in customer relationships. The first thing I remember
from fly is, that's every couple of days something broke and it didn't work, and we couldn't figure
out why. And the second thing is we had this.

00:08:14:09 - 00:08:25:29
Jens
There was a meeting with a lady who came in, and she asked us a question. She asked if we
removed one feature.

00:08:26:01 - 00:08:59:08
Jens
And, that would break your business. Which one would it be? And that's the two things I
remember. So I don't know, like I said this on I think on Twitter or LinkedIn the other day, if you if
you are a founder or customer success, maybe consider talking directly with your customers,
especially when they are founders, like, you know, founders know how founders think.

00:08:59:08 - 00:09:22:08
Jens
They know the dilemma. They know the problems they are in. Why don't you talk to them like
and one one thing I love about our culture, and this is something Viola keeps. Keeps, I would
say holding, holding the torch. At this time, I cannot join all the meetings anymore. Just it's it's
like too many.

00:09:22:08 - 00:10:04:22
Jens
And I also have other priorities, but we keep catching up with all our enterprise customers. We
we have, like, real meetings, and we even try to meet them in person at some time. Like, it's a
remote culture. We cannot do it so often. But, I think we have we have kind of, yeah, we are in a
place where we, where we, are able to scale and we, I would say the, the framework that Viola
has built it it works and it we, we can keep scaling that with, with customers and I mean from a
product side of you Cosmo, it is not a super simple product.

00:10:04:27 - 00:10:29:06
Jens
And everybody does federation a little bit different. And everybody wants to customize their
router in a different way or different, rate Limiting different. Like everybody has custom
authentication. It's super weird because like most people they have like multiple methods of
authentication. Legacy a new and you need to migrate. And so everybody needs to do some
custom stuff and you have questions.

00:10:29:08 - 00:10:58:06
Jens
And if you just run into viola and she will say, oh, I don't know. But maybe look into the docs.
And next week we will answer via email. That's just not going to cut it. And yeah, I, I like how we
do it. It's still pretty close. Of course we we're scaling a bit. We have a lot of customers now, but,
yeah, also we, we keep expanding the, the scope.

00:10:58:08 - 00:11:05:09
Jens
you hate about it?
Question for Viola what do you what do you love the most about customer success and what do

00:11:05:12 - 00:11:06:15
Stefan
Oh, that's a good one.
