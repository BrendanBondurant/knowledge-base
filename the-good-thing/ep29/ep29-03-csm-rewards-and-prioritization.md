summary: |
  Viola shares the rewarding moments of seeing customers succeed and the challenges of saying “no” to off-mission requests. Jens reframes “no” as a form of service that protects the product’s purpose, emphasizing the need to stay focused on core federation goals rather than chasing unrelated features.

00:11:06:18 - 00:11:33:07
Viola
That's a great question. I would say the thing that I love the most is where when a customer
notifies us, that they, they're live, they're serving traffic, and we are part of that success. So I
think that's a great, awesome moment where we are realizing their goals. We're helping them
realize their goals and getting to that moment.

00:11:33:07 - 00:12:01:16
Viola
I think it's a great win for both them, of course. And in us as an organization that we're part of a
working stack and that we made a difference, you know, in, in getting there, I think that's a great
feeling. And I, a feeling that I always think should be a bit of a companywide feeling, because
everyone is responsible of customer success in an organization no matter your department.

00:12:01:18 - 00:12:24:03
Viola
I think maybe customer success should be a little bit of an umbrella. For for everyone. Because,
yeah, we should all take pride in that. And, and I would say, yeah, that's my favorite moment.
The least favorite moment. I think, you know, it's probably having, you know, a conversation
where you, you have to be managing expectations for the customer.

00:12:24:05 - 00:12:46:08
Viola
I think that becomes a bit of a, you know, you have to figure out how to best manage that
conflict that might arise, because customers really want a feature. They really want to get
something done. And it goes against everything, you know, empathic feeling to be able, you
know, to have to say no, right now, we can't deliver that feature.

00:12:46:08 - 00:13:16:06
Viola
We can't fix this or, you know, we don't have enough priority for this request. And really, you
know, it took me some years, to be able to be comfortable with that feeling. And I think the key
there was to realize that that, no, not now is a favor to the customer as well, because it means
that we are not able to focus on that particular request right now because we have competing
ones that will help make.

00:13:16:06 - 00:13:43:00
Viola
wundergraph even more successful. And in the grand scheme of things, selecting the most, you
know, high priority items eventually will make a cascading effect on the customer itself. So yes,
looking at it through that lens, I think makes it. Yeah. A lot more, more doable. But yeah, conflict,
you know, managing the conversations can can be a little bit of a hairy thing to do.

00:13:43:03 - 00:13:44:16
Stefan
Yeah, I would say.

00:13:44:16 - 00:14:09:03
Jens
So. You know what one of my learnings is, the customer has a job to be done. They say I want a
feature. We know it's not a good idea. And, if you have anxiety, you would just build it. But that's
not the good thing for them. It's not the good thing for us because we keep adding technical
depth.

00:14:09:06 - 00:14:38:05
Jens
And what I realized is they don't always really want the feature. They want the solution. So
instead of just saying no or creating a slack thread and saying no, what works so much better is
build a relationship that is strong enough so that you can hop on a call and say, we cannot do it
right now, or we think we will never do it because we don't believe it's the right thing.

00:14:38:05 - 00:15:04:28
Jens
But we give you an alternative path, and then they will be maybe a little bit upset because they
thought they can get this ASAP and maybe for free. And now they have to do some work. But if
we can explain to them why we don't believe this is the right way. Because if we don't do that, I
think we will just eventually stall the velocity of the company because we add so much scope,
you know?

00:15:04:29 - 00:15:30:01
Jens
Well, one thing I keep slowly seeing is like our focus is, is federation. We are not we are not API
management. We are not an API gateway. We are a federation gateway. And more and more
people come and they ask us to do API management things, and you should just have an API
gateway for that. And it can really.

00:15:30:03 - 00:15:39:22
Jens
Yeah. Result to, to scope creep and it's, it's sometimes it's really tough to say no. Right.

00:15:39:25 - 00:15:59:10
Viola
Yeah. But at the same time, you know what what you're highlighting is the communication. You
know, having that communication exist between you and the customer sometimes is enough to
to really make a difference in their, in our day to day because they're, you know, we have
experience of working with vendors that do not listen to your feedback.

00:15:59:10 - 00:16:28:18
Viola
They dont even give an avenue to be able to give either that feedback or request features, or
just really give a communication avenue to. And and I think with consumers becoming more and
more sophisticated, this is just going to become a non-negotiable. And it's a great differentiator
for us, and for any startup out there to kind of give that path for, for the contact with the
customer.

00:16:28:21 - 00:16:51:00
Viola
I think that's what customer success really enables to do. And if it wasn't called customer
success, but you still had that function, you know, you are still delivering that, you know, that
that connection with the customer and closing the loop. And it's a crazy, you know, crazy simple
activity that you can do. Well, it's highly effective.
