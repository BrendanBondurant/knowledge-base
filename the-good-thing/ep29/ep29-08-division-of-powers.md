  Jens introduces the concept of a “division of powers” across sales, product, engineering, and customer success. The team explains how each function plays a role in shaping direction—balancing vision with customer feedback to avoid over-indexing on any single perspective.

Jens
So I would say, I don't know what is the the, the, the, term in English, but when you have multiple
powers and they have a shared, how do you call it when you have shared power like you have?
You have, for example, politicians and you have police and the power is, is, distributed. How do
you call this in English as a word in German?

00:46:41:04 - 00:46:43:05
Stefan
Democracy?

00:46:43:07 - 00:46:44:28
Jens
No, not democracy.

00:46:45:00 - 00:46:50:06
Stefan
Friendship. So somebody commented.

00:46:50:08 - 00:47:14:06
Jens
Anyways, well, what I think is important. So I'm, I'm, I'm the tie breaker, I would say so I, I think
somebody needs to have the last word because in, in, in a full democracy, sometimes you can
stall and you don't want to have that. So someone needs to be ultimately someone needs to be
responsible for the product direction.

00:47:14:08 - 00:47:46:29
Jens
And that that is me. Other than that, I think it's a super important that you have different powers
that pull in different directions, like you have sales. That's you, Stefan, you have Viola. That,
that, that represents the customer voice. You have me representing the vision and you have
Dustin, the CTO, representing the tech and like technical depth and we have to run it all of that.

00:47:47:02 - 00:48:25:03
Jens
And I think it's good to have like four powers who represent different points of views. And we we
try to find the middle ground most of the time we we can we can find that. And I think it's it's
super important that you have like, this kind of triage process that is not dominated by, by one
force. Because if we would just do vision 100%, it would mean I would even ignore helping
Stefan close the sale because I want to accomplish the vision, or I completely ignore existing
customers and they would churn.

00:48:25:03 - 00:48:53:08
Jens
And so yeah, and with Dustin, you can't just build everything because you can't create technical
debt. You have to run and operate it so that is the fourth pillar, I would say. And I like that we
that we have this triage process and we try to find like where's the where's the middle? And
yeah, it's it's not easy, but so far it seems to be working.

00:48:53:11 - 00:48:54:06
Stefan
I would agree. What do you think?

00:48:54:06 - 00:49:29:15
Viola
yeah I, I, I totally agree, I agree I think I think as I mentioned earlier, we are in such a stage
where we are always iterating, we are always evolving things. And six months things could look
a lot different or kind of similar. And you know, we take it from there. But I think what the North
Star is on top of our values and what we what we want to deliver is that being customer centric,
you know, I think what I've seen from everyone so far has been the great attention to the
customer.

00:49:29:15 - 00:49:52:14
Viola
You know how responsive you guys are on slack, but even on discord, all of that passion that
you have behind the product is actually passion behind the customer. So I think with that, you
know, having that in the mix means that no matter what process we decide to iterate on, that we
have the right motivation behind it.
