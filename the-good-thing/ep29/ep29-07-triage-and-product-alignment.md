00:36:48:23 - 00:37:08:14
Stefan
You mentioned an interesting point, though, like product and customer support. Jens is the
product guy. He's the one that leads the vision on the product. Me and you are kind of on the
ground getting the feedback. Jens is coming into the calls and everything like that. I'm curious,
like, how do we translate like customer feedback? Because we get a lot of it.

00:37:08:16 - 00:37:23:08
Stefan
How do you dig through it and find out what actually can go into the product? And Jens, and
how do you also differentiate from all these inputs from all these customers where one person
wants this, one person wants that, and how does that even align with your vision? Like how
does that work?

00:37:23:11 - 00:37:47:09
Viola
Yeah. To answer my, my, my, my side of the question, we started bringing in a lot of data to bubble it
up to the product team. So during triage, the tickets have things like customer says, you know, I
requested it, but now we're able to see the full bird's eye view of the customer, full of historical
requests that we've delivered.

00:37:47:12 - 00:38:17:15
Viola
We're able to add more information. We're able to also add a bit of that, qualitative insight that
you might get from conversations with the customers that, again, we have time to to capture
either of the, yeah, the context that we're having or via our weekly meetings, monthly meetings
and so on. So it's we're bubbling up that information so that product can do a better, you know,
an analysis of the what's available and then make a decision.

00:38:17:17 - 00:38:18:22
Viola
So, yeah.

00:38:18:24 - 00:38:43:22
Jens
Yeah. Jens. So we have this triage process. We currently do it twice a week. And it's, it's
actually it's a challenge to stay on top of everything that people look into and ask. And I think
one one, one part that really helps us if you can see patterns like it's not just one customer,
wants something, but actually multiple.

00:38:43:22 - 00:39:27:00
Jens
So you can see the, the impact, but you need to have the right kind of tooling that connects all
the, all the dots. So you need to have like the, the customer requests in the customer requests,
you, you need to, to tag like what they actually want. We bring this all together in, in, linear. In
linear we create those tickets, we, tag them with the customers, and then we can kind of see,
like the, the patterns, like one, one great job viola does is actually, figure out, well, what is what's
our duplicate so that we can see, okay, this is something that multiple people want.

00:39:27:00 - 00:39:57:18
Jens
And, you know, the the the easy answer to how I do my job is I have a feeling and I think, you
know, it's it is just like that, like, okay, if I have an idea where we're going with the company and
I, I talk to a lot of customers and they look into all these threads and read what happened and
try to understand what what they need.

00:39:57:20 - 00:40:30:04
Jens
And then, I don't know, I just put it together and then have my own llm in my head where I,
where I get a feeling for what is right and I, I cannot always tell. Like what? Like there's no
ultimate decision or something. But you, you have a vision as a company where you want to
unlock new markets because you say, okay, we want to expand our TAM total addressable
market.

00:40:30:07 - 00:41:04:04
Jens
So you you make strategic decisions, what markets you move into and how you accomplish that
with adding capabilities. And then you have customer requests. And you always have to think
about, is this something that enables one customer is it something that enables five, or is it
something that helps us build a bigger category? And you you kind of try to to level all these
things and figure out what is the, what is the right thing?

00:41:04:04 - 00:41:31:24
Jens
And, it's it's hard. And, you also have to think about the complexity, like, how hard is it to do? Is
it something super simple? Can we do it quickly? And what what is the cost of not doing it? And
will it have a cost? For example, just recently, we had a couple of customers after the one-of
directive was merged.

00:41:31:24 - 00:41:56:12
Jens
We had a couple of customers who said, can you support one of we have a very, very big
project running that, eats up the necessary resources to do the one of directive. So we were
thinking, okay, we can do one off now, we can do it in a couple of weeks. We can do it in a
couple of months or after the big project is done.

00:41:56:14 - 00:42:24:17
Jens
And we kind of figured out that we cannot wait until the big project is done. It's too long. It will
hurt the relationship with our customers. So so what is the point of waiting at all because we
eventually we have to do it. So in that case, you said, okay, it takes us one day and, we we just
do it now because let's make customers happy.

00:42:24:17 - 00:42:54:14
Jens
That's, that's enabled them and that's, that's the very. And you can't do that all the time and with
everything and, but you always have to, to consider the, the big picture and I would say I cannot
teach anybody what I'm doing. It's just you do it for some years you you interact a lot of with
customers and you, you develop intuition and yeah, we have different opinions.

00:42:54:14 - 00:43:27:06
Jens
Like, it's not me being a dictator. We have Stefan, we have viola, we have our CTO, and we all
sit together in triage and discuss like, this is something we do tomorrow or we do later and we, I
think we, we found a good middle ground in working on on vision. versus is working on enabling
customers and I would say, luckily, we are in a place where we were able to expand the
engineering team to the point that our capacity is really good.

00:43:27:06 - 00:43:57:08
Jens
Now. And also the product has matured a lot like we now have. For example, like a while ago
we did a very big pen test. We invested two weeks after the pen test. To fix a whole bunch of
holes. And, yeah, we invested so much. We are working very, very closely together with eBay
who test our router at the highest of the highest scales.

00:43:57:10 - 00:44:48:24
Jens
And, at that level, things that matter. This is, you know, sometimes it it really bothers me when
people post benchmarks and say, oh, our router is so and so fast. When you have someone like
eBay with 100 K plus RPSs, what you need at, in that kind of level in production is you need
observability, you need stability and these kind of things, these are not just empty words,
because observability at that scale means you have to fine tune the cardinality of Prometheus
metrics to the point where it actually works, because you don't want to scrape too much, but you
need enough data to properly observe what is going on.

00:44:48:24 - 00:45:17:12
Jens
And it's, it's it's a process of of fine tuning and these kind of things. This is what matters at scale
and not like, oh, we are fast in the benchmark or something. And, and some people, they, they,
they just tell a story about something that this far from reality like Federation at scale. It is more
than I can hammer a router with the same request with the high RPS.

00:45:17:12 - 00:45:26:03
Jens
There's so much more to it. And, I forgot the question, but Jens.

00:45:26:05 - 00:45:46:21
Stefan
Monologue. But speaking of questions, so there's one question from, somebody in the
audience, Mohammed, are you guys interested in decentralization? What do you think about
that movement? I'm not sure if I understand the question totally, but what I think it means is
basically like decentralizing the process of getting all of this support and how we bubble it up.

00:45:46:21 - 00:46:03:24
Stefan
And I think, Jens, you kind of touched a little bit upon that what the triage process is, that it it
kind of is decentralized. We have different input from everybody. We have from the CTO, from
the product, from the CSM, from, the customers and everything. But I think that the approach
that we currently do is what you said.

00:46:03:24 - 00:46:16:00
Stefan
It's kind of like on vibes, but also with the customers. But also we do have a North Star. We still
have what we want to envision the world for Federation, for APIs. Would you agree?
