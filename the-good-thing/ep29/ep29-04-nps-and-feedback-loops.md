I would agree. Like, for me, like, sometimes I see, like, people are like, oh, like a founder doing,
like, customer success. And it's like, what else should I be doing? Like thank you. You are the
premise. And like in the early days, I didn't understand, like how some companies like fly or
whatever for me was like, what do you mean?

00:17:08:15 - 00:17:26:17
Stefan
Like, how would you not give support to your customers? Like, I understand you have a vision
and everything, but like we have it in our values that if our customers are successful, we will be
successful. So I don't understand why sometimes customer success, like with the company, is
like, it's not like the easiest thing you can do, but if you put effort to it, like you can always do it.

00:17:26:21 - 00:17:39:09
Stefan
And so I don't know, one of the questions that I have, though, how can poor support hurt a
business? Like where have you experienced poor support? And like, how does that differentiate
us and the ways that we give support?

00:17:39:11 - 00:18:04:23
Viola
That's a great question. I mean, for support, I think we we experienced this on a daily. I think
that it's where you become a oh, like, let's call it negative influencer. You know, when you start
talking about, some service or product that you're using there, you're obviously upset with and
you start, you know, not recommending to to friends and family and you start to really become a
detractor for that service.

00:18:04:28 - 00:18:32:20
Viola
And this happens more than we think. And the opposite as well. You have an extremely good
experience with something a service, a software. The tool you start becoming a bit of a micro
influencer in your own life to other people, to colleagues, to, you know, the word of mouth and
recommendations are such a huge, you know, network effect that it's critical to learn how to
make, make work.

00:18:32:22 - 00:18:53:06
Viola
And, I would say, you know, things I've experienced personally, you know, we've all used
software that was not, you know, fit for purpose. We've all experienced things that, you know,
you you wish there was a contact us button that would say, hey, let me just, provide a little bit of
support or ask about a bug i'm experiencing.

00:18:53:08 - 00:19:25:16
Viola
And there wouldn't be any, I you opportunity to do that? I've also experienced, you know, bots
when you're, you know, ask you for a question and you get like, clearly a bot response. And, I'm
actually an advocate for utilizing AI to increase your footprint of support, let's say, with
customers that are in intro tiers, that might not, you know, be able to, afford a specific support
tier and SLA, for example, and so on.

00:19:25:18 - 00:19:51:11
Viola
And being able to, to deliver something that is of high quality like, an AI agent that you've trained
properly and you've got the right, the right implementation with. But if it's done poorly, that can
hurt, business more than anything. And there's nothing worse than answering, you know, asking
something and receiving a completely poor, answer back or no need to speak to a human or all
those things.

00:19:51:11 - 00:20:14:24
Viola
And we have to remember we are serving humans. At the end of the day. And, we kind of lose
track of that, and we can't lose track of that empathic attitude that we need to have when, when,
when dealing with this. So yeah, it will be an interesting thing to to see. But for wundergraph, I
think we have such a close pulse.

00:20:14:26 - 00:20:39:29
Viola
On things we are extremely observant on the data that we currently have on customers. I think,
we recently enabled NPS scoring and within a few minutes of receiving, a score with a
comment, we immediately jumped on it and, you know, analyzed it dissected it, and, figure out
the path forward to get on a call to the with the customer to get even more, qualitative feedback.

00:20:40:01 - 00:21:08:07
Viola
So I think we are in a, in such a special moment of our journey. This is where you guys have
figured out a really hard start. You know, the pillar of the foundation of figuring this funding figure
on the revenue model, figuring out all these really huge questions. And now we are in this build
mode where we can actually focus on, you know, innovating and maintaining a close
communication with the customer, which is a great source for that product.

00:21:08:08 - 00:21:20:11
Viola
Drive. And at the same time learn more, because at the end of the day, we always have to
iterate on this is not, you know, this model today is not going to look like it in six months.
