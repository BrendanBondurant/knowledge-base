Viola
And and I think it's a great, great asset to have because, yeah, yeah, there's, there's no other
there's not a really huge driver out there that can make a company succeed. But the desire to
really fulfill something important for a customer and solve the problem. So yeah, I think it's it's
working really well. And I'm sure we have the right motivation to evolve it over time.

00:50:18:21 - 00:50:23:02
Jens
By the way, the, the word I was looking for, it's, division of powers.

00:50:23:04 - 00:50:27:22
Stefan
Which you said a word, not words.

00:50:27:25 - 00:50:28:20
Stefan

00:50:28:23 - 00:51:04:14
Jens
Yeah. And, one, one question I have for for viola. So there's this ongoing theme of, people who
built AI things, or LLM things. They keep saying that we will have billion dollar companies that
have, like one employee or maybe less than ten. And I would love to hear from from your, from
your point of view, viola, because, I know that one very big topic for you is, is all around
empathy.

00:51:04:16 - 00:51:30:12
Jens
And like I, I have my take, but I'm curious how you think about building $1 billion company with
just AI and like, bots and agents and bringing customer relationships and empathy to the to the
table like, do you think that's even possible?

00:51:30:14 - 00:51:55:29
Viola
I mean, I don't think with the current state of or current state, it's possible to run a whole billion
dollar company, the single person, because simply put, we only have 24 hours. As a founder,
you, hopefully you're going to sleep a little bit of these hours. So making sure that you can, you
know, build an entire product, an entire support stack and figure out the financials and
everything else.

00:51:55:29 - 00:52:21:03
Viola
I mean, just setting up your payment, provider will take months. And to do that correctly, you
know, you can't outsource it to an LLM. And I think to be successful, you can't outsource your
thinking. And therefore you need to build things like, you know, you need to put the graft in and
you need to put the hours in trying to fully understand what you're trying to solve.

00:52:21:06 - 00:52:44:00
Viola
And even if you are, you know, a hypothesis is correct, you know, treated scientifically rather
than putting a problem into a machine and hoping that it will give you an answer that's somehow
correct. And, you know, iterate on that, because we know that it's not, at least for now. It's not
into the stage. Maybe in 15 years will be there, but I think now we have to put in the time.

00:52:44:07 - 00:53:06:29
Viola
And I think that's also where's the beauty of building business, where you can actually spend
time and figure the things that actually matter, not just for the customer, for yourself, for how you
are delivering things, have the full control of what you're doing, rather than outsourcing it
because it's missing are the fundamental, I think, human desires, you know, solving things.

00:53:06:29 - 00:53:15:08
Viola
You know, we are ultimately solvers and I think we can't lose track of that. Yeah.

00:53:15:10 - 00:53:17:07
Stefan
Yeah. Mistake. None like.

00:53:17:10 - 00:53:50:12
Jens
David. My take is not no. So very simple. My learning is the really, really deep insights the most
the best feature request. The, the most powerful insights. You get them by building a
relationship with people, getting them to open up, to almost befriend with you. And at some
point they will start telling you insights about their company.

00:53:50:14 - 00:54:12:17
Jens
And they they don't say like, hey, your playground is broken, but they, they are more like, listen,
Jens we use Cosmo. It's amazing. But we have we have this other problem in the company, like
it's it's so much bigger and you're very close. Maybe you can help us with this thing or with this
process. Or maybe you can automate that.

00:54:12:17 - 00:54:47:28
Jens
And, and and these kind of insights you cannot LLM bot your way to that you have to build a
relationship and you, you you and that works only like human to human. And then I think you,
you get to the point where, where it gets really, really interesting and oftentimes, you know,
people, they, they are not always happy when you have like, zoom meetings and then there's
recorders and stuff and, and sometimes it takes a bar and a beer to really figure out how people
tick and what, what is super important to them.

00:54:47:28 - 00:55:20:05
Jens
And, so I think you, you cannot replace, empathy with LLMs and you cannot replace the human
element. And so I think if you want to really be successful, build a successful company, I think
you need the relationships. So I, I don't believe in this in this whole thing of we llm everything.
We automate everything. I think ultimately, you want to talk to a human and, yeah, that's my non
take.

00:55:20:05 - 00:55:22:12
Jens
David.
