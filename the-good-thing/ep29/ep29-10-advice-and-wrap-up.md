00:55:22:15 - 00:55:38:22
Stefan
None. But, okay, so we do have to, wrap up since we were a little bit late, so we are at the 55
mark while I will ask for the last question, though, advice for the listeners, for people that want to
build out a customer support team like how we have in processes, what are some tangible,
actionable advice?

00:55:38:22 - 00:55:40:19
Stefan
I can give them?

00:55:40:21 - 00:56:07:08
Viola
Okay. So I would say, first of all, interview internally, have conversations with your team. How
are things going? How are how's the support process looking like? From the eyes of who's
running it, if you are not running it, just try to get as much inside because these are the people
that are on the, you know, on the ground, and they will be able to tell you exactly what friction,
what problems, what things are working really well.

00:56:07:10 - 00:56:37:28
Viola
So make sure to gather as much evidence as possible internally. First, try to be there when
customers are having calls with the team. And if you can't be there, sort of like, despite the the
poor support process that we experienced, you know, any note taker is a great opportunity for
you to walk back on this calls, look them back, analyze their the conversations and see what
kind of points of friction there are, the reasoning and the motivations behind her.

00:56:38:01 - 00:56:59:04
Viola
And that's can also be a great opportunity to highlight feedback to your team. For example.
Yeah. Ask for additional questions. You know, go a bit deeper in those questions. If they have
them with the customer and you want to get to a little bit of a bottom of the why. So those are
great. Opportunity and iterate.

00:56:59:04 - 00:57:19:10
Viola
I think that would be the third one. It doesn't have to be a huge process, you know, designed
and ready to go from the from the get go. You can do an MVP. You can iterate, you can, you
know, treat customer success a little bit like product development and figure things out as you
as you move along. What's working, what needs to be improved and constantly iterate.

00:57:19:10 - 00:57:26:29
Viola
It doesn't have to be a huge project project, but it needs to be evolved. So yeah, I would say
those three. What do you think?

00:57:27:01 - 00:57:30:16
Stefan
Jens. Any final thoughts?

00:57:30:19 - 00:57:58:09
Jens
I think it really helps when. So I'm a technical founder. My biggest flaw and Stefan is an
engineer okay. Next joke. As a technical founder, I think one of my biggest flaws in the
beginning is I. Well, I was very much focused on the solution, and I was in love with the solution.
GraphQL. Best tech ever.

00:57:58:11 - 00:58:20:05
Jens
Let's use GraphQL for everything. Talk to your database, talk to whatever. It's always GraphQL.
That's not so good. But what I figured out is it really helps if you build a startup. And by the way,
you can change your point of view over time. It's it's it's no drama. It's fine. But what really helps
is two things.

00:58:20:07 - 00:59:08:08
Jens
If you like the people who use your solution, I think that is really beneficial because it makes
working together much easier. And the second thing is, that you that you really enjoy solving the
problem and then solving more problems for the customer. So if you can build that relationship
and expand that relationship and if you as founders and founding teams and everybody like
employees, if you if you join the startup and if you actually enjoy solving the problem and if you
enjoy solving that for the people who have the problem, I think it makes your life super
enjoyable and it can only lead to success.

00:59:08:08 - 00:59:11:26
Jens
So yeah, that's that's my take.

00:59:11:29 - 00:59:18:07
Stefan
Well-Said. So we do need to wrap up, though. We have lots of meetings today. Viola, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:59:18:07 - 00:59:21:13
Jens
Stefan is making a lot of money.

00:59:21:15 - 00:59:35:02
Stefan
Basically we have lots of sales meetings today, so I do need to run. Ethan is a little bit early on
one of them, so he's taking that for me. Speaking of note taking bots, if you guys just saw pop
up in the slack, we had a customer reference call where somebody was checking out
wundergraph and it's quite positive.

00:59:35:02 - 00:59:51:23
Stefan
So viola, great job on setting those up with the AI notes. Even when you're not there, you're still
there, which is great. So viola, thank you so much for joining us. This is a fantastic episode.
Everybody. Enjoy your Friday. And I don't know if we're back next week, but the good thing is we
might be back next week.

00:59:51:26 - 00:59:54:25
Stefan
Yeah I think we're back next week. With a guest right.

00:59:54:27 - 00:59:58:09
Jens
We have Eric Wilde coming up soon.

00:59:58:11 - 01:00:05:11
Stefan
Would you call him the what. What would be a good nickname for him? The advocate of APIs.
He's quite big in the API space.

01:00:05:13 - 01:00:07:27
Jens
He joined the company called gentic.

01:00:07:29 - 01:00:21:08
Stefan
Okay. Very cool. So next week that'll just be you. And thanks, Jacob. Yes. Next week that'll be
you and Eric. Next week I will not be able to join. I will be flying back. Thank you Nithin. Thanks
guys. Everybody have a great weekend.
