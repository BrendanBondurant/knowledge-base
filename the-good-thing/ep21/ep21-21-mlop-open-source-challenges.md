mentions:
- Datadog/Grafana competitive threat
- market distribution advantages
- LLM API integration challenges
- technical problem solving capability
- founder credentials assessment
- $21 million funding
- business scaling uncertainty
summary: Jens analyzes Mlop's competitive position, noting that established players
  like Datadog and Grafana would naturally build similar LLM-powered incident management
  features with superior market distribution. While acknowledging the team's technical
  credentials and the $21M funding suggesting investor confidence, they express concern
  about go-to-market challenges against well-positioned incumbents.

01:03:13:16 - 01:03:24:07
Stefan
Yeah, yeah. Well done. Well said. Okay, if that was the landing page, I would say, yeah, they are
solving a real meaningful problem are they unique. Are they being outplayed?
01:03:24:10 - 01:03:48:15
Jens
So I don't see this being unique because if I was working at Datadog or Grafana, this this would
be the very first thing I would try to do, to be honest. Yeah. So and then I have if I'm Grafana, I
have more market distribution than, than you. So, my gut feeling is, their go to market will be
extremely hard.
01:03:48:18 - 01:04:11:02
Jens
To be honest. I think solving the tech, like connecting all these APIs and then putting LLM into
the middle and like, I think solving the technical problem, I think it's it's doable. And they seem to
have the credentials that, that indicate they can do it. Can they, can they really scale it in terms
of business side? We will see.
01:04:11:04 - 01:04:25:09
Stefan
And they have 21 million. So all right let's go to a tier list. That was just curious. I'd put coin to be
honest I would put rest in piece I don't know, a 21 million. Yeah.
01:04:25:09 - 01:04:27:13
Jens
They have So much funding maybe.
01:04:27:15 - 01:04:29:24
Stefan
Let's put coin flip. Let's put coin flip.
01:04:29:26 - 01:04:35:25
Jens
But but you know why. Why I would have a tendency and say they say they will fail.
01:04:35:27 - 01:04:38:00
Stefan
Too Much money.
01:04:38:03 - 01:05:02:29
Jens
Two things. First, they have a lot of money. So that means they will move rather quickly and
they will burn super fast. And they have to burn fast because expectations are high. Second,
they are all not in their 20s. They are very experienced guys. So, I don't think they are hungry
enough. I think they all have earned the money.
01:05:03:01 - 01:05:16:27
Jens
They worked at Cisco. They they don't need money. So I don't think, like, if this will not
immediately work out, I think they will just abandon it because they can they can go back to a
safe job and,
01:05:16:29 - 01:05:23:04
Stefan
Yeah,but they raised 21 million. They definitely probably took on secondaries. It's a seed round.
01:05:23:06 - 01:05:28:07
Jens
Okay. We will see the second last one.
01:05:28:09 - 01:05:51:21
Stefan
Talk and lop. Okay. Open source experiment tracking for training ML models okay. LLM
Development dev tool, San Francisco I think this is a YC company. Can you go back up to see
which one was YC. So we know for the last three. So yes, Ciroos not. But the last two are okay.
This one's going to be cool because it's dev tools.
01:05:51:21 - 01:06:14:25
Stefan
We like dev tools. Backed by Y Combinator x 25. So they're in their spring batch. X 25 is all
about AI. The ML ops platform built for modern teams. The open source way. Which is it, the
MLOps platform or the open source platform? The open source platform. They copy our landing
page. We need to change that the open source platform for tracking, optimizing, collaborating
on machine learning experience.
