mentions:
- comic book style limiting enterprise appeal
- AI agent market overcrowding
- OpenAI's deep research advantage
- ChatGPT tool integrations
- social media automation concerns
- coin flip tier placement
- MCP integration for AI applications
summary: Stefan and Jens complete their Marblism evaluation, agreeing on problem-solving
  but disagreeing on differentiation. Stefan sees unique positioning while Jens considers
  it a thin AI wrapper. With AI agent market saturation and OpenAI's deep research
  advantage in tool integrations, they place Marblism in the "coin flip" tier. They
  transition to Klavis, which focuses on MCP integration for AI applications in the
  dev tools space.

Jens
Yeah, I agree, like I I'm not sure where I would put it, like how burning it is and stuff, but it's it's
clear what problem they solve. I get it the different personas. I like the execution. What do you
think about the differentiation other unique.
00:23:40:20 - 00:23:49:18
Stefan
I think they are. I think the way that they spun the angle and like, they have it like cartoony and
hiring your AI staff, I think it's really unique.
00:23:49:21 - 00:24:21:08
Jens
I disagree on this because if you if you look again here on the demo. What they really do is I
have five chats and each chat is an agent that has a system prompt and some tools and that
does some stuff, and then they maybe have an integration with the email and whatnot. the tech
is pretty simple.
00:24:21:10 - 00:24:31:28
Jens
very, very thin.
So I, I really don't see the moat that, that is, I don't want to say it's, an AI wrapper, but it's, it's
00:24:32:01 - 00:24:41:08
Stefan
I would disagree here though the comic book feel is cool but I don't think that their audience is
enterprise. I think it's small to medium sized businesses.
00:24:41:11 - 00:24:52:04
Jens
Yeah, I, I think Stefan, David has a point that with, with the comic style, you're definitely not
pitching this to enterprise.
00:24:52:06 - 00:24:57:26
Stefan
Yeah, let's rank them. Gut feeling. So we we.
00:24:57:28 - 00:25:02:24
Jens
We disagree here. That's fine. Gut feeling, is this going to work out?
00:25:02:26 - 00:25:23:10
Stefan
So I have a friend building in this space. He knows five other people building in this space,
which is AI agents or AI employees. I think that there's so many AI agents, AI employees, I put
them in the middle tier. I don't know if it's going to work out because there's so many in this
space. What about you?
00:25:23:12 - 00:25:50:24
Jens
Doesn't work out. And second, open AI will nuke the shit out of this. And I tell you why there is
deep research you just can't compete with, with the, market reach of OpenAI. They have deep
research, and deep research has tools. And in deep research you can just click a button and
connect your, your, Google your email.
00:25:50:26 - 00:26:14:03
Jens
You can connect your Google Drive. And if you figure out it's a good prompt, it does this stuff
like and in the future there will also be connections to social media and others and with the right
prompt it can also do your social media. So, I, I don't see them succeeding long term.
00:26:14:05 - 00:26:20:02
Stefan
Are you going to connect it to your Instagram?
00:26:20:04 - 00:26:21:09
Stefan
I know where.
00:26:21:09 - 00:26:22:23
Jens
You're going with this.
00:26:22:25 - 00:26:24:03
Stefan
So okay.
00:26:24:08 - 00:26:28:22
Jens
Like my wife, my wife has Instagram.
00:26:28:24 - 00:26:35:05
Stefan
I wouldn’t put them in rest in peace. I’d put them in coin flip. Would you agree?
00:26:35:08 - 00:26:43:01
Jens
We definitely should differentiate, the, the trash bin from from this company. Yes.
00:26:43:04 - 00:27:08:12
Stefan
Okay. Cool. So we'll put them into coin flip for now. I think that they might get acquired, they
might have some success, but they are definitely not in the trash bin for now. Very cool concept,
very difficult. Yep. Next one. Yep. Klavis mcp integration for AI applications. Okay, this one is
going to be interesting because it's in dev tools and infrastructure.
