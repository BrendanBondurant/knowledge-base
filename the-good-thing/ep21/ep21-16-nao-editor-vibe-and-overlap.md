summary: |
  Stefan and Jens conclude Nao is "dead in the water" due to Cursor's equivalent capabilities at the same $30 price point. Stefan mocks the "data vibing" terminology as inappropriate for sensitive customer data. They predict major IDEs will soon offer database integration, making Nao's differentiation temporary. After placing Nao in RIP tier, they transition to Amy with humility about their predictions, acknowledging 99% startup failure rates and inviting founders to "roast" their evaluations in future years.

Jens
Okay. pricing, pricing 30 bucks.
00:48:10:29 - 00:48:22:09
Stefan
. Yeah, it's the same price as cursor. I don't know dude. I think they're dead in the water. Like
this is an extremely.
00:48:22:12 - 00:48:27:20
Stefan
let's go to the tier list.
00:48:27:22 - 00:48:32:23
Jens
Okay.
00:48:32:25 - 00:48:35:12
Jens
are they solving a real meaningful problem.
00:48:35:14 - 00:48:46:26
Stefan
I don't think so. It looks like. Well, yeah, the problem's real, but cursor solve this problem. Like, I
didn't see any differentiator.
00:48:46:28 - 00:48:53:03
Stefan
Like, I feel like the problem is super specialized. Like. But why can't you just use cursor if you're
on a data team or if you're a data engineer.
00:48:53:03 - 00:49:08:09
Jens
Terms of differentiation, like I'm pretty sure that very soon we will see like JetBrains and
VSCode and you name them, they will all be able to talk to the database. So my gut feeling is
not so positive.
00:49:08:12 - 00:49:26:17
Stefan
The data vibing part made me laugh too like, I feel like that's the one thing you should not be
vibing with is like your data or your customer's data or like really should not be vibing with your
customers information. Oh God, that would terrify me. Okay, will, open AI, nuke it. I mean, they
just bought wind surf, so yeah.
00:49:26:20 - 00:49:51:02
Stefan
Okay, let's go to the list. Sorry guys. It's dead in the water. And by the way, none of this is meant
like, this is all just in good fun. Like, the fun thing about startups is, like, 99% of the time. You're
right. So any of these could possibly become a unicorn. This is just our fun opinion. So if you're
watching this from now or any of these, feel free to make a list of ours and roast us.
00:49:51:04 - 00:49:55:19
Jens
In a couple of years. You will laugh about how dumb we are.
00:49:55:22 - 00:49:58:08
Stefan
Imagine all of these become unicorns.
00:49:58:10 - 00:49:59:03
Jens
Yes.
00:49:59:05 - 00:50:25:00
Stefan
Okay, okay, so Amy is not, the, is not YC backed venture capital. Okay. Finance San Francisco.
Good start. The AI agent for private market investors. Okay. Oh, I actually saw this video. Hold
up. I actually think I know which company this is. This one is a beast. Actually, I've actually seen
this one. What's wrong with your website?
00:50:25:00 - 00:50:27:14
Stefan
Why is nothing loading.
00:50:27:17 - 00:50:30:27
Jens
It's loading. It's all there.
00:50:30:29 - 00:50:36:24
Stefan
Okay, I know that they raised a crap ton of money.
00:50:36:27 - 00:50:51:03
Stefan
Okay, so she does all of it. What she's doing is she's reaching out. She basically does what an
associate does for a VC firm.
