Jens
They are just not good at creating startups. So, maybe these smart people can put the ego
aside and, yeah, try a different approach. So that that will OpenAI nuke it? I don't think that's
OpenAI. will attack automated testing. I don't think they they care about such a such a tiny
market compared to let's do AI for everybody.
00:13:32:06 - 00:13:39:13
Stefan
I agree, but follow up question though, could AI nuke it?
00:13:39:16 - 00:13:42:17
Stefan
I think OpenAI, if they want it to go into this market, they could, but.
00:13:42:17 - 00:13:55:13
Jens
I don't think so. By the way. Put put the put the put the thing from here. I cannot can I click on
this show, yes. Jens. Founder said I think startup founders are smart.
00:13:55:15 - 00:13:58:26
Stefan
Yeah. Of course.
00:13:58:28 - 00:14:00:06
Stefan
No, I.
00:14:00:09 - 00:14:13:19
Jens
Said that because I also have empathy. You know, if you if you look at the WUnderGraph
website in the time back machine, at the very early days, you will see how much I sucked. So,
yeah.
00:14:13:21 - 00:14:30:21
Stefan
But that's the whole point of any founder, by the way, is you embrace the suck like you're
supposed to suck. Startups are the most counter-intuitive thing in the world that every time you
think you're doing something right, you learn, oh wait I'm doing everything wrong. So feedback
is a gift. Take it or leave it if you like it. Do whatever.
00:14:30:23 - 00:14:49:10
Jens
Here's my here's my feedback what they can do. So these are smart guys maybe. And they
found that I can do testing better. So they created a solution. And now they are looking like okay
what kind of problem can be solved with it. Just go the other way around. Just start with what
problems do you see in the world?
00:14:49:13 - 00:15:03:08
Jens
And if you want to use AI to solve it, fine. If you want to use Kubernetes also okay. Just code
also fine. If you don't write code at all, it's also good. So yeah. Try again.
00:15:03:10 - 00:15:16:23
Stefan
I love this, by the way, from David. So next week, Jacob writes this down for the next, session,
but we should do a founder tier list. We'll, we'll put together, like, I'll send a list of founders I like.
You'll send a list of founders you like, and we'll do a tier list and rank them and we'll put
ourselves into there as well.
00:15:16:23 - 00:15:21:13
Stefan
But if we compare oh, I.
00:15:21:15 - 00:15:28:27
Jens
I know 100% for sure. I'm the best CEO at WunderGraph.
00:15:28:29 - 00:15:33:23
Stefan
There it is. The Jens joke. All right. Ggo to slide six.
00:15:33:23 - 00:15:39:08
Jens
Let's see this next one. Marblism.
00:15:39:10 - 00:16:08:12
Stefan
Wait. Is this a YC company? Okay. So their their latest batch is kind of cracked. They have a lot
of AI stuff, so productivity automation dev tools. The tagline is AI employees who love overtime.
That's kind of scary HQ San Francisco. So they already have a leg up. Let's see. Yeah. Let's
see the website.
