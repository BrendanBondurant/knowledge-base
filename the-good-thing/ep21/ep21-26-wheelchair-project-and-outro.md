Jens
Yeah. Speaking of yachts, just the other day I was, you know, you know, you know how I have,
when I was 18, I had a really bad accident. I almost lost one. One of my legs. Since then, I'm,
I'm. I have a disability, and, like, I can walk, but not hike, or stuff.
01:17:28:29 - 01:17:59:23
Jens
And, this got me into into circles with people with uh, disabilities, people in wheelchairs and
stuff. And just the other day, I was contacted by someone they do a project in Tanzania, where
they help kids, build a wheelchair because, in Tanzania, like many kids, if they, you know, they
get born and they , I'm not sure what is the right term, but they have like an, their, their back is
open, so they need, like an operation.
01:17:59:27 - 01:18:24:09
Jens
Otherwise they would actually die. And after they get this operation, which there's a German, a
German doctor, she, she flies there on, on her own money, operates tickets to help them. But
the problem is they don't have a wheelchair, they don't have a wheelchair. And so I was
contacted by by someone in the in this, wheelchair,
01:18:24:11 - 01:18:25:11
Stefan
Wheelchair.
01:18:25:14 - 01:18:54:29
Jens
Circuit, whatever. And they ask me, hey, can you can you, maybe donate something, and help
us, building up like, like a, they want to help the people in, in Indonesia, in Tanzania that they
actually build the wheelchairs themselves because, like, buying them from Germany or
something, like in Germany, for example. A wheelchair costs around 4 to 5 K if you build it in
Tanzania, it costs around 250 bucks.
01:18:55:01 - 01:19:00:11
Jens
And so they try to get some material there and build it up. So yeah. Speaking of.
01:19:00:11 - 01:19:01:15
Stefan
Yachts.
01:19:01:17 - 01:19:26:07
Jens
I just, put a little bit of money into into actually helping them. And if someone else, wants to join
and help, kids who almost died in Tanzania to, to get a wheelchair, then, you can you can DM
me and then follow up. It's like, so good. Speaking of what founders do with their money.
01:19:26:09 - 01:19:32:22
Stefan
Spoken like a true politician. You went completely around the question, when is your yacht
done? Is what we want to know.
01:19:32:24 - 01:19:34:19
Jens
Nobody cares about yachts.
01:19:34:21 - 01:19:51:18
Stefan
Oh, awesome. I thought this was building. I thought about giving them money about a yacht
instead. Would have been a horrible end. But guys, thank you so much for joining us today. This
was a great episode of The Good Thing. Jacob is going to clip these. You'll see them on social
media one last time. Let's give a round of applause to all these startups.
01:19:51:20 - 01:20:03:08
Stefan
Building startups is hard. We hope that some pivot. We hope that some survive. We hope that
all survive. But that's the end of our episode. We'll see you. Oh, wait. Actually, what's the good
thing Jens?
01:20:03:08 - 01:20:07:01
Jens
We’ll See you next week.
01:20:07:04 - 01:20:15:16
Stefan
See you next week. Bye guys.
01:20:15:19 - 01:20:17:27
Stefan
I wonder if I'm supposed to turn it off or Jacob turns out.
