summary: Stefan and Jens continue their ThunderCode evaluation, criticizing the poor
  UI and questioning the target customer messaging that focuses on developers rather
  than decision makers. They note this is a very early-stage startup not part of Y
  Combinator, ultimately placing it in the "RIP" tier. However, Jens acknowledges
  that while the current execution is poor, smart founders could potentially pivot
  with the feedback provided.

Stefan
00:10:11:26 - 00:10:33:01
Jens
Okay. Who are those people back at developer QA. Lee, DevOps engineer. You need to be
super careful. Like, we we we need to see the, the messages from leaders, from management,
not from developers. We're not selling to developers. We're selling to decision makers.
00:10:33:03 - 00:10:33:18
Stefan
If you go up.
00:10:33:18 - 00:10:37:18
Jens
Overall, I think it's pretty tough. Where is the pricing? Stefan.
00:10:37:21 - 00:10:39:20
Stefan
There is no pricing. Click on the product page
00:10:39:20 - 00:10:49:27
Jens
use it.
Book a demo okay. With this book. A demo like it's AI it's so simple to set up. Why can I not just
00:10:49:29 - 00:10:53:05
Stefan
Click on the product.
00:10:53:07 - 00:10:54:01
Jens
What product?
00:10:54:02 - 00:10:57:03
Stefan
On a product I want to see.
00:10:57:05 - 00:10:59:02
Jens
You want to watch it?
00:10:59:03 - 00:11:11:06
Stefan
No, Let's do it like this is way early actually. Hold up. I would have sped that part up.
00:11:11:09 - 00:11:19:15
Stefan
Okay, this is definitely a very early stage startup okay. Features.
00:11:19:17 - 00:11:28:18
Stefan
Target market. What does that mean? Quality assurance practices.
00:11:28:21 - 00:11:34:00
Stefan
Now I'm going to be completely honest with you. This UI is horrible.
00:11:34:02 - 00:11:36:28
Jens
Are they part of a YC batch?
00:11:37:00 - 00:11:38:12
Stefan
They are not.
00:11:38:14 - 00:11:42:03
Jens
No. Okay. I would have never invested into this company.
00:11:42:05 - 00:11:45:22
Stefan
Okay, so let me flip to screen. Let's go to the tier list.
00:11:45:24 - 00:11:46:18
Jens
What is below F?
00:11:46:18 - 00:12:07:28
Stefan
Yeah okay. Hold up. All right. So what were they? They were thunder code. We're going to put
them in rest in peace. Yeah, yeah. Goodbye. Go back go back to the criteria list on slide three.
Yeah. Okay. Are they solving a real meaningful problem. They are not I really I don't know I don't
know.
00:12:07:28 - 00:12:09:28
Jens
I don’t know What they are solving.
00:12:10:00 - 00:12:31:04
Stefan
They're automating QA tests okay. But it is a meaningful problem. Is it real I don't know, are they
unique or are they being outplayed? I think that they're super early. I don't see any difference to
like using postman or just setting up like any of your other tooling. I don't know what do you
think Jens. any differentiation.
00:12:31:06 - 00:13:06:12
Jens
I mean, the first thing, you can only have impact if you are able to clearly articulate the problem
you're solving. So we didn't see that. So no differentiation are they unique I mean they are
uniquely bad. That's definitely something that that stands out. Gut feeling. Does it feel like it's
going to work out? I'm honest with you, with the feedback we have now provided, they could
actually they could actually pivot because, like, I don't want to offend the people behind it, but,
oftentimes I saw that startup founders are quite smart.
