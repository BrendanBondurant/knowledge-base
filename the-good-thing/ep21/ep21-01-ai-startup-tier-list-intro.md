Episode 21
00:00:18:28 - 00:00:19:13
Jens
And we're.
00:00:19:13 - 00:00:27:29
Stefan
Back. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of The Good Thing. I'm joined
by my co-host, as always, Jens. Jens how are you doing today?
00:00:28:01 - 00:00:35:06
Jens
I'm good. We we. You can't imagine. We just wasted, like, I don't know, ten minutes.
00:00:35:08 - 00:00:36:27
Stefan
To figure out the game.
We're going to play today.
00:00:39:00 - 00:01:00:15
Stefan
Yeah apologies guys. So we're going to be playing a game. And it took us ten minutes to to kind
of figure it out. We were explaining and then the end goes, well, why don't we just explain this
on the podcast? Yes. Okay. But, today we have a cool game. If you guys remember a couple
episodes ago, we did it like an improv, roasting, landing pages.
00:01:00:15 - 00:01:26:04
Stefan
So we roasted all landing pages, and we were trying to figure out, like, if it's a good landing
page because we were trying to take inspiration for ours. Today, we have a the good thing 2025.
I start up, tier list. So what we're going to be doing is our content producer organized about ten
AI startups that we haven't heard about, and we have a category ranking, which I'll actually
show you right now, real quick here is here the good thing I start up tier list and we have five
tiers.
00:01:26:08 - 00:01:43:24
Stefan
This is going to be unicorn. This is going to be the new open AI. It will survive most likely to B or
C. So it might IPO it might get acquired but it'll survive. There's a good chance that it could
survive. It probably get acquired somewhere in between the stages. This one is a total coin flip.
We have no idea what will happen with that one.
00:01:44:01 - 00:01:58:10
Stefan
And then we have a RIP. It's most likely going to die. We're going to go through ten, ten
startups. All of them are down there. So you'll see Thunder code. Now, I've never heard of
these, by the way. This is crazy. Like being so deep in the space. Like I have not heard of any of
these Jens.
00:01:58:13 - 00:02:00:10
Stefan
Have you heard of any of these?
00:02:00:12 - 00:02:06:10
Jens
No, but I guess the goal for today is we will destroy ten dreams, right?
00:02:06:12 - 00:02:17:05
Stefan
Well, it depends. One, we're going to find out if we would be good VCs because we're seeing it.
Yeah. We'll put our tier list and then we'll revisit it in five years. And then we'll see how well we
did.
00:02:17:07 - 00:02:20:03
Jens
What do you know about VCs?
00:02:20:05 - 00:02:37:27
Stefan
I know a lot, to be honest. I know that sometimes they don't know about anything. So it'll be
good to see how good we do when we're evaluating companies. And then from that point, what
we'll do is we'll put them into these categories and we'll actually see how well we did, and then
we'll discuss. So let's get started.
00:02:37:27 - 00:02:41:06
Stefan
Let's share your screens Jens.
00:02:41:06 - 00:02:41:28
Jens
And by the way.
00:02:42:05 - 00:02:43:04
Stefan
00:02:43:06 - 00:03:18:19
Jens
Audience we're also curious about your opinion. So if, Yeah, let let's get into it and, and see
what do you think about the startups. Okay. So this is a tier list. So our producer said everybody
on the internet does tier lists. And the interesting bit is I have never heard about tier lists, to be
honest, because I'm, I'm super busy doing, startup, but, Jacob or Stefan, can you explain to me
what is a tier list?
