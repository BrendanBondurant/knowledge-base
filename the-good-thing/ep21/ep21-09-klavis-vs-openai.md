mentions:
  - MCP integration platform
  - Cursor's 17,000 viewer update
  - developer tool bubble indicators
  - tiny TAM for MCP services
  - ChatGPT's one-click MCP connection
  - API integrations comparison
  - 40+ application connections
summary: Stefan and Jens evaluate Klavis, a Y Combinator company providing MCP integration
  services. They struggle with unclear messaging and note the tiny market size for
  MCP tools, comparing it to a bubble where Cursor's major update only reached 17,000
  people. Jens concludes the startup is "dead at the beginning" since ChatGPT already
  provides one-click MCP server connections, making Klavis redundant.

Good HQ it's in San Francisco is this this is also a YC backed company. All right let's check it
out. So far the tagline and I'm not sold on it just seems like a lot of tech.
00:27:20:06 - 00:27:30:19
Jens
Yeah. If I read MCP, I already think the the the term is just I don't know a handful of people, but
okay.
00:27:30:21 - 00:27:53:12
Stefan
You let's take a look. By the way, cursor yesterday announced like some big update and 17,000
people worldwide saw it. And somebody was like, Holy crap, we're in a bubble. Like everyone in
our industry is talking about cursor, cursor, cursor, cursor, cursor. But only 17,000 people saw
the their latest update. I think that kinda shows you like holy crap.
00:27:53:12 - 00:28:10:16
Stefan
Like it's huge. So yeah,Jenstagram. But that's why I'm just trying to get to point is I think we're in
a bubble. As soon as you see MCP your Tam is tiny. So let's go through this. To be honest, I
think you should go through this one. This one is pretty technical, so start us off Jens.
00:28:10:18 - 00:28:34:02
Jens
MCP, Model context protocol. MCP integrations for AI applications. Okay. I'm not sure what it is
the best way to get access to production ready MCP service at scale. What problem are you
solving?
00:28:34:05 - 00:28:40:18
Stefan
Wait, wait, so what do they do? They get. It's an easy way to get access to MCP servers?
00:28:40:21 - 00:29:07:27
Jens
I don't know. Okay, let's try it. So you make a Post request to this API, you create an MCP
server. This needs my API key okay. And then server name user ID platform name okay. It it it, I
don't know what it does. It's not this is not self explanatory. Integrate any tool or MCP server you
like.
00:29:07:29 - 00:29:37:28
Jens
So I somehow assume that I can use this. And they will give me an MCP server that talks to all
these things. I guess, maybe, let's click MCP servers. Okay, I think my assumption is right, but
why can they not say like. I, what is David saying?
00:29:38:01 - 00:29:49:10
Stefan
No, Diego. So ten years ago that would have read API integrations for cloud applications. It
yeah, it's the same amount of info. I don't get this. What does this mean?
00:29:49:13 - 00:30:10:14
Jens
Okay, so I think what you what you want to say. Like I can rewrite your hero. So your hero is so
let's say I don't know, let's say this are 4040 applications. Okay. And here what they what they
say here, connect chat GPT to more than 40.
