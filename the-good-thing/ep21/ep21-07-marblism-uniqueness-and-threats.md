Jens
Five I, I just give a little bit of feedback. Can you just put this here?
00:20:13:27 - 00:20:16:09
Stefan
Yeah.
00:20:16:11 - 00:20:30:20
Jens
What why why do I have to like if you, if you put, like, what is it called. Scroll. If you put scroll
depth on this website, how many people scroll until they get here versus see it here and then
yeah, maybe put it up.
00:20:30:22 - 00:20:36:14
Stefan
I would add post hog too to the website and see where people scroll down to.
00:20:36:17 - 00:20:40:26
Jens
Average cost savings. Okay.
00:20:40:28 - 00:20:44:20
Stefan
Okay. Money back guaranteed.
00:20:44:22 - 00:20:50:03
Jens
And then let's see the pricing pricing pricing.
00:20:50:05 - 00:20:51:16
Stefan
00:20:51:18 - 00:20:55:25
Jens
They have different pricings.
00:20:55:27 - 00:21:02:03
Stefan
Oh it says it right there. It's right there, the bottom left. So you see per higher year wow I.
00:21:02:03 - 00:21:07:00
Jens
Did that's invisible. Are they crazy.
00:21:07:02 - 00:21:15:17
Stefan
I think is, is that for all of them you get 25, $29 a month or is it per employee?
00:21:15:19 - 00:21:24:04
Jens
What do I pay? 29. And it could cost 119. I'm confused.
00:21:24:07 - 00:21:25:25
Stefan
And I don't know.
00:21:25:26 - 00:21:36:04
Jens
What will it really cost? And why can I click on multiple. Like what? Okay, this is what they do.
What is the pricing.
00:21:36:06 - 00:21:42:29
Stefan
What if you click on the pricing or get started for free? If you click on Get Started for free.
00:21:43:01 - 00:21:46:00
Jens
Yeah this, signs me up again.
00:21:46:02 - 00:22:06:26
Stefan
Oops. Do you have the link to navigator? By the way? Nope. I was going to say I want to look
up the founders. I don't know if this is an experience. It's on there. Go back to the slide? The
LinkedIn's on there Okay, go back.
00:22:06:28 - 00:22:18:02
Stefan
Okay. So this is a very early stage. Click insights okay. click on people.
00:22:18:04 - 00:22:25:23
Stefan
Oh okay. Awesome. Oh I don't know. But I think he looks pretty young.
00:22:25:25 - 00:22:28:00
Jens
That doesn't mean much.
00:22:28:03 - 00:22:28:21
Stefan
This is all.
00:22:28:21 - 00:22:44:24
Jens
Okay. But yeah, I, I, I would change a little bit the pricing. I would put the price here and I would
make it clear that I pay for everybody or one. Lets rank it. Okay. Should we go through the
checklist?
00:22:44:26 - 00:22:49:06
Stefan
Yeah. Head back to the to the presentation.
00:22:49:08 - 00:23:08:13
Jens
And by the way, this sounds like it might cost 119 or maybe 29. I'm really not clear on what are
we getting. Yeah. Anyways, let's go back to our criteria, Stefan. Impact. Are they solving a real
meaningful problem?
00:23:08:16 - 00:23:23:13
Stefan
I think they are. This would be great for agencies or small to medium sized businesses that don't
have the resources to hire a paralegal to an executive assistant to social media manager. I think
they are solving a real, meaningful problem. What about you?
