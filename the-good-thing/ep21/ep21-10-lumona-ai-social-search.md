summary: Stefan and Jens place Klavis in the "RIP" tier due to ChatGPT competition.
  They transition to Lumona, an AI-enabled search engine focusing on social media
  insights from San Francisco. While acknowledging search as a big industry, they
  immediately question the differentiation since existing search engines already use
  AI. Jens also critiques producer Jacob's inconsistent slide formatting.

Apps.
00:30:11:11 - 00:30:37:06
Jens
In one click. That's what you're doing. Your problem is that. And we can actually cut it short here
because this is sorry but this is it's it's dead at the beginning. ChatGPT allows me to connect
MCP servers with one click. It it already exists. So this startup is already dead. So we can we
can just wait.
00:30:37:06 - 00:30:43:16
Stefan
I want to see the premise of this. Yeah.
00:30:43:18 - 00:30:44:19
Jens
I don't know.
00:30:44:19 - 00:30:57:08
Stefan
One Hundred API calls a month. Okay. Unlimited access. MCP clients. Is there any social proof?
I love the enterprise CEO and CTO support. That's what we used to do.
00:30:57:10 - 00:31:00:27
Jens
What? Yeah, okay. Two people A 2 A 2 person startup
00:31:00:29 - 00:31:03:02
Stefan
00:31:03:04 - 00:31:10:27
Jens
I'm sorry, I'm an ass. Okay. This this is not going to work. Zero chance.
00:31:10:29 - 00:31:17:12
Stefan
the curriculum.
So I think I would agree. Okay. And then I go to the tier list. Now let's actually go to real quick,
00:31:17:12 - 00:31:22:08
Jens
Are they solving a real problem. No they don't because OpenAI.
00:31:22:10 - 00:31:23:07
Stefan
00:31:23:10 - 00:31:34:27
Jens
Doesn't have this problem. So it's also not differentiated gut feeling guys do something else. You
have you have YC backing. Just pivot.
00:31:34:29 - 00:31:38:22
Stefan
Okay. It was Klavis. Rest in peace.
00:31:38:24 - 00:31:42:28
Jens
It was Klavis. Yes.
00:31:43:00 - 00:32:03:03
Stefan
Okay. Sorry, guys. Oh. What happened on the slide? There we go. Okay, here we go. Lumona
AI enabled search engine featuring insights from social media. Okay. Search. Search is a very
big industry. A very big problem, San Francisco. Let's go. I think that there was.
00:32:03:06 - 00:32:13:29
Jens
This one line.
Take a moment at and look at how Jacob formats slides. You see here everything is one line.
00:32:14:02 - 00:32:22:09
Stefan
Like bro, you had one job.
00:32:22:12 - 00:32:29:01
Stefan
It's so funny here. I knew you were going to say that. Yeah. All right, let's see the website.
Lumona does an AI and image.
00:32:29:01 - 00:32:32:18
Jens
Search engine featuring insights from social media.
00:32:32:25 - 00:32:38:29
Stefan
By the way, David has a good point. Arent search engines already using AI. Well, let's see what
problem they solved. But yeah you're right.
00:32:39:01 - 00:32:48:21
Jens
But step on. It's AI enabled. It's, it's a whole new game. Okay, I cannot scroll. I can just search.
00:32:48:23 - 00:32:53:22
Stefan
Search? What does lumona do?
00:32:53:24 - 00:33:02:08
Jens
It lets me search.
00:33:02:11 - 00:33:09:01
Stefan
This is dead in the water. This is chatgpt?
00:33:09:03 - 00:33:10:27
Jens
Yeah. It's chatgpt
00:33:11:00 - 00:33:14:22
Stefan
This is chatGPT or perplexity.
