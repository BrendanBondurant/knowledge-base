summary: |
  Jens expresses skepticism about AI adoption in VC, emphasizing that the venture capital process is inherently slow, personal, and relationship-driven, making it unsuitable for AI automation. They debate whether Amy solves a real problem, with uncertainty about associate performance issues in the VC industry. Stefan acknowledges potential benefits but they ultimately place Amy in the "coin flip" tier due to questions about market acceptance and problem-solution fit.

Stefan
I like the name too they like humanized her.
00:54:12:00 - 00:54:32:27
Jens
No, I don't like it. I. From. All interactions I had with VCs. Is that the VC process is this slow? It's
personal. It's due diligence. It's not. Some like you don't do it with with AI.
00:54:33:00 - 00:54:34:22
Stefan
AI.
00:54:34:24 - 00:54:40:19
Jens
Anyways. Impact. Are they solving a real meaningful problem?
00:54:40:22 - 00:54:45:09
Stefan
Are AI are associates doing a bad job?
00:54:45:11 - 00:55:04:24
Jens
So, um I don't know what. Maybe that solves a problem for VCs. I'm not a VC, I cannot speak
for it. Maybe it could look like they. They have a point, but maybe they don't. I I'm not sure. Do
you think it's a real problem?
00:55:04:26 - 00:55:13:15
Stefan
space.
I don't know, okay. Like associates, like, I feel like. I don't know, I don't know, I'm not in the VC
00:55:13:15 - 00:55:16:24
Jens
Okay. Differentiation.
00:55:16:26 - 00:55:39:11
Stefan
I haven't seen a company like this. I think they differentiated on having the worst landing page
possible so that that was very unique. Right? I don't know I don't know about this one, to be
honest. I'm. I'm on the fence, like, do you feel like it's going to work out. It could if if the problem
is legit, could API nuke it or open API?
00:55:39:13 - 00:55:42:04
Jens
Open AI will not nuke it.
00:55:42:06 - 00:55:51:21
Stefan
Yeah okay, let's get rid of the tier list. So it was Amy. I'd put them in coin flip I don't know.
00:55:51:23 - 00:55:54:10
Jens
Yeah, coinflip is fine.
00:55:54:12 - 00:56:04:19
Stefan
I have no idea what happened with them. All right. I think we have three more. Please give us a
good one. We haven't had one unicorn yet.
00:56:04:22 - 00:56:06:28
Jens
Okay, the last three.
00:56:07:00 - 00:56:16:28
Stefan

like South Carolina.

Jens
Dustin will love it.
00:56:19:01 - 00:56:35:13
Stefan
Pleasanton. Can somebody look up where Pleasanton is. Dustin so far might hate this. She
raised 21 million in seed funding. Holy shit 21.
00:56:35:13 - 00:56:36:26
