summary: |
  Stefan and Jens review ThunderCode's website, immediately noting the location disadvantage of being in Paris rather than San Francisco. They criticize the generic "AI testing agent" messaging and the overuse of "with the power of AI" language, comparing it to the .com boom. While they find some merit in the plain English test writing feature, they struggle to understand the clear value proposition and note the lack of transparent pricing.

00:06:06:21 - 00:06:11:04
Jens
But okay, let's see. Stefan, should we start?
00:06:11:06 - 00:06:13:22
Stefan
Let's start with number five.
00:06:13:24 - 00:06:23:14
Jens
What we start with number five. You mean like slide Five, five, five? Okay. ThunderCode, you
can read, I do slides, you can read.
00:06:23:16 - 00:06:42:27
Stefan
Okay. So the tagline is the AI testing agent for your software team. The industry of software, QA
and dev tools. I already know it's not going to make it because it's in Paris. No, I'm kidding.
Paris, France and Tunisia. Okay. And then here are the links. Let's start with the website first. So
far. Yeah, I kind of don't know what they do.
00:06:43:00 - 00:06:55:27
Jens
You have a point because I think it's a it's a huge disadvantage to not be in San Francisco. So
everybody who's not in San Francisco, you you immediately got a negative point.
00:06:55:29 - 00:07:06:16
Stefan
All right. It's the nature of the beast. Okay. Let's give this a sec we’ll both look at in and then
we'll go into it. Of course the cookie banner got to be in Europe.
00:07:06:17 - 00:07:13:24
Jens
Cookie banner is very important because this is a French company. It's in the EU.
00:07:13:26 - 00:07:15:14
Stefan
Very good job. There.
00:07:15:17 - 00:07:24:29
Jens
Okay, cool. The AI testing agent for your software teams. What Problem are they solving.
00:07:24:29 - 00:07:28:24
Stefan
Again, I don't know. It's the AI testing agent.
00:07:28:27 - 00:07:42:00
Jens
Oh. Nobody knows. Right. That's. No, that's no problem. It's just a thing. And. Yeah, so they
should have used AI to test their hero because it's meaningless.
00:07:42:02 - 00:07:49:26
Stefan
demo and then.
I also don't get the pricing look There's no pricing at the top. So I guess you have to book a
00:07:49:28 - 00:07:50:26
Stefan
Let's try and.
00:07:50:26 - 00:08:23:12
Jens
Transform manual testing into automated success. Create, manage and run automated tests
with the power of AI. No coding required. Thunder code helps QA teams deliver better software
faster. Okay, I give you like one very big tip. If you if you if your pitch. Is with the power of AI.
What you're telling me is we do something with computers and that is the most boring story
ever.
00:08:23:12 - 00:08:35:20
Jens
Like I cannot stand anymore to see with the power of AI. Sorry, it's. I really don't like it. That's. I
don't know how you think about it, Stefan.
00:08:35:22 - 00:08:55:27
Stefan
It's kind of the same way. It's like, yeah, hey, we do something with technology like they're just
throwing in the word AI in front of, like, I guess they're an AI company. You know what this feels
like to me? This is like the .com boom. Do you remember? Like, everybody was just
adding.com? Like there was pets.com, which was like exploding the website for whatever.
00:08:55:27 - 00:09:07:04
Stefan
And people just adding.com.com.com. Com we go up go up. That's actually huge right there. AI
powered test, AI agents, auto healing tests streamline. What problem.
00:09:07:10 - 00:09:17:12
Jens
Solving. What's the. All right I don't get it cross-platform test. So like yeah everybody does that
comprehensive test on analytics I don't.
00:09:17:12 - 00:09:28:15
Stefan
Know wait, wait. The first points are actually important. That should be there. Write test cases in
plain English and let our AI transform them into automated tests. That's not bad.
00:09:28:17 - 00:09:44:12
Jens
You know what the hero needs to be? The hero needs to be. Write tests in plain English. Save, I
don't know, ten hours. Whatever.
00:09:44:14 - 00:09:55:14
Jens
Powerful integrations. Nobody cares. Enterprise grade security. If you don't have that, then
okay, what do customer say?
00:09:55:16 - 00:09:57:18
Stefan
00:09:57:20 - 00:10:08:15
Jens
a tool ...
Integration with GitHub was smooth, automated test. Okay, that's not compelling. I finally found
