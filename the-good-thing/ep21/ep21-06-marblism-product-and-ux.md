Stefan
Oh, it's kind of cool.
00:16:09:12 - 00:16:11:12
Jens
Interesting design.
00:16:11:14 - 00:16:21:12
Stefan
I kind of like it. It's kind of like comic book. Andy Warhol oh, that's really creative.
00:16:21:14 - 00:16:48:23
Jens
So the first thing that catches me is the design, and I can click on these kind of things, and this
is cool. Instead of giving instead of just creating like ten agents and call it this, that they, they
gave them name like, hey, you can have Stan or whatever. All right, let's see. AI, employees that
work for your business grow your business with a team of AI employees who love overtime.
00:16:48:26 - 00:16:54:04
Stefan
It's okay. I kind of love there. Can you scroll down? Is there a scroll down or. No.
00:16:54:07 - 00:17:21:14
Jens
Yeah, but you know what I instantly like? Could be fake or not. If it's. If it's fake, shame on you.
But if it's true, 7820 businesses on boarded. It that's that's pretty dope. Just one thing. If you say
onboarded, that means they have created an account or something. Like what? What have they
achieved? Like, talk about the achievements.
00:17:21:20 - 00:17:26:25
Jens
What are the results you have delivered? Not just about. Yeah. Who signed up.
00:17:26:28 - 00:17:43:06
Stefan
Let me tell you though. Wait go up real quick. I loved, the people that they've put in. Like what
you saying? They gave them names. Linda, sunny, Eva, Kara. And you know what they're doing
here. They're humanizing it. Like, people are like, oh, I was going to take all our business, and
they kind of are playing away from that.
00:17:43:06 - 00:17:51:07
Stefan
It was like, no, you can work with Linda or Sunny or Eva. It's a very good psychological trick. But
so far I love the landing page. Okay.
00:17:51:09 - 00:17:56:10
Jens
AI employees, OK In total it's just six, but.
00:17:56:12 - 00:18:08:17
Stefan
All right now, is this something to set your day with? No social media? Not anymore. Thanks,
Brendan. Everything keeps getting pushed to next week. I don't know, ask Dustin about that
one. No, not our problem.
00:18:08:17 - 00:18:20:03
Jens
Problem. But I'm honest with you. This is great because they now filter the audience so if you
say, okay, this is my problem, then awesome.
00:18:20:05 - 00:18:32:14
Stefan
have to hire quite.
Meet your new team, stop struggling AI employees handle email social support so you don't
00:18:32:16 - 00:18:39:12
Stefan
You know what I really like? They're telling us. They're telling a story.
00:18:39:14 - 00:18:43:18
Jens
Okay, I can I can click on this.
00:18:48:18 - 00:19:04:09
Jens
Okay. It's an interactive session. Okay. I can talk to my social media manager in a in a chat. And
they do stuff for me.
00:19:04:11 - 00:19:15:20
Jens
I love the demo. Now talking to The executive assistant. Okay, well, would have been awesome
if I can click on something. But this is still very good.
00:19:15:22 - 00:19:35:21
Stefan
Okay, so they're doing what super human does, by the way. That's what superhuman does. And
it's super productive. I like this so far oh look at this. But did you see that? It says you stayed till
the end. Youre exactly what we're looking for. Use this discount code to get. So they're filtering
for like champions, people that will stay and help build with them.
00:19:35:21 - 00:19:37:02
Stefan
I love that.
00:19:37:05 - 00:19:48:14
Jens
Yeah. And then right from the demo I can I can sign up and everything. And to be honest this is
experienced founders. This this is pretty good knowledge.
00:19:48:17 - 00:19:49:24
Stefan
And I want to see if their experienced founders.
00:19:50:00 - 00:19:51:21
Jens
Good on them.
00:19:51:23 - 00:20:06:05
Stefan
This. Go down below to the next to the next one okay. Here we go. So marblism saves time. I
mean, here's the quantifiable stuff 92% satisfaction. Okay, 4.8 10,000 tasks completed by AI
employees every week.
