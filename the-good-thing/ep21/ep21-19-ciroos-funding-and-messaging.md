Stefan
Wow. February 2025 by 123 okay three founder team. They were working at AWS. Go to the
about us. I want to see who the founders are.
00:57:15:27 - 00:57:16:29
Jens
About us. Where is it.
00:57:16:29 - 00:57:21:09
Stefan
It? Yeah, it's in the navbar.
00:57:21:11 - 00:57:48:00
Stefan
Here. Yeah. Okay. scroll down. Our values are. Here we go. Yeah. Okay. So he built businesses
from 0 to 5 million for startup. He was a EXVP and GV at Cisco EXVP at Cisco EX VP of
products at Cisco AWS. Product runs marathon. Yeah, I mean, this is a stacked founder team.
Like they have a the experience doesn't mean that they'll do successful.
00:57:48:00 - 00:58:10:29
Stefan
But they obviously who are the angel investors. That'll tell us something to. Runs marathons for
fun. Nobody runs a marathon for fun. Why would Somebody do that and. Okay, so that's their
partner. Did they not have any angels in there.
00:58:11:02 - 00:58:15:28
Jens
They didn't show them. Let's try to figure out what they do okay.
00:58:16:00 - 00:58:30:16
Stefan
Become an SRE superhero. Reduce store investigate incident fast and drive autonomous
operations okay. So they're clearly building straight for the enterprises. By the way.
00:58:30:19 - 00:58:47:03
Jens
So one thing I, I understand, investigate incidents faster. Drive autonomous operations. I don't
know what this means and what the impact this can you can you translate to me reduce toil?
00:58:47:05 - 00:58:49:28
Stefan
I have no idea what toil is.
00:58:50:01 - 00:58:55:05
Jens
Okay, I thought I'm the. I'm the non-native speaker.
00:58:55:07 - 00:58:57:24
Stefan
Does anyone know what toil is? Yeah. David. What's toil?
00:58:57:25 - 00:59:02:06
Jens
Jacob? Jacob, what is toil?
00:59:02:08 - 00:59:27:10
Stefan
Oh, here is automate. Reduce SRE toil with out of the box enterprise. does it mean something
with integrations? tOil is working with stefan. probably to toil means to grind. I guess to work
hard. So reduce SRE hard work and grinding with out of the box enterprise integrations.
00:59:27:12 - 00:59:37:08
Jens
Okay. Feeling burnout from constant firefighting. You know what this reminds me of? If I go to
these guys so they all came from.
00:59:37:10 - 00:59:37:22
Stefan
Cisco.
00:59:37:28 - 00:59:42:12
Jens
Cisco Appdynamics must have been a really bad place to work.
00:59:42:12 - 00:59:45:23
Stefan
That's.
00:59:45:26 - 00:59:59:20
Jens
Imagine you work at a company, and you're so upset with SRE and whatever, and and the
maintenance of the of the platform that you create the startup that's hilarious.
00:59:59:22 - 01:00:12:08
Jens
Okay. Problem. It's pretty fast to actually check it. Okay. Yeah. I'm not an SRE. We need to ask,
Dustin our CTO if that's a real problem.
