summary: Stefan and Jens evaluate Nao, identifying it as a VS Code fork with data-specific
  features. They question its differentiation from Cursor, noting that Cursor already
  supports notebooks and similar functionality. Jens points out Nao's DBT/analytics
  integration and data indexing features, but both remain confused about unique value
  proposition, with Stefan directly asking "why can't you just use cursor?" and expressing
  doubt about Cursor's inability to handle data workflows.

Jens
No it's. Yeah okay. That's a fork of vs code. But here's the thing. Hello data vibing AI code editor.
Then they show a code editor and here it okay. It has autocompletion.
00:45:29:27 - 00:45:30:25
Stefan
Okay.
00:45:30:27 - 00:45:39:01
Jens
And here is a chat. But why? Why is it so freakin tiny? Like I have to zoom in. Okay.
00:45:39:03 - 00:45:44:02
Stefan
Is this a YC company? I think it is. Yeah, it is so Its a YC company.
00:45:44:04 - 00:45:45:01
Jens
Okay.
00:45:45:03 - 00:45:45:18
Stefan
I don't know.
00:45:45:18 - 00:45:48:21
Jens
What they do. So far. It looks like, vs code.
00:45:48:22 - 00:45:51:24
Stefan
Then they have post hog in there though.
00:45:51:27 - 00:45:59:12
Jens
ship data faster. See now now they here they have an editor.
00:45:59:14 - 00:46:03:06
Stefan
I'm confused though. This is cursor.
00:46:03:09 - 00:46:07:22
Jens
No, no, it's nao.
00:46:07:24 - 00:46:12:09
Stefan
But it's cursor. Like, why can't you just use cursor to do what they're doing?
00:46:12:11 - 00:46:31:21
Jens
Yeah. And this is one thing I wanted to bring up so I can run with DBT and analytics and Python
pipelines. Okay. There's one important thing because cursor has support for a thing. It's called
notebooks. And I think it does more or less the same thing.
00:46:31:24 - 00:46:34:11
Stefan
I'm so confused by this, to be honest.
00:46:34:14 - 00:46:54:04
Jens
S says looks like it could be a VSCode plugin. Yeah, I agree, native data integration tab to data.
Okay, they they index your tables and then they help you with Autocompletion. That's okay.
Instant diff preview.
00:46:54:07 - 00:46:56:06
Stefan
SHIP data faster.
00:46:56:09 - 00:47:01:15
Jens
Agent for data quality checks.
00:47:01:17 - 00:47:03:05
Stefan
To run all this more.
00:47:03:05 - 00:47:12:19
Jens
I'm Not sure data diff. If you say agent for data diff what you mean is I guess.
00:47:12:21 - 00:47:14:01
Stefan
00:47:14:03 - 00:47:39:27
Jens
What you what you mean is you have a system problem that makes two calls and compares the
data and then prints it like this. So what agent to run your tests. Okay. I think they fell in love too
much with the agent thing. This is weird. Like, this is is my computer is broken. Maybe. Okay.
Data warehouse.
00:47:39:27 - 00:47:48:24
Jens
Whatever start data vibing, How is it different than cursor?
00:47:48:25 - 00:47:56:15
Stefan
There we go.
00:47:56:18 - 00:47:58:27
Stefan
cursor can do this.
00:47:58:29 - 00:48:05:11
Jens
I don't believe the cursor cannot do it.
