summary: Stefan and Jens discover concerning GitHub activity patterns for Mlop, questioning
  their open source commitment and development progress. Despite the significant $21M
  funding round suggesting investor confidence, they debate the early warning signs
  of minimal public development activity and unclear open source strategy, ultimately
  struggling between "coin flip" and "RIP" tier placement.

Stefan
Okay, you know what? I like the open source platform, but I'm biased.
01:06:21:01 - 01:06:53:23
Jens
I don't like it. Because if you say open source, that means you need to build two businesses.
You need to build an open, a successful open source thing. And then after that you have to build
a successful business, which we have done. It took a couple of years. It's extremely hard. We
almost died. So just by doing it that way, I would say, yeah, it's it's already almost dead just
because it's hard.
01:06:53:25 - 01:06:55:19
Jens
Okay.
01:06:55:22 - 01:06:57:18
Stefan
So,
01:06:57:20 - 01:07:08:26
Jens
This is something that probably people who understand models, they would understand it better.
It seems to be sophisticated.
01:07:08:29 - 01:07:19:21
Jens
Okay. They are they are definitely leveraging tailwind here for the better. This looks cool.
01:07:19:24 - 01:07:22:08
Jens
Open source. Powerful. Fast.
01:07:22:10 - 01:07:24:23
Stefan
What do you pay for though if It's open source.
01:07:24:26 - 01:07:57:23
Jens
Yeah, that's my point. So what are they selling? They sell. Let's talk , with storage. Okay. Yeah, I
think, so here's my take. Landing page is cool. I guess if you build models, which I'm not sure if
so many people these days built models, I think more like like open AI builds models. I think it's
cool.
01:07:57:26 - 01:08:19:12
Jens
The biggest problem I see is it's absolutely unclear how they will do, on the, on the go to market
side, if we go to GitHub, they have 306 stars. So if it's not hundreds of thousands then I'm not
sure 0.01 they shipped.
01:08:19:13 - 01:08:20:04
Stefan
Two weeks.
01:08:20:06 - 01:08:21:16
Jens
Very early.
01:08:21:19 - 01:08:24:22
Stefan
Yeah. But two weeks ago was the last time they shipped.
01:08:24:25 - 01:08:32:23
Jens
Okay. That's that's crazy. Like, take a look at this GitHub calendar graph.
01:08:32:25 - 01:08:38:08
Stefan
Cosmo 32 weeks 19 we shipped 19 minutes ago.
01:08:38:08 - 01:08:46:19
Jens
Okay, thats an active startup.
01:08:46:21 - 01:08:49:08
Stefan
Why did they ship two weeks ago?
01:08:49:10 - 01:08:56:15
Jens
Good question. Maybe they are busy with some other stuff. But yeah, let's go to our board.
01:08:56:15 - 01:09:00:23
Stefan
real Quick though. We have a question from somebody. How many open PR is on GitHub?
01:09:00:26 - 01:09:05:16
Jens
Okay. Open PR one sick. Let me go back.
01:09:05:19 - 01:09:08:09
Stefan
Okay.
