summary: |
  Stefan and Jens discuss AI wrapper viability, concluding that simple wrappers like ThunderCode, Marblism, and Klavis have "absolutely no chance" of success. They transition to Nao, a "Cursor for data teams" from San Francisco, immediately critiquing the "ship data at business pace" messaging as problematic since enterprises are notoriously slow, joking about SAP-pace development taking years without delivery.

Stefan
Yeah I put it will survive I think they will survive.
00:42:11:02 - 00:42:12:12
Jens
They will survive.
00:42:12:14 - 00:42:19:04
Stefan
No I'm going to put a good chance. What do you think? There's a good chance they will survive.
00:42:19:06 - 00:42:34:09
Jens
If they have so much traction, they could pivot into more than just playbooks and stuff that they
could do much more in the in the sales. And AI thing so, yeah. Somewhere between A and B.
00:42:34:11 - 00:42:36:11
Stefan
Let's put it here, good chance for now.
00:42:36:13 - 00:42:36:22
Jens
Okay.
00:42:36:26 - 00:42:40:20
Stefan
But they're pretty decent. Well done guys.
00:42:40:22 - 00:42:43:21
Jens
We we had a question on the chat.
00:42:43:24 - 00:42:56:14
Stefan
Yeah. Do you guys think that the AI startup, which are actually just a < random API, ai API here
>, wrapper actually will survive the next two years? You want to answer that one?
00:42:56:16 - 00:43:14:17
Jens
I mean, if we look at the first couple startups, Thunder code, marblism and klavis and what we
said, I think it's pretty clear that, there's absolutely no chance these wrappers will get anywhere.
00:43:14:20 - 00:43:26:09
Stefan
Yeah. Agreed. Okay. Let's try slide ten. Oh, now here we go. Cursor for data teams dev tools
San Francisco get now.
00:43:26:09 - 00:43:38:28
Jens
if it is what I think it is I think it's really cool. But I also see a danger. Let's see.
00:43:39:00 - 00:43:47:09
Jens
Hello, data. Vibing. AI code editor to ship data at business pace.
00:43:47:12 - 00:44:00:01
Stefan
Wait, but that's horrible, because some businesses are super slow. Like, do you want to ship the
pace of your business? Like anyone that knows enterprises like it takes us six months to ship
one feature. You don't want that man.
00:44:00:03 - 00:44:05:18
Jens
Imagine what? Wait, I fix it. One Sec.
00:44:05:21 - 00:44:15:02
Stefan
Oh, God.
00:44:15:04 - 00:44:30:21
Stefan
Oh my God, oh my God. AI editor to ship data at SAP pace, you know, what that means is
they're going to put a deadline, they're going to get to the deadline, they're going to move the
deadline, and then before you know it, two years later, they havent ever built anything. Yeah.
00:44:30:23 - 00:44:34:09
Jens
Okay. So then.
00:44:34:12 - 00:44:34:24
Stefan
Hey.
00:44:34:26 - 00:44:48:29
Jens
AI code editor to ship data at business space. Yeah, I'm not sure. Let's see what this is. So this
zooms in here. I have this thing. Okay. not sre why its there.
00:44:49:01 - 00:44:58:17
Stefan
David brought up a good point. You remember last week we were talking to that bank guy, and
he was like, we ship six times a year.
00:44:58:19 - 00:45:10:23
Stefan
This could be good for data teams if they want to ship at that business pace. Oh my God. Yeah,
we ship twice a year. It's crazy. Jens I'm going to be completely honest to you, this looks like a
fork of vs code.
