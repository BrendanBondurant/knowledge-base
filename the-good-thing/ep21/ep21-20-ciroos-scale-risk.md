summary: |
  Stefan and Jens express confusion about Ciroos' value proposition in SRE incident management, questioning how it differs from existing tools like Incident.io. They suspect the founders raised a large seed round primarily based on their impressive Cisco/AWS resumes rather than clear product differentiation, ultimately placing them in the "coin flip" tier due to uncertainty about the actual problem being solved.

Stefan
Jacob, can you bring up David's last comment? Because it's what you said about Cisco
Appdynamics is to work hard, typically miserably. I guess they experience a lot toil at Cisco.
Technically, that's actually funny.
01:00:26:04 - 01:00:38:21
Jens
So. So I'm very honest with you. I absolutely don't understand what they do. Like something
with SRE, something investigates incidents faster, but I don't get it.
01:00:38:21 - 01:00:56:27
Stefan
It's how is this different from incident io like how is this is a specialized with SREs? You know
what, I'm going to be completely honest. I think that they've just been in the space for very long,
and they were able to raise a seed round, a massive seed round just based on their like,
experience and their resumes
01:00:56:28 - 01:00:58:06
Stefan
I don’t know what they solve.
01:00:58:06 - 01:00:59:09
Jens
Know, what it looks like to.
01:00:59:09 - 01:01:00:26
Stefan
Me.
01:01:00:28 - 01:01:30:19
Jens
Because so I saw the announcement and here if you if you skim it, you see this built on the
recently announced model context protocol MCP and agent to agent. So to me, what it looks
like is they have connectors to all these SRE tools Grafana, Prometheus, whatever. And they
build an agent that talks to all these things with APIs.
01:01:30:19 - 01:01:43:15
Jens
And then it does something. But yeah, I don't know. It sounds like something that, that Datadog
would do or Grafana would do or. Yeah, look.
01:01:43:15 - 01:01:54:07
Stefan
At this stuff from Diego 21 million at seed for founders with a good resume. Plus AI we are so
back. I think we're about to enter into a zerp era because I don't know what this does.
01:01:54:10 - 01:02:00:21
Jens
Stefan tell me for 21 million. What are they doing?
01:02:00:23 - 01:02:10:23
Stefan
They're making everybody a superhero in SRE. Okay, okay. Head back to the tier list.
01:02:10:25 - 01:02:18:04
Jens
Let's check here. Impact. Are they solving a real meaningful problem? So I.
01:02:18:04 - 01:02:22:01
Stefan
Think SRE is.
01:02:22:04 - 01:02:39:17
Jens
A real thing. It's a problem. It's. It's important to do it. And it's very meaningful. Are they solving
it? I am not sure what they do, but we have a bunch of statements from the chat. Maybe you
can bring it up. So what do we have?
01:02:39:19 - 01:02:56:16
Stefan
Me and Jacob keep clicking on it at the same time. Sorry, Jacob. Okay, I guess they leverage AI
to root cause incidents something that would take a typical on call engineer a few hours, why
don't they put this on the landing page? If that's what they do, I understand exactly what they
do. And I would pay money for this.
01:02:56:19 - 01:03:13:14
Jens
Yes, you know, the hero could be investigate incidents in minutes instead of hours by
connecting your 100 tools to AI, blah blah blah.
