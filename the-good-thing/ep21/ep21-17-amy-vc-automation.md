summary: Stefan explains Amy's functionality based on LinkedIn videos, describing
  how it automates VC associate tasks including due diligence, portfolio management,
  and market mapping. Jens questions the unclear landing page messaging, suggesting
  they should explicitly state "Amy does all the stuff that a sales associate does
  at a VC firm." They discuss the humanization strategy of giving the AI agent a personal
  name.

Stefan
Scroll down. I'm going to lie to you. I don't know what they're doing about the landing page, but
because I watched the videos, I kind of do understand what they do.
00:51:02:12 - 00:51:20:00
Stefan
Yeah, they have a good video on LinkedIn. Go on their LinkedIn. They're basically associates,
VC firms right here to see watch list monitoring, deep due diligence, exit planning, portfolio data,
market mapping, team evaluations, meeting preparation, all the stuff that an associate would do
at a VC firm.
00:51:20:03 - 00:51:27:25
Jens
But why don't they say Amy does all the stuff that a sales associate does at a VC firm.
00:51:27:27 - 00:51:30:23
Stefan
Ah they're a startup. They're figuring it out.
00:51:30:26 - 00:51:33:08
Jens
Okay, what is this? Draft an email
00:51:33:10 - 00:51:50:25
Stefan
You know what that means. But do you know that meme or it's like the guy, like aiming the gun
and then the person, like, right behind him aiming the gun. It's like, VC partners investing in this
to kill their own associates. And it's like, you know what I mean? It's like, wait, why are we
investing into Amy?
00:51:50:28 - 00:51:55:23
Stefan
to get rid of you, man. Of course.
00:51:55:25 - 00:51:58:18
Jens
Imagine you're an associate.
00:51:58:21 - 00:52:04:09
Stefan
And you're researching amy, and you find Amy, you're like, yeah, not going to bring this up.
00:52:04:09 - 00:52:10:27
Jens
So I think this this company is unfundable because every every associate will pass it.
00:52:11:00 - 00:52:14:28
Stefan
Nope. Not my shit. Okay. This one's actually good.
00:52:14:28 - 00:52:21:14
Jens
I didn't like it, so I'm not sure what is going on here.
00:52:21:17 - 00:52:26:20
Stefan
You know, if something is supposed to be happening here?
00:52:26:22 - 00:52:29:02
Stefan
Here's a competitive.
00:52:29:04 - 00:52:30:19
Jens
Churn rate list.
00:52:30:21 - 00:52:34:17
Stefan
Okay? I think their landing page is horrible. Go to their LinkedIn. No, I do want to see their I.
00:52:34:17 - 00:52:46:15
Jens
Think I honestly, I think this is one of the worst landing pages I've ever seen. So I don't
understand one tiny bit what this does.
00:52:46:17 - 00:52:56:23
Jens
Like, and I don't know why. Why is 97% of the screen black and then, you know, my my eyes
have to go here and then here and.
00:52:56:25 - 00:52:59:18
Stefan
00:52:59:21 - 00:53:01:20
Jens
Cool. Okay. Where should I go?
00:53:01:23 - 00:53:13:27
Stefan
LinkedIn. Go to their Linkedin because I know they have a cool I want to see it. So, go to posts.
00:53:13:29 - 00:53:23:26
Stefan
And close your messages to the Right. It's just a bunch of people spamming you. Scroll down.
00:53:23:29 - 00:53:31:21
Stefan
Okay, here's the video.
00:53:31:24 - 00:53:42:17
Stefan
Yeah, this is the video that I saw.
00:53:42:20 - 00:53:56:16
Stefan
I actually think I sent this to Jacob, though, but it's literally replacing associates.
00:53:56:19 - 00:54:05:24
Stefan
I think it's a good startup. I think they need to work on their landing page, though.
