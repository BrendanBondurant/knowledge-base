summary: 'Stefan explains the tier list grading system (S-tier to F-tier) while Jens
  admits to being unfamiliar with the concept, highlighting a generation gap. They
  establish four evaluation criteria: impact, differentiation, gut feeling, and Jens''
  addition of "will OpenAI kill it." They review the ten startups to be evaluated,
  with Jens immediately predicting text.ai will fail based on the name alone.'

Stefan
Okay, so a tier list is like a list S being like world class, the best, the unicorn, and then DF, rest in
peace. Shut down immediate. And so you just hear them within those rankings. So when we
evaluate the startup we're going to look at and we're going to be like okay wow this is a fantastic
tier list.
00:03:37:21 - 00:03:41:12
Stefan
Yeah David cut it out. So my my knowledge.
00:03:41:14 - 00:03:44:15
Jens
For tier list is F.
00:03:44:18 - 00:04:01:06
Stefan
Not very good. Not very good. So basically you just rank them A or S obviously the world class
and then A B C D just kind of like how you're grading you know like you have the grades. That's
what the tier list. So we're grading basically these startups on their potential to be a unicorn. It's
kind of funny though.
00:04:01:06 - 00:04:06:16
Stefan
It actually is a generation gap. Like my generation knows this. Your generation doesn't. I guess.
00:04:06:18 - 00:04:10:20
Jens
Yeah, it sounds like I'm getting a little bit old.
00:04:10:23 - 00:04:15:03
Stefan
It might be the case, but all right. here's the criteria.
00:04:15:06 - 00:04:28:00
Jens
Yeah. Criteria impact differentiation and gut feeling. Can I add one criteria because I think the
criteria number four should be, will OpenAI kill it.
00:04:28:02 - 00:04:32:20
Stefan
only.
It's a good one. Honestly I think you can edit that slide. Oh no. Just kidding Jacob made it view
00:04:32:20 - 00:04:37:20
Jens
But really what?
00:04:37:23 - 00:04:45:24
Stefan
Jacob is going to make it, so we can add to it. So yeah, let's add it. Will it get killed by OpenAI? I
actually kind of like that one.
00:04:45:27 - 00:05:01:19
Jens
Okay. Are they solving a real meaningful problem? Are they unique or are already being
outplayed? Does it feel like it's going to work out gut feeling okay. And then will OpenAI nuke it.
00:05:01:22 - 00:05:03:02
Stefan
Also I kind of like that better
00:05:03:04 - 00:05:14:06
Jens
producer.
So here's another view. And by the way, if I had to put the PowerPoint skills of Jacob, our
00:05:14:08 - 00:05:19:06
Stefan
On the tier list, what's the tier like? Dude, what are you.
00:05:19:06 - 00:05:27:21
Jens
Oh, okay. No, I see what you're doing. So this this. Why is it okay? That is Y Combinator
companies, right?
00:05:27:24 - 00:05:36:08
Stefan
Yeah. This generation gap or we're struggling here. I got it in the first second right there. So Y
equals funded by Y Combinator okay.
00:05:36:08 - 00:06:06:21
Jens
But I think you're you're formatting is off I I'm okay anyways. Founder code I have never heard
about it but sounds interesting. Marblism, Klavis, Lumona, Hyperbound, mao. That's probably
from China, Amy, Ciroos, and then M:lop and text.ai. I I think text.ai will definitely die like
absolutely no chance even even just from the name.
