summary: Stefan and Jens quickly evaluate text.ai's group chatbot platform, expressing
  immediate concerns about competition in the oversaturated AI agent market. Consistent
  with earlier predictions about the company's poor prospects, they dismiss it rapidly
  due to market oversaturation and place it in the "RIP" tier.

Stefan
Pop.
01:09:12:26 - 01:09:26:29
Jens
One issue and this pull request there never was a pull request. They they just started yesterday.
01:09:27:01 - 01:09:31:28
Stefan
I don't know, they really did.
01:09:32:01 - 01:09:34:12
Jens
Okay. I don't know. It's early.
01:09:34:12 - 01:09:38:16
Stefan
I think they're too. I think they're too early to judge.
01:09:38:19 - 01:09:39:01
Jens
Let's see.
01:09:39:04 - 01:09:45:25
Stefan
Are they solving a real problem?
01:09:45:28 - 01:09:58:09
Stefan
I agree with this statement. I just don't know what they're selling. I don't even know what the
problem that is that they're solving. I think they're too early to judge Jens
01:09:58:11 - 01:10:21:12
Jens
Yeah. Impact. Maybe it's a it's a real problem, I don't know. My question would also be if you go
the open source route, why like could you not do it as a closed source service and sell
something? I my personal opinion is as a startup you should always try and sell something and
not just build something. Differentiation.
01:10:21:14 - 01:10:33:01
Jens
I'm not the person to ask gut feeling I don't know this, I I'm not even like coinfli means 5050. I'm
I'm not on the on the 5050 side here.
01:10:33:03 - 01:10:54:28
Stefan
I'm going to put just all rip because I did two weeks is kind of crazy and they're in the spring
batch. So I guess maybe they just did demo day. You know what could have happened, by the
way? They could have done Demo Day and not gotten any funding. Yeah. Could be could be.
Okay. Last one, please be a unicorn.
01:10:54:28 - 01:11:09:05
Stefan
Please be a unicorn. Here we go. Text AI collaborative one SMS, WhatsApp telegram away
mobile messaging San Francisco YC backed, text.ai okay let's see I.
01:11:09:08 - 01:11:12:15
Jens
I don't have a good.
01:11:12:18 - 01:11:27:22
Stefan
Collaborative AI one. Discover local eats, plan group events, settle debates.
01:11:27:24 - 01:11:44:04
Stefan
Let's see. We have us a good statement from. Is this you? Actually I think this is what was your
use case. Most startups build around open source tooling and typically start building the open
source project at Big Tech. Jens. And see potential in offering it as a service. And a few execs
start a company around it, it's kind of your your path.
01:11:44:09 - 01:11:48:27
Stefan
a little bit.
01:11:48:29 - 01:12:27:10
Jens
Yeah. I, I agree with David, I would have also put a little bit space up here. Okay. But I think I
know what they do. So they give you collaborative AI on WhatsApp or something so I can have
a chat. I see. So text AI find us pretty hiking spots around Malibu. Okay, so you have a group,
and then you have an AI in this group.
