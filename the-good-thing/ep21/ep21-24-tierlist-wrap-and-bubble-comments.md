01:13:07:02 - 01:13:22:19
Stefan
FAQ, go to FAQ yeah, this might be B2C SaaS it looks like anybody can use it. It's free up to ten
messages every 12 hours. Jesus. I send that in like 30seconds.
01:13:22:22 - 01:13:25:05
Jens
Wheres the business model.
01:13:25:07 - 01:13:32:26
Stefan
I think it's free for now they’re going for growth. Then why would they limit the amount of texts.
01:13:32:29 - 01:13:36:12
Jens
To save costs?
01:13:36:14 - 01:13:42:20
Stefan
I don't get, I'm going to put no on this one.
01:13:42:25 - 01:13:54:13
Jens
You know what my biggest problem is? Like, why is the why is the hero so close to the top?
Like, it just feels off, like, here's space. Like use it.
01:13:54:15 - 01:14:12:27
Stefan
Scroll down. Let me see the demo. Okay, let's go hiking this weekend. Text ai find us some
pretty hikest. Here are some trees. Which one? You okay? Like, it's kind of a cool approach. I
think it's going to not get killed by open AI by Apple. Like what? What's stopping Apple? Yeah,
exactly. Apple intelligence already does this or will in a week.
01:14:12:27 - 01:14:16:10
Stefan

01:14:25:07 - 01:14:33:12
Stefan
Okay to tier list. I don't even think we need to go and do the criteria. Okay, this was a sad day.
01:14:33:14 - 01:14:48:06
Jens
Are they solving a real meaningful problem? Nope. Unique? Nope. Is it going to work out?
Nope. So we haven't found any unicorns.
That's so sad. Real quick though, I think it's important that we shared this part right here. Hold

Stefan
