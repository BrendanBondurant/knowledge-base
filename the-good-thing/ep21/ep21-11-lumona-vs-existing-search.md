summary: |
  Stefan and Jens analyze Lumona's differentiation as social media-focused search versus general web search. They note users can already add "Reddit" to queries for social insights and that ChatGPT increasingly handles search needs. With OpenAI's superior compute resources and market position, they conclude Lumona faces insurmountable competition and place it in the "RIP" tier, transitioning to Hyperbound for their next evaluation.

Jens
Yeah, but why? We already have it.
00:33:18:29 - 00:33:29:15
Stefan
I don't get this.
00:33:29:18 - 00:33:33:16
Jens
Hey. AI enabled search insights from social media.
00:33:33:16 - 00:33:38:29
Stefan
know.
Oh, okay. So it gets social media insights. Go back. Let me see the results. Right. Oh, you
00:33:39:00 - 00:33:53:00
Jens
You know what the difference is. Instead of searching the web they search social media. So that
I can see what people on social media think about most authentic Italian restaurants in New
York City.
00:33:53:03 - 00:34:00:03
Stefan
Well, let's see what social media said about their startup though. Ask it.
00:34:00:05 - 00:34:08:03
Jens
That's a cool idea. What does social media say?
00:34:08:03 - 00:34:16:03
Stefan
against Reddit.
Said their primary goal is to not make you put reddit in the query mode. You're competing
00:34:16:06 - 00:34:18:20
Jens
Lumona did I spell it right?
00:34:18:22 - 00:34:24:27
Stefan
Yeah.
00:34:24:29 - 00:34:30:17
Stefan
Okay.
00:34:30:19 - 00:34:46:29
Stefan
Like ready to print? Founded in 2023. Heres what lumona offers. Okay. It's, it's innovative
approach By leveraging insights from platforms.
00:34:47:02 - 00:34:55:14
Stefan
Okay. With proper attribution.
00:34:55:16 - 00:35:09:27
Stefan
This is a tough one. Okay. I'm going to put it into the I'm going to put it into the bin like it's a very,
very hard thing that they're solving. Let's see the criteria.
00:35:09:29 - 00:35:13:00
Jens
Are they solving a real meaningful problem?
00:35:13:02 - 00:35:23:24
Stefan
I don't think so. Like you could just add Reddit to the end of the query. Plus you can just type in
chat GPT. Now I've been using chat GPT for search way more.
00:35:23:26 - 00:35:28:20
Stefan
Plus I think OpenAI will completely nuke this.
00:35:28:22 - 00:35:36:01
Jens
Oh, OpenAI has more compute. They have more of anything. I, I don't see it happening.
00:35:36:03 - 00:35:42:09
Stefan
Okay. Sorry, guys. Okay. See my.
00:35:42:10 - 00:35:44:03
Jens
Hyperbound.
00:35:44:05 - 00:36:02:03
Stefan
Okay. I like the name already, siimulated AI sales role play platform sales enablement. This is
also YC Badge company, San Francisco, of course. And hyper bound AI not to be confused with
hyper mode. Correct. This is hyper bound. Okay, I really.
