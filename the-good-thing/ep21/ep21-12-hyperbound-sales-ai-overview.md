summary: Stefan and Jens review Hyperbound, a Y Combinator AI sales roleplay platform
  from San Francisco. They appreciate the clear value proposition of replicating top
  sales rep behaviors and are impressed by strong social proof including testimonials
  from 7000+ companies and YouTube presence. The platform offers various call types
  including "European style" and integrates with enterprise tools like Salesforce
  and HubSpot, though pricing transparency could be improved.

I would make this bigger because from my experience, you absolutely want to figure out your
top reps. The behavior and replicate this across the whole sales team. That's great.

Discovery.
00:38:19:27 - 00:38:43:24
Jens
I, I'm not the sales expert. But could be useful, I guess. Let's see. Trusted by reps from over
7000 companies. I don't trust that. But maybe. It's a lot of whitespace, actually.
00:38:43:26 - 00:38:51:24
Stefan
Are these testimonials? That's actually quite good. They have a lot of testimonials.
00:38:51:27 - 00:38:59:22
Jens
Okay. And they say it on YouTube. Yeah. That's strong.
00:38:59:24 - 00:39:05:23
Stefan
The wall of love.
00:39:05:25 - 00:39:08:24

Jens

00:39:13:10 - 00:39:26:06
Jens
One sec. here we go. This increased. Okay. It's good.
00:39:26:09 - 00:39:30:29
Jens
The process built for enterprise.
00:39:31:01 - 00:39:41:17
Stefan
Software to integrate with Salesforce HubSpot. Correct. SSO to be honest, I think this is a great.
00:39:41:20 - 00:39:45:12
Jens
Pricing.
00:39:45:14 - 00:40:00:16
Jens
Free, mid-market. I think I would prefer if mid-market had a pricing and not just book a demo,
but okay, I guess the product is complex.
