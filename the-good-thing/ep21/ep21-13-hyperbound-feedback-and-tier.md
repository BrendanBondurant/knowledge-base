Stefan
00:40:01:21 - 00:40:02:06
Jens
So you have to.
00:40:02:10 - 00:40:06:03
Stefan
Explain it,
00:40:06:06 - 00:40:08:12
Jens
Book demo.
00:40:08:14 - 00:40:15:01
Stefan
I would move.
I think that they're doing the right things. Click on enterprise. I want to see their enterprise page.
00:40:15:03 - 00:40:17:22
Jens
SSO to enterprise.
00:40:17:24 - 00:40:21:12
Stefan
Oh, but that's external and single sign on.
00:40:21:15 - 00:40:22:19
Jens
Yeah. And here.
00:40:22:22 - 00:40:24:22
Stefan
Internal internal. So like for your org.
00:40:24:23 - 00:40:39:22
Jens
Just just make it make it enterprise. And one other thing I think mid-market should be able to
just sign up but okay. And self-service. But it's fine. Maybe you intentionally want to do this to
talk to people. What do you want to see? Enterprise.
00:40:39:25 - 00:40:45:01
Stefan
Well, actually, we got it. We got to hurry up a little bit. We have a bunch more to say. So let's
jump real quick to the criteria.
00:40:45:03 - 00:40:46:07
Jens
We started very late.
00:40:46:09 - 00:40:58:26
Stefan
We started ten minutes late, so we still got 30 minutes to go. Let me see the criteria okay.
00:40:58:28 - 00:41:11:03
Jens
Criteria. Are they solving a real meaningful problem? I say yeah
00:41:11:05 - 00:41:37:16
Jens
I agree differentiation are they unique. Are they already being outplayed? I don't know the
market in this segment so well, but from how it looks like to me it looks quite sophisticated and
like way beyond, like just a wrapper or something. So, I think they put a lot of thought into this,
so it could be, could be unique and green.
00:41:37:17 - 00:41:51:28
Stefan
What if you got. I'm the same. I think it's a lot of unique and love it to the product. They have a
lot of testimonials. I think that they are unique. I feel like it's going to work out, and I don't think
OpenAI will nuke it. I think it could build it if you want it to with all your stuff.
00:41:52:03 - 00:42:06:16
Jens
They will not nuke it. So switch to our tier board. So unicorn I don't know will survive can
survive. Good chance.
