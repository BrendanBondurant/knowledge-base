Episode 2
00:00:24:25 - 00:00:43:07
Stefan
And we're back. Hey, everybody. Thank you guys so much for joining us today on another
episode of The Good Thing. I'm joined, as always, by my amazing co-host Jens. And today
we're going to be talking about some cool things that happened over the past, two weeks.
Apologies for not doing the last two weeks. I caught the flu.
00:00:43:07 - 00:00:54:26
Stefan
And then we also had our annual retreat, and we were up in Alta, Norway. So it's been a bit
since we last chatted. Jens, but, how are you? How are things? I mean, I talk to you all the time,
but how are things going with you?
00:00:54:28 - 00:00:58:10
Jens
I'm good. What do you think of the shirt?
00:00:58:13 - 00:01:03:03
Stefan
wife buy it?
I think it's better than most of your shirts. But I do like the fact that it's so nice. Where did your
00:01:03:03 - 00:01:07:09
Jens
For you? I think so.
00:01:07:11 - 00:01:13:04
Stefan
We have a funny joke here that. Jens he's like, I don't buy clothes. They just appear in my closet
because my wife bought it for.
00:01:13:06 - 00:01:14:17
Jens
Yeah, but.
00:01:14:17 - 00:01:34:03
Stefan
Awesome, dude. Today I'm excited to chat. Jens. So we got some really exciting stuff. So I want
to talk a little bit about, the culture and, the retreats that we do. And hopefully we can, I guess,
encourage some amazing engineers to join us. But Jens, talk to us about the past week. What
was your experience with Alta Norway?
00:01:34:06 - 00:01:43:13
Stefan
What what did you like about it? Tell us, maybe the audience a little bit about what we did up
there and just kind of what makes working at Wonder Graph amazing.
00:01:43:15 - 00:01:55:02
Jens
It was so funny. So we had, we had three batches off lights, so everybody came in in three
batches. I was in the last, but was it 2 or 3? Two, three?
00:01:55:05 - 00:01:56:15
Stefan
I don't know, because I took four.
00:01:56:17 - 00:02:15:27
Jens
No, no it was, it was three. Three Suvij and Nithin. Then you guys and then and then, Bjorn and
I and, Yeah. Imagine. So you fly into an airport in the middle of nowhere. You're on the last flight.
It's in the middle of the night. It's like 10 p.m. or something. You get your luggage.
00:02:16:03 - 00:02:42:08
Jens
Imagine this airport. It's like this. There's one. What's it called? The. Where you pick up your
luggage, the belts, the baggage claim. Yeah. Baggage claim. There's one little thing, and the
room is like just this one thing. That's the airport. You. You take your luggage, you walk out, and
then there comes, like a bus, with, like, weird lights and some weirdos step out, and they they
have, like, ten boxes of pizza.
00:02:42:10 - 00:03:02:11
Jens
That's. Yeah, that's just the scene. And every everything is like, snowy and everything. And then
we drive this bus to our lodge and, eventually the bus gets stuck because there was too much
snow. So we all get out and we carry our luggage, and then, yeah, we go into the lodge. We we
set up the fire and everything.
00:03:02:13 - 00:03:41:06
Jens
Over the days we had like two events. One event was, snow sledging with dogs, which was
pretty awesome. I have never thought that dogs can be such amazing. Animals, like how much
they can. They can carry. Imagine. Like, I'm, I'm not the, the most light person, but. Yeah. And, I
was together in the group with Nithin, so I don't know, like, probably 152 to 200 kilos, the sledge
and then five dogs in front of us, and they can pull it off, like, pretty decent.
00:03:41:06 - 00:04:06:01
Jens
So dogs are very cool. Like the. It was like Alaskan huskies. Pretty dope. Animals. Then we had
a workshop day. That was pretty, pretty cool because everybody, interacted in, really productive
way in, in such a place. It was also awesome. And then, third day we had this, what do you call
it, like motor skis, scooters, whatever.
00:04:06:03 - 00:04:43:28
Jens
Snowmobiling. Yeah. Snowmobile. And it was very interesting to explore the like the, the the
tundra there like everything is icy and whatnot and yeah, great views. Overall, it's it's really cool
that you can build the company that enables this kind of stuff and, and, yeah. So yeah, we're,
we're pretty happy of, of being able to, to, to do that and that, that we have all the, the support
from, from customers and the others who allow us to, to not just build a product, but also meet
from time to time.
00:04:44:00 - 00:04:51:06
Jens
And, you know, we're, remote only company. So, yeah, we're we're happy.
00:04:51:09 - 00:05:09:12
Stefan
I would add to that. I mean, one of the coolest things about Wunder Graph is so we are remote.
First we set you up with some equipment wherever you work in the world, that's fine. So we
have very flexible PTO. But the most important thing is, is we have to meet in person at least
twice a year, the whole team, sometimes a little bit more often.
00:05:09:12 - 00:05:26:23
Stefan
When we get new hires, we fly them out to Germany. We get this really cool place. We work
together, we eat Frankfurt schnitzel with the green sauce, and we collaborate together. The
reason we do that is because, there's a thing called zoom fatigue. You know, like me and you
are on zoom, but there's no better collaboration than when we're in person.
00:05:26:23 - 00:05:46:10
Stefan
Or we do a customer call. And you're right, next to me. And one of the benefits of Wunder Graph
is we understand you have a family. We understand that you live where you live, live where you
live, work on good work, and then come hang out in Akta Norway, Majorca, Austria, Amsterdam.
We fly you out, all expenses paid for, and you hang out with the team.
00:05:46:10 - 00:06:00:25
Stefan
We do team building and what I've noticed and Jens, correct me on this, is every time we come
back from the retreats, the energy level is just off the roof for the next 2 or 3 months until we
meet again.
00:06:00:27 - 00:06:26:10
Jens
Yeah, I would agree. Also, I think every retreat it somehow helps us to, to sharpen what we think
is wundergraph, what we should focus on all these kind of things. So you can you can kind of
see the, the journey from the very beginning pivot. And then over the last two retreats, I think it
got really, really sharp.
00:06:26:12 - 00:06:36:10
Jens
And then now I see where we are. Yeah. What would you say? What are your highlights from
the, from the, recent retreat?
00:06:36:12 - 00:06:51:02
Stefan
So good question. So for the audience, I actually, the week before I had the flu and I was still
recovering from it, so I know why Jens asked this question, but, the medication caused me to
have some stomach problems, so I was there, but I was struggling a little bit with health. I'm all
good now, though.
00:06:51:02 - 00:07:13:08
Stefan
But the biggest highlights for me is, first of all, the transparency. As founders, we're really
transparent with everyone that's on board with the company. So Jens always does a state of
wonder graph presentation where we talk about the ARR, we talk about any new things that are
important in the company. We talk about the product direction and we talk about everything fully
transparent.
00:07:13:10 - 00:07:32:08
Stefan
Everybody knows what deals are in the pipeline. They know which potential customers we might
get, and they know everything that's happening. And I think that's super useful because Jens,
you give us a bird's eye view to everybody, whether you're an engineer, whether you're on the
marketing team, whether you're on customer support. And I think that's important because it
creates a sense of camaraderie.
00:07:32:08 - 00:07:50:25
Stefan
And also a sense of belonging to the company. Is that, hey, I'm not just an engineer, and my
code just isn't just for some random customers, it's for these customers. And I can actually
contribute for the company. And so I think that's one of the best highlights this year. One of the
best highlights that we did is, with our rapid growth, we acquired a lot of customers.
00:07:50:25 - 00:08:12:06
Stefan
And so we've had to, on the fly, build up customer support. And I'm quite proud of the team. and
how we've done it. But this year we did a, Customer Success award ceremony where we gave
out awards to Rising stars, to customer support, engineer of the year. And I think that was really
exciting because, the engineers got feedback on how they did on something that they've never
done before.
00:08:12:06 - 00:08:36:29
Stefan
They really picked it up on the fly. And I would say our customer support is top tier. And so that
was another highlight. And then the third highlight is just I mean, just sitting around the fire, you
know, bantering, playing Mario Kart and just chatting with the team is always a positive. But
doing it in Norway where you're surrounded by snow and a beautiful cabin and you get to go to
a nice dinner and really celebrate the last year's accomplishments, I would say those are my top
three highlights.
00:08:37:01 - 00:08:58:08
Jens
Do you remember we had in the very in the very end we had like, kind of like a collaborative
survey thing. Where, where, where we collected like, well, what what are our, our biggest
strengths? Do you remember the, the one thing that that everybody kind of mentioned?
00:08:58:10 - 00:09:02:19
Stefan
I do, But, I want you to say it.
00:09:02:21 - 00:09:28:06
Jens
So, I think one, one thing that stood out. What what, what most of our, employees said is they
really like working in the company. And I was thinking a bit about, like, why is that? Like, well,
what what did we do? So, so that we, we kind of achieved that. Like, we, we didn't really want to
achieve that.
00:09:28:06 - 00:09:52:12
Jens
It's it's more like a consequence of what we do and how we act. And I think it has a very close
relationship with one thing that we hear from many engineers is that before they join us, they
work on some sort of product. And typically the loop between some customer request and when
they release it and when they get feedback.
00:09:52:19 - 00:10:19:12
Jens
This loop, it can be it can be weeks. It can be months, sometimes, years often times actually
never. And there's so often that engineers working in environments where they have like a
disconnect between customer and, and engineering and maybe you can you can speak a little
bit about how how it looks like inside inside Wunder Graph.
00:10:19:15 - 00:10:38:06
Stefan
Yeah, it's a great topic. And I think it's something that really differentiates us, especially as we
continue to scale and get more customers. We want to stay as close as possible to the
customers because I think the relationships we build, are amazing. So the way we currently do it
is per week. We have a engineer that's on call, and this is our on call engineer.
00:10:38:09 - 00:10:57:21
Stefan
And the priority is, is that if there's any customer issues that are segmented by whatever totem
skill that we have, that they need to jump in and support that person, the goal is they first try to
start on it, and then after that, if they need to escalate it, they escalate it. And I think that's super
important. And when they're not on support, they're doing feature development.
00:10:57:21 - 00:11:14:09
Stefan
And what's really great about being a customer of Wonder Graph is that you'll never talk to a
non-technical person. And I want this to go on as we continue to scale and we continue to grow.
But if you work on, for example, the router and you have an issue with the router, you have
direct access to the router team.
00:11:14:12 - 00:11:30:18
Stefan
And what's great is when they push an update or push a change they are directly encouraged.
We encourage our engineers to work on their soft skills and to talk to our customers. And so
they'll tell, I don't know, one of our customers, SoundCloud. Hey guys, we pushed a update to
the router. This was what you guys reported last week.
00:11:30:23 - 00:11:52:26
Stefan
Here are the updated changes. Please test it out and let us know. And I think that feedback loop
of actually allowing our engineers to talk with the customer, it creates this. I don't know what the
word is, but you can tell that our engineers like working at Wunder Graph because they're
actually able to see their contributions and how it affects the companies, and they are able to
get that feedback away.
00:11:52:26 - 00:11:56:27
Stefan
And the shorter the feedback loop, the happier they are. What do you think on that Jens?
00:11:57:00 - 00:12:05:01
Jens
And by the way, don't touch your microphone. But should I do it like you're doing this all the
time?
00:12:05:03 - 00:12:07:06
Stefan
I think it was my jacket hitting it. Is it better now?
00:12:07:06 - 00:12:34:02
Jens
Yeah. No. It's fine. Yeah, I think it's really this, this close feedback loop. And it's also, it's very,
very rare that you're working on something that there's no customer waiting. So, so typically
there's always like immediate demand like the, the market is pulling and yeah we, we we can't
catch up. That's why we're hiring people. And it's really important what you're working on.
00:12:34:02 - 00:12:58:07
Jens
We try to slice it in small portions. Release fast. And and also another big topic, reliability
because you cannot be fast if you're not reliable. One of our biggest toppings is you can, for
example, take a look at our our test suite. It's it's growing so fast. And then just recently we, we
heavily invested into making our tests, much faster.
00:12:58:09 - 00:13:14:07
Jens
And we have an end to end test suite. And for example, one one thing we had like, testing a
cycle of two minutes to run a test, not so bad, but for us, it was too slow. We've now cut it down
to 10s to run our complete end to end test suite. And it's it's just ever growing.
00:13:14:07 - 00:13:49:01
Jens
Because for us, on the one hand side, we want to move like super fast. But with so many
customers, who who rely on the, the correctness of our solution, it's just it's paramount that we
that we really focus on, on releasing something that that absolutely works. And, yeah. So there's
a, there's a thin line between speed and, and, and reliability and, yeah, I think at this point in
time, we're, we're, we're walking, we're walking right in the middle of the street.
00:13:49:04 - 00:14:07:26
Stefan
I would agree. And a quick point there. Jens. So what do you see in the next couple of months.
What key hires are we looking for. So I understand on the marketing side we're looking for a
vice president of marketing of marketing. But on the engineering side, what are we looking for?
What roles and how can people apply and come join this amazing company?
00:14:07:28 - 00:14:34:00
Jens
Yeah, it's it's actually pretty simple. If you look at our code base, we have Cosmo, cosmos is full
stack, Node.js, TypeScript, in the front end we have, react in the backend, Node.js like Postgres
database, Redis, these standard boring things. And then on the, on the router side, our route is
written and go and our query planning engine and everything around that.
00:14:34:00 - 00:14:55:28
Jens
It's also written and go. So there's two very simple opportunities. You can come in as an
engineer focusing on go, or you can be a full stack engineer. Go. Engineer means you you build
your router, you work on things like like telemetry. You can work on the query planner. That's like
kind of like we have two disciplines.
00:14:56:01 - 00:15:22:01
Jens
We we somehow we're mentally split the router into two parts. One part is, more like a gateway.
And the second part is what we call the engine, which actually is the second repository. And in
the engine it's about query planning and execution. And that's kind of algorithmic, like data
structures, graph traversal, AST rewrites, all these kind of things.
00:15:22:03 - 00:15:48:21
Jens
I very much like it. It's it's interesting stuff. And then you have the, the gateway side telemetry
analytics metrics, like all things, gateway, what you would expect from, from an API gateway.
Yeah. And then in Cosmo, Cosmo is the brain of the whole thing. It understands, like, feature
flags and your graphs and composition and everything that that belongs there.
00:15:48:24 - 00:16:14:12
Jens
And, yeah, you have a, a mishmash of some functionality in the backend, then some React and
Tailwind and, in the front end. We want to show the functionality. We built, diagrams to expose,
the metrics and everything. So these are the main opportunities, I would say. And then inside
these two categories, you can also have like two focus points.
00:16:14:12 - 00:16:37:24
Jens
So you can have a focus point. Like you go very deep on the product and or you go a little bit
less on the product side and you go more customer facing because there's always like kind of
like we, we have, we have a long term vision where we want to drive the product and we have
like, like short term goals where we want to enable customers.
00:16:37:24 - 00:17:04:02
Jens
And you can be more in the, on the side of, of customer enablement, something like, oh, yeah,
we we need a custom middleware here. We need like custom customization for, for metrics or, I
don't know, the, multi-part protocol is not exactly implemented like some spec says, or whatever,
these kind of things. And then you have like, deep, long term efforts where we say, okay, this is
where we want to be in one year.
00:17:04:02 - 00:17:10:13
Jens
And this is, bit different, scope of tasks.
00:17:10:15 - 00:17:25:19
Stefan
Yeah. Well said. And if I was an engineer and I wanted to work at wundergraph. How would I
catch your eye? Because, we see every application that comes in. How would I catch your eye
Jens where you were like, we need to interview this person.
00:17:25:22 - 00:17:58:10
Jens
So, you know, there's there's this, this mythical 10X engineer, and we are not so big fans of the
10x engineer. We are big fans of someone who is good enough in terms of tech to do what
needs to be done, but they are an excellent team player and communicator. We're a remote
company. If you work together with people for a long time and you want to achieve a goal
together, you don't need so many sprinters.
00:17:58:13 - 00:18:25:04
Jens
You need, marathon runners who can actually work together as a team. Because if you run a
marathon as a team, someone needs to be in front, block the wind, and then everybody can
follow on like, a little bit, less paramount and then you need to, to circle around. And for us it's,
it's a team effort, but still you need to run fast enough.
00:18:25:04 - 00:18:51:16
Jens
So there is like a threshold. You need to be good enough. And and that's that's one part. But
don't be afraid of of, joining as a junior. We absolutely love juniors with the right attitude
because, we believe it's actually harder to hire seniors, seniors often they are they are
opinionated. They have habits. This can be good.
00:18:51:18 - 00:19:12:27
Jens
And it's also possible that they are incompatible with how we think versus juniors their opinion.
Often it is not yet so strong. So you can you can mold them a little bit more. So actually we like
both like for for seniors we need to see are they compatible with us. And it's okay. It's not like
everyone is different.
00:19:12:27 - 00:19:34:25
Jens
That's that's fine. And for for juniors we're also very open. So please, if you are a junior dev and
you're, you're ambitious and you're, you're super interested in learning and expanding. We hired
a bunch of juniors like, two years ago, and it's it's absolutely crazy what they have achieved in
two years. So, yeah.
00:19:34:27 - 00:19:52:06
Stefan
Yeah. Well said. And I think it's a good transition. So Jens mentioned, we're hiring. You can see
we've posted more jobs and they're going to keep posting. So keep a lookout on our jobs tab.
But I want to transition because we have a lot of topics to discuss today. Let's talk a little bit
about what happened on the retreat.
00:19:52:06 - 00:20:13:15
Stefan
So, Jens, aside, you're not able to mention the company name due to an NDA, but we are
working on a feature, pre warming cache. Can you kind of tell us like a high level overview of it
and why it's important? And then we can talk a little bit about the reason it's important. A little
hint it's for a very major event that's coming up in February.
00:20:13:15 - 00:20:23:00
Stefan
And we also want to talk a little bit about those preparations. But talk to me a little bit about the
pre warming cache. What exactly is it and why did we build it.
00:20:23:03 - 00:20:25:18
Jens
I can say the event right.
00:20:25:20 - 00:20:34:17
Stefan
Yeah you could say the event but you cannot under any circumstances mention the name of the
customer. Yeah please please we're live and don't do that.
00:20:34:19 - 00:20:56:20
Jens
So imagine you're a company and it uses federation. And you, you run an ad on the Super
Bowl. So you might get a little spike in the traffic, which means I don't know much about Super
Bowl. I guess it's it's kind of big. I don't know how big, but okay, so let's say I'm, I'm.
00:20:56:20 - 00:21:00:09
Stefan
Clipping that, by the way. And for our American audience, I love it.
00:21:00:11 - 00:21:25:10
Jens
So let's say you you you get a little a little spike in your traffic. That means you need to to scale
up your routers. Okay. Let's say you quickly scale up routers to satisfy the demand. What
happens if the querry hits a router and it takes 10s to plan the query.
00:21:25:13 - 00:21:29:18
Stefan
So non-technical question for the non-technical folks. Since this is on LinkedIn.
00:21:29:18 - 00:21:30:29
Jens
Like you.
00:21:31:01 - 00:21:41:02
Stefan
Basically yes. What is what do you mean by like a query. Like what what what's happening. Like
they hit this website and they they send a request in the query in the GraphQL query. Can you
explain that a little bit?
00:21:41:04 - 00:22:07:07
Jens
Okay. So you click on the ad, you go to a website. The website wants to show you some content
okay. This some content. It doesn't come from a single service. It comes from multiple
microservices. And these microservices in our federation land, we call them subgraphs. And we
have something that, it's called federate, Federation. We have something.
00:22:07:07 - 00:22:39:21
Jens
It's called composition. Composition is an algorithm that takes the descriptions of microservices,
meshes them together and creates what we call the super graph, which is a description that
describes how you could get data with the query language called GraphQL from all your
microservices. So instead of the website sending 100 requests to all these microservices, it's
sending a single request to something we call the router, which routes the query to the
subgraph.
00:22:39:24 - 00:23:04:26
Jens
So it sends this query to the router. The router then figures out how to load the data from all the
subgraphs, and then it it, makes a bunch of requests to the subgraphs fetches the data and
gives you the response. This is cool for the frontend engineers because they don't need to know
about 100 microservices. They just know about, the description of this, super graph.
00:23:04:28 - 00:23:35:26
Jens
The problem is, when you send this query the first time a simple query, it takes nanoseconds to
figure out how to get the data because we make one single fetch. But maybe you have like 100
microservice and your schema is a little bit more complex. There can be like abstract types and,
variations of complexity. And it can take a couple of seconds to figure out how to get you the
data for the query.
00:23:35:27 - 00:23:59:20
Jens
Now, a typical website doesn't have one single query. It can actually have 100, 500 a thousand
queries. So we have customers with up to 1000, queries in production or even more so that
means you you get a lot of traffic. You spin up new routers to handle the traffic because you
have autoscaling and all these cool things.
00:23:59:22 - 00:24:20:00
Jens
And now you have this router, and it doesn't know about this query. And it, it needs to plan this
query. So there's a mechanism to speed this up because you definitely don't want to create a
query plan for the same query twice. That would be very expensive. I mean it takes a couple
seconds. But as time.
00:24:20:03 - 00:24:44:26

So we have something we call it a query plan cache. So we get the query. We have a very
complicated process to create a hash for the query. And this hash it's our, our key in in in the
map map from this hash to query plan. Then we generate the query plan. It can take like worst
case we have one scenario where it takes 10s.
00:24:44:29 - 00:25:15:13
Jens
And yeah. Then we store this and the next time the request hits this router it comes from the
cache. So we we save 10s. Now there's a little problem. Let's say you get this spike in traffic,
and you start the router. That means the cache is empty. So in reality, you're scaling up your
infrastructure and then this new router, it gets hammered with requests and it takes more than
10s to plan this query.
00:25:15:16 - 00:25:41:09
Jens
This means the customer has to wait 10s. So they, they after clicking this ad, it costs you so
much money, it you might not like the product because it's so slow. Which means before we
actually take the router live, we should warm up the cache. So we should somehow have a
mechanism to fill the cache without the customer waiting for the request to come to the router.
00:25:41:09 - 00:26:09:12
Jens
So how can we do it? We built something for this. It's called cache warmer. And what we do is
every day we look into the, the analytics data of the last 30 days, and we calculate a top end list
of queries of how long it took them. It took the router to plan. So at the top of the list there will be
the query with the 10s.
00:26:09:12 - 00:26:35:08
Jens
And then there's a query with nine seconds. And then there's a whole bunch of queries with like
maybe 50 milliseconds or something. And then does queries in the nanoseconds. Okay. So you
create this list, we put it on a CDN. And now what we do is when the router starts up, we load
this list from the CDN, we precompute the query plans, we put them into the cache.
00:26:35:11 - 00:27:04:28
Jens
And then we take the router live, which means it takes a little bit longer until we we can get this
router live. But at the same time, the router is immediately capable of serving queries from the
query planning cache. So all we do is execute. So there is no additional latency. And you might
be thinking, okay, sounds very smart, cool solution, but why the heck does it take 10s to plan?
00:27:05:01 - 00:27:58:26
Jens
And, the the real reality is you can create like your, your, your subgraph or your super graph
composition in any possible level of complexity. And it's, it's a simple function of, of mathematics
that, if you have a very small query and a small schema, it takes nanoseconds. And as you as
you grow over time and you create like crazy complex queries, it can take a few seconds and, it
just, it just, I would say, there was the company who initially started to create, GraphQL
Federation, and they added a bunch of directives that do very cool things, like, provides
directives and external directives.
00:27:58:28 - 00:28:31:18
Jens
And there's also very cool concepts like interface objects. And I'm not even able to explain them
in detail. And all these directives together. Someone has invented them and at the time where
they invented them, the they thought it solves the problem. It solves a problem. Like, not not,
diminishing that, but as you scale your graph, you can run into situations where it's very, very
hard for your query planner to figure out how can I load this particular field?
00:28:31:20 - 00:28:53:09
Jens
Because it might be in one graph, it might be in another graph. But actually here's an abstract
type and it could be in 20 graphs. And so you have to compute every possible way this field
could be loaded. And the unfortunate reality is this computation. It's a CPU bound task. We we
cannot just like speed it up in some magical way.
00:28:53:09 - 00:29:21:09
Jens
We need to compute that. And then this. Yeah, this is a limitation of of federation. And the
solution to this problem is if you know ahead of time that you have, very complex query on your
landing page, then you should have something like, like a cache warmer. And we also have a
process, with persistent operations where, when you deploy your front end application, you can
actually register all operations.
00:29:21:09 - 00:29:35:13
Jens
So you can tell our backend, hey, I'm, I'm building an app and it has this query. It needs to be
warmed up. So you can you can tell us ahead of time and then, you will never have a, a
customer waiting for that query.
