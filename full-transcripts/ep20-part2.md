00:32:24:24 - 00:32:53:10
Stefan
He just has a big head. That's a thing. But first of all, can I just acknowledge how ridiculous this
is, that you can start a nonprofit, you can start a nonprofit, and then you can IPO, like anything
is possible in this world. So basically, I don't understand this. They've taken more than 13 billion
from Microsoft and it's converting its for profit into a public beneficiary corp, a structure designed
to rebalance shareholders return with social goals.
00:32:53:10 - 00:33:11:21
Stefan
Unlike nonprofits, which is focused solely on the public good. I'm going to be completely honest.
Sam Altman is not a dumb guy. I really think from the very beginning he did it as a nonprofit.
From the start, I don't think he would have gone as far as he could have gotten with regulation
and everything if he wasn't a nonprofit.
00:33:11:23 - 00:33:14:14
Stefan
What do you think on that?
00:33:14:16 - 00:33:16:29
Jens
Can you scroll all the way up?
00:33:17:02 - 00:33:19:25
Stefan
Yeah. one sec
00:33:19:27 - 00:33:43:13
Jens
Because I have to apologize, but I'm I'm just I'm just a very weird person how I read stuff. Okay,
let's read the headline. Open AI CFO says, okay, so what do you think? Do you think the
OpenAI CFO has shares in OpenAI?
00:33:43:15 - 00:33:45:04
Stefan
Yes, of course.
00:33:45:07 - 00:33:46:22
Jens
Lots of shares. Right?
00:33:46:24 - 00:33:52:14
Stefan
I mean, Chief Financial Officer Yeah, actually shes got a lot she didn't know. Motivated to IPO.
00:33:52:16 - 00:33:57:24
Jens
Okay, let's translate shareholder of shares.
00:33:57:27 - 00:33:59:16
Stefan
Says.
00:33:59:19 - 00:34:07:22
Jens
New structure of company opens door for potential IPO.
00:34:07:24 - 00:34:09:11
Jens
Who wouldn't say that.
00:34:09:13 - 00:34:11:06
Stefan
So now my shares.
00:34:11:06 - 00:34:14:28
Jens
Are worth more right. Ther's the potential for an IPO.
00:34:15:00 - 00:34:22:24
Stefan
Yeah. I mean she's also driving up. She's also driving up the value of her shares by just saying
that.
00:34:22:26 - 00:34:26:26
Jens
I yeah, that's what I mean. Dude.
00:34:26:29 - 00:34:51:21
Stefan
This is actually kind of funny. A PBC can get us an IPO if and when we want to. see what's
funny. Like media is getting so annoying. Like she's just hyping it up and it doesn't even say that
they're going to IPO. It's if and if we want to so what she's done with this article with readers is
just simply hype up her company to drive up the value of it even more.
00:34:51:26 - 00:35:10:09
Stefan
And I think it was David who said this, but basically it's smoke and mirrors. It's just like you say
something, you hype it up even more, and it's like we might IPO and it's like, oh crap, we have
to get in. We have to get in. And I bet she's going to happen. They're they're going to have
another funding round of something ridiculous in the next coming months.
00:35:10:11 - 00:35:13:18
Stefan
And this would have helped with it. But this is kind of interesting.
00:35:13:21 - 00:35:20:02
Jens
Yeah. It imagine you had some VCs on the tipping point of investing.
00:35:20:04 - 00:35:24:02
Stefan
Yeah. Like they just missed the last round. Yeah.
00:35:24:04 - 00:35:52:21
Jens
And she's thinking how can I how can I increase the, the price of the secondaries? I'm, I'm
selling if and can, you scroll back up again because she's not even saying anything about it, an
IPO or something. It's more like OpenAI CFO says new structure opens door for potential IPO.
So essentially she said nothing.
00:35:52:24 - 00:36:10:11
Stefan
Oh, I feel like we're in the wrong space. Like we build for our customers. We actually care about
our customers and we build for them. And it's and what I've seen is like, for example, yesterday I
met with this girl. She's helping this other company. They raised a $20 million series A on vision.
Okay. It's a really great vision.
00:36:10:11 - 00:36:31:14
Stefan
It's supposed to help with AI. They just raised an $80 million series A, and I go, oh my God. Like,
how much traction do they have? Like how much how much revenue do they have. Oh, they
don't have any revenue yet. Oh, well, how's the product coming along? Oh, the product's not
done yet. Oh, why did they wait
00:36:31:14 - 00:36:52:00
Stefan
How did they go from 20 to 80 million? Well. What happened? Oh, the vision. I'm like the vision.
Yeah. It's such a grand vision. It's capital intensive. It needs more money. Okay. Did the
founders sell anything on secondaries in between their round? Oh, yeah. Yeah he did. Brother,
this guy just made him himself and his whole generation rich by just selling a vision.
00:36:52:03 - 00:36:55:00
Stefan
Just a vision like I've seen the tech.
00:36:55:05 - 00:36:57:12
Jens
Have you watched Silicon Valley?
00:36:57:14 - 00:36:58:28
Stefan
Yeah, I know the scene with,
00:36:59:01 - 00:36:59:15
Jens
No, no.
00:36:59:15 - 00:37:05:03
Stefan
Do you know what? Oh, no. The most important rule. No revenue. Yeah.
00:37:05:07 - 00:37:06:23
Jens
No revenue.
00:37:06:26 - 00:37:27:09
Stefan
When you put revenue, then it diminishes the dream because revenue will never be enough.
But if you have no revenue, you can constantly sell the dream, which is. Yes, honestly. Second
startup I started absolutely no revenue. It's just going to be vision. Here's the vision. Yeah. Thing
is, though. It's all smoke and mirrors. It's really annoying. But we'll get to it.
00:37:27:09 - 00:37:41:15
Jens
But I also want to say something on the, on the on the other side of the spectrum. So that's a
new project going. It's called Project Starship. Have you heard of Project Starship?
00:37:41:17 - 00:37:44:03
Stefan
No I haven't, should we bring it up? Yeah.
00:37:44:05 - 00:37:47:24
Jens
Google Project Starship.
00:37:47:27 - 00:37:54:13
Stefan
Project Starship on steam no I'm kidding. The one from SpaceX?
00:37:54:16 - 00:37:55:23
Jens
No.
00:37:55:25 - 00:37:57:24
Stefan
Is it from Space-X?
00:37:57:27 - 00:38:05:24
Jens
No, it's from from the US government. Is it called Starship, actually, or am I wrong?
00:38:05:27 - 00:38:09:11
Stefan
It's the super heavy project, but it's being done by SpaceX. Is that it?
00:38:09:13 - 00:38:23:19
Jens
No, no, no, it's it's not that. What's this program by the U.S government to invest into into AI? It's
it's a collaboration of SoftBank. Starlink. No it's SoftBank.
00:38:23:21 - 00:38:27:28
Stefan
It's you know what you're talking star Oracle from OpenAI. It's star Stargate.
00:38:27:28 - 00:38:29:14
Jens
Is it Stargate.
00:38:29:16 - 00:38:33:00
Stefan
Yeah yeah. Hold up I'm bringing it up. It's from OpenAI I remember I.
00:38:33:00 - 00:38:35:01
Jens
Mixed it I mixed it.
00:38:35:03 - 00:38:36:06
Stefan
One sec. Let me re share.
00:38:36:06 - 00:38:37:09
Jens
Stargate.
00:38:37:12 - 00:38:51:19
Stefan
I remember this is like when they announced their latest funding round. They're like. Also, we're
getting 100 billion to deploy the infrastructure immediately. I remember it was also a big turning
point in the election in the US, which was huge.
00:38:51:21 - 00:39:28:17
Jens
Yeah. Okay. So, for the forget about, precedents and everything, the important bit is. So I
watched this, documentary about it. It's a collaboration of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle also
NGX, but not sure what NGX is but essentially and, you don't need to to share, by the way. It's
it's fine, but, it's, it's crazy what they are building and, and I think it is something it's, it's
important to think about what's, what's happening here because I think it has an effect on many
startups.
00:39:28:19 - 00:40:23:23
Jens
Essentially what OpenAI is doing together with Oracle is they build whole data centers. They
build the biggest GPU farm in the, in the world, essentially open AI will will own a huge compute
cluster to predict your tokens. So they are building the biggest hardware platform to give you llm
capabilities. So what that means for any wrapper or anybody who builds a startup with llms, you
need to be extremely careful in what you're building, because I think in the long term, what's
going to happen is you build these wrappers, you build AI tools, open AI will eventually eat up
everything that works, and they will have the hardware.
00:40:23:25 - 00:40:41:06
Jens
So that means if you compete with OpenAI, on the same capability, first of all, they have more
capital. So they can move faster, hire better talent. They can have the rust developers. You only
have the go developers.
00:40:41:08 - 00:41:09:13
Jens
So they have the borrow checker. You don't have to borrow checker. Okay. So that's number
one. But the second thing is well what what will what will happen is, so you build a product and
you will buy from Google, you will buy Germany two point something. And what's going to
happen is you buy this and you resell the token.
00:41:09:16 - 00:41:40:20
Jens
This will be very expensive for you. At the same time, Sam Altman, he will copy your product
and he will run it on his hardware, which is an extreme amount cheaper than than your solution.
So everybody who built something that has the potential, to, to to be a more profitable business
if ran directly on hardware, you're dead.
00:41:40:23 - 00:42:14:29
Jens
And I can tell you here's my prediction for cursor, because I think cursor is absolutely dead in
the future. So here's what I think. What's going to happen? Cursor has this, cursor. OpenAI has
this new thing. It's called Codex. It changes the workflow. And currently the workflow with cursor
is I have cursor running on my local machine, and I open files and I tell cursor what I want to
change, and then it does, calls to OpenAI or to whatever model, and then it will make changes
to the files.
00:42:14:29 - 00:42:40:15
Jens
And this can take some while. And then after all the changes are done, I can review them, and
then I can re prompt and I can make changes. So on so forth. So it's a direct interaction
between the, the user and the code and the AI. So it's it's very much it's a hands on experience.
But with Codex, which is in the very, very early days, I tried it wasn't super, compelled to be
honest.
00:42:40:15 - 00:43:11:06
Jens
It's not yet great, but the not so important. The point is the experience OpenAI is creating, it's
kind of similar to to, the, the copilot experience from from GitHub. You have a code base. You
write a prompt to change the code base in some way, and then this prompt, you hand it off to AI,
AI will handle it in the background, and then will come back with a pull request or something.
00:43:11:06 - 00:43:30:13
Jens
So it will tell you, hey, I made the changes you wanted. You can now review it. So instead of
having cursor as an IDE in front of you, it's more like you can even think about. Let's say you
have like a linear you create a bunch of tasks, you assign it to an AI, and ten minutes later AI
comes back with the pull request.
00:43:30:13 - 00:44:02:20
Jens
You can review it so it's more hands off and it's more automated. And now here's the interesting
question. Currently cursor works. Works, great. Is is, at an advantage because the models are
so weak and slow and it's expensive. What if we can drive the cost down? What if we can drive
the speed up? What if we can build a framework that allows us to to generate this code much
faster in a more hands off way?
00:44:02:22 - 00:44:27:27
Jens
So we need to build an engine which is Codex. That makes it simpler to write code. Hands off.
And then the following happens. So I think for the next, I don't know, 12 months or whatever, I
think, cursor will be, super successful, throughout. And eventually those hands off coders will
take off. They are they are faster.
00:44:27:27 - 00:44:51:03
Jens
They are getting, more done. I think they can do more complex, things. And you can as a
developer, I think you will get more velocity because you don't have to open cursor. You just say,
here's a bunch of work, and then AI does it. And now now is the problem. Cursor is just buying,
AI from others and reselling it.
00:44:51:06 - 00:45:19:21
Jens
But Codex, it will run on the hardware of open AI so you cannot compete with that. So there's no
way like a startup could compete with this just because, cost and hardware is, inaccessible. So
at that point, I think, OpenAI has won the game. And, to be honest, I would actually invest in the,
like, this is not investment advice, but, if they built that, I would invest in it.
00:45:19:24 - 00:45:40:06
Stefan
No, I think you're spot on. But are you not seeing the similarities, though, with like, the past?
This is basically the cloud 2.0. This is AWS. They own the hardware, they lease it out to you and
they build on top. It's also not a bad thing because the cloud created companies like Vercel,
which have 100 million ARR, and they're literally a wrapper on top of AWS.
00:45:40:06 - 00:46:01:21
Stefan
They just improve the experience. And so you're absolutely right. OpenAI is going to completely
own. And Steve Jobs, he has a good quote. The only way you can completely own is if you own
the software and the hardware. Because if you own the hardware there, your margin is zero.
Nobody can get close to your margin. Nobody can. Same thing with Jeff Bezos where he said,
what is it?
00:46:01:24 - 00:46:09:27
Stefan
Your margin is my opportunity. And he owned the margin with AWS. That's a great take. It's a
great take.
00:46:09:29 - 00:46:32:16
Jens
Yeah I'm not sure. Like on the one hand it's a great opportunity. On the other side, what I don't
like about it is I think this can quickly lead to monopolies. And I'm not sure if it's if it's the right
thing for for humanity. If just like OpenAI and 2 or 3 other big companies have hardware and
own LLM.
00:46:32:19 - 00:47:02:24
Jens
Yeah, I think it will be more favorable if if this was, if more startups could have similar
capabilities. But, yeah, I think what, what will end up happening is that, nobody can compete on,
on that level of automation. just because as a startup, you what you what you won't be able to
do is you cannot raise like, I don't know, 100 billion and build a data center.
00:47:02:27 - 00:47:05:07
Jens
Like it's not going to happen.
00:47:05:10 - 00:47:26:17
Stefan
But what about companies like railway? So if you go back, you have AWS and you have
companies like railway that are doing kind of like OpenAI focus on research, but that in the
future is going to hire someone to be the CEO research. And then infra. Yeah, it's kind of crazy.
Jens I think you're spot on and it makes sense.
00:47:26:20 - 00:47:49:24
Stefan
It's weird, like competition and capitalism. You know, it pushes innovation. But at the end of the
day, you're right. Like there are a few companies, like for example, there's Google, Azure and
what is it, AWS. They own the cloud space they completely own it. And this is a $100 billion
market. It's massive. And they just completely own it. The same thing is going to happen in AI.
00:47:49:24 - 00:48:05:12
Stefan
Is it a good thing. Is it a bad thing? Is it going to lead to more innovation I don't know. Will they
are completely own it. Yeah they will. But like for example railway. Do you think that they're
doing successful like they have millions in revenue. They're growing but they're built on top of
AWS. They're just a faster experience.
00:48:05:12 - 00:48:10:24
Stefan
Do you think we'll have more railways before AI. Companys just wrappers. Is that a bad thing?
00:48:10:26 - 00:48:38:03
Jens
Not, not not a bad thing at all. I think at some point there's also the question, what kind of stuff
does openAI want to focus on. Let's say you're OpenAI or Google or someone else. It could be
enough to to just build a good model and, sell it efficiently. And then you have those wrapper
companies who resell it like the, the vercels of AI.
00:48:38:03 - 00:49:09:14
Jens
So to say, I think that that is one thing that that could happen. You know, I think it's a little bit like,
one thing I learned from from Warren Buffett about Berkshire Hathaway is, in terms of investing,
you have to invest in different ways compared to when you are like, let's say you have your
fount sizes 100 K, 100 K, us dollars, like your your personal money or something.
00:49:09:21 - 00:49:35:16
Jens
You invest that in a different way compared to, let's say, you you manage a false fount size of, I
don't know, 200 billion or something. You can't just buy a Coca-Cola overnight or something. It's
it's going to destroy the market. So you have to, to, to behave in a different way. And I think the
same thing is true for, OpenAI and, the big LLM providers or cloud providers.
00:49:35:19 - 00:50:06:12
Jens
I think you also want to have some competition and you want to have users using your, your,
your agents and such. But, one thing we've, we've seen a lot in the recent, recent, I would say
like 12 months or something. In the beginning, there were some startups who built tools on top
of, GitHub with LLMs, and they did like automated pull request reviews or something but now.
00:50:06:15 - 00:50:35:19
Jens
Yeah. But now something happens. Where? Where you see again how important this
distribution, a player like, like Microsoft, Microsoft owns GitHub. So they just observe the market
and they see, okay, someone has built a copilot to review pull requests, but GitHub has better
distribution. So all they do is tell everybody, guys, here's this thing, we call it copilot.
00:50:35:19 - 00:50:45:06
Jens
It can now review your pull request. All you have to do is click on the pull request and invite
copilot as a reviewer.
00:50:45:09 - 00:50:46:17
Stefan
Yeah.
00:50:46:19 - 00:51:10:03
Jens
And yeah, that's also the same reason why, why, for example, Microsoft Teams is more
successful in terms of, of revenue and growth compared to, to slack. Slack is probably the better
application. But over time, Microsoft Teams is just stealing the features and they have better
distribution. So in the end, distribution wins.
00:51:10:06 - 00:51:27:08
Stefan
Now it's fair point. Some guy, posted today actually on LinkedIn, you'll see it. He was just saying
how important it is to build a brand. And I think he misunderstood. Like there's the brand and
there's the distribution. And like we we can talk about the next episode. I do want to save a little
bit of time. So we're working on something new.
00:51:27:10 - 00:51:50:13
Stefan
It's already kind of out version one. We don't know what we're calling it yet. It's a new product.
It's plug ins, it's connectors, it's connect. We're still working on the name, so if you guys have
any suggestions, that'd be great. But yeah, just tell us a little bit about it. Like and we can talk a
little bit about the problem that we see with the famous word GraphQL and where we're going
with this new product.
00:51:50:13 - 00:52:01:08
Stefan
But tell me a little bit about it. I've not been as close to the team that has been building it, but
what first of all, what's the name for it? And second of all, what problem does it solve?
00:52:01:10 - 00:52:34:00
Jens
So so currently the name is plugins. But I think the name is it's not yet the right name. We're
we're taking it slow. It's not so important to figure out the right name. But at this time, let's, let's
say it's just plugins. Okay. So here's the problem we're solving. I think for us, for our customers,
for hopefully our viewers as well, the value of a super graph is super clear.
00:52:34:03 - 00:52:58:07
Jens
So super graph if you if you know us, we have a single, GraphQL API and it brings together all
your, all your APIs so that, that is, for us, it is proven that it is much better to have a single
monolithic graph than having 1500 rest API points that you somehow stick into backstage.
00:52:58:07 - 00:53:22:06
Jens
And then it's it's very hard to use and it's it's hard to find the right API. And then you have to
manually integrate it. So, you can waste a lot of resources doing that. So the value is clear.
Super graph. Is awesome. The problem is GraphQL. And we we've been talking about this in
the past. We believe federation is a great concept.
00:53:22:06 - 00:53:53:06
Jens
So federation as a as a concept where you just say okay I have a monolithic API and I split it
into multiple parts to make it manageable and to make it scalable across multiple teams. So for
us that is federation. Federation for us. What it's not it's not tied to GraphQL. And we also think
that that potentially one of the biggest adoption hurdles for Federation is GraphQL because you
force everybody to do, GraphQL.
00:53:53:06 - 00:54:21:00
Jens
Well, while, the real value comes from Federation. Okay. So let's talk about the plugin system
we have built because, you know, if you, if you if you know us a little bit, we're extremely
customer focused. We absolutely love to, to pair up with our customers. And we have like,
regular catch ups every, every week, every second week with them.
00:54:21:01 - 00:54:45:28
Jens
And we try to figure out, okay, well what is the well, how can we help you. So federation is great.
GraphQL an adoption hurdle. How can we help our customers to bring all their legacy REST
APIs? Everything that is not yet, a GraphQL subgraph. How can we bring that to the graph so
that they that they can, can leverage it?
00:54:46:00 - 00:55:12:00
Jens
And the architecture or the solution we came up is, it's actually very interesting because I would
say we we this is one of my, blog posts we will publish soon. We accidentally created a backend
framework for LLMs. And so, what we did is we created a workflow where you define, a schema
for, federation subgraph.
00:55:12:02 - 00:55:51:09
Jens
You take the schema, you run it through a compiler, and the compiler turns the GraphQL SDL
into a protobuf definition for a gRPC service. And, essentially what we're doing is we take
GraphQL federation, we take the subgraph out of the subgraph, and we move the subgraph into
the router. So that means from a subgraph perspective, all you have to do is you implement a
gRPC spec and then youre, you're essentially done.
00:55:51:11 - 00:56:16:01
Jens
And now the the last part we had to solve is okay, where do we actually run this. Because it's
more or less like a proxy function. And we, we don't really want to to have you run a separate
service for it. It would just complicate the thing. Imagine you have 1500 REST API endpoints.
Do you want to to run like 500 or something.
00:56:16:03 - 00:56:43:19
Jens
Backends just to proxy. No you probably don't. Okay. So what we figured out is there's, a
solution, from from HashiCorp. It's an open source library. It's called, goplugin. And what it
allows you to do is you have a host process, in our case, the router. You give it the plugins,
which are, they are, compiled, go, go, applications.
00:56:43:19 - 00:57:08:23
Jens
So they are binaries essentially. And the main component, the router, it will have, it will manage
the lifecycle of these plugins. So it will start them and connect to them, etc.. And then what
happens is between the router and the plugin we have a Unix domain socket which we use to
very efficiently talk gRPC, which is also secure.
00:57:08:25 - 00:57:33:01
Jens
And then as a result the workflow we can now do this if we want to add a Rest API or a Soap
API or, an Excel spreadsheet, or it doesn't really matter what, we create a schema and this
schema, we then run through the compiler. Now we have the gRPC plugin interface, the the the
protobuf.
00:57:33:03 - 00:58:20:01
Jens
And we have figured out how to use, cursor to build, certain cursor rules that really constrain
what the llm should do. And with those cursor rules, you can give cursor a single prompt and it
will implement for you a proxy from any JSON, http, API, to your, to your, to the gRPC protocol.
And yeah, what, what the benefit of that is essentially we can we can now drive the cost of
adopting a super graph to, to more or less, zero because it, it costs you a prompt or two, to
migrate an endpoint to, to the super graph.
00:58:20:01 - 00:58:51:17
Jens
And it's, super easy to do. And if you compare it to other solutions, there's for example,
connectors from Apollo. The problem with connectors is it's, it's a declarative way. You have like
directives you put into the schema. And we can like next tine. We can also talk more about that.
But you have these directives. You put them into the schema and then you don't exactly know if,
if if it's right is it working with our approach you can just write tests and you can you can see is it
is it working.
00:58:51:17 - 00:59:21:01
Jens
You can mock the API. And this declarative approach, it simply doesn't align very well with, with
AI because, what we do is you define the contract and you do give a very good prompt to an
llm. What to do. And it really doesn't it, it doesn't depend on what kind of API you have. If your
API supports batching, for example, we one problem we have to solve is the N plus one
problem.
00:59:21:01 - 00:59:42:18
Jens
Like if you have a list of items and for each item you have to fetch another thing. If your rest API
supports batching, that is very possible. The problem will be this it. It won't be following some
specific spec, so you can't just build out-of-the-box features. To support that, you need to
somehow build an adapter.
00:59:42:20 - 01:00:28:28
Jens
And this adapter. Ideally it would look at the open API spec or whatever you have from your
service and then writes code to adapt it. And this is a perfect task for for LLM. And so to tie this
back to like the the wider story, what we've been talking about before, I really believe the, the
future of, of backend development is that we will see more and more backend frameworks that
are designed to, to be used together with LLMs, where the engineer is not just like using
autocompletion or not even using like agent mode or something and cursor, but I think we will in
the future we will see backend frameworks where you can
01:00:28:28 - 01:00:57:06
Jens
you can essentially define your specification. You can then prompt the solution to implement this
new functionality in a certain way using a certain database or something. And then there will be,
a process that generates this, this code. And then yeah, then there's the question, why? Why
even manually write code or why? Why use cursor if you can automate it?
01:00:57:08 - 01:01:05:06
Stefan
in rust, right.
I was going to say is when we tie this all back, this new future, this plugin system, it's all written
01:01:05:08 - 01:01:08:19
Jens
So it's written in go.
01:01:08:22 - 01:01:25:08
Stefan
Just messing around, imagine though, we bring that whole debate and then we go full circle and
then we say this new plugin system, by the way, is written in rust. No, I'm kidding, we only raised
to 7.5, series A, not a 35, so we can't afford the rust developers. Jokes aside, guys, thank you
so much for joining us today.
01:01:25:08 - 01:01:30:25
Stefan
We are at the hour mark, but Jens, what's the good thing?
01:01:30:28 - 01:01:34:01
Jens
Good thing we're back in a week.
01:01:34:03 - 01:01:38:22
Stefan
We're back in a week. Thanks, guys. Have a good one. You sure you don't?
