00:35:48:09 - 00:36:14:00
Jens
We want to to solve like the, the, the real problem. And I think what is what is super important or
like one way I think about it is you can have different classes of problems you're solving. So it's
it's like, you, you can solve like a day one problem, but you can also solve like a day three
problem.
00:36:14:03 - 00:36:35:10
Jens
And I would say like day one, it's kind of like you're, you're an outsider to the market. Like
obviously everybody is sees themselves as an insider. So so you think you you know, it. And
you have an assumption about the market. So you talk to some people, you, you, you try to
figure out what, what does the market want.
00:36:35:10 - 00:37:10:01
Jens
You you interview people and maybe you get them to pay for something like what you just
described with zip. But still, I think it is it is really hard to to get to the nitty gritty when you are an
outsider. So in our case, I think where the, the real benefit is, and this is something you can do
on day three and then like if you if you are past like seed stage, I think you should absolutely
build a TAB and you should start trying to zoom out of your own solution.
00:37:10:04 - 00:37:38:21
Jens
So like the, the, the first step in the, in the TAB and the most important step is you can you can
read books like mom test and whatever these are these are kind of good to to give you a little bit
of a structure on on how to conduct these meetings, but I think one super important point is you
need to zoom out of your solution, and you need to just stop thinking about what you're doing
because you're, you're you're going to be so biased.
00:37:38:25 - 00:38:03:28
Jens
And it's it's even possible if you if you cannot do it in an unbiased way, just hire someone
external to, to do this. Because the less you know about your solution, the more you know, if
you're thinking in your solution, you try to connect it to everything they have. And it's like, okay,
we have Cosmo. How can we solve all your problems with Cosmo?
00:38:04:00 - 00:38:25:01
Jens
And it's it's going to be very tough to find real gold. What what you what you rather want to do is
you want to see. Okay, we have Cosmo. It's Federation stuff. It's API stuff. So obviously we're
not going to build a car or something, so we won't ask how people commute to work like this is
not like a problem.
00:38:25:04 - 00:38:50:03
Jens
But what we can do is we can take Cosmo and we can ask them, like, how are you using
Cosmo? And then they they talk about what they do with it and they build digital products or
whatever. Like a lot of our customers, it's the nature of GraphQL. They do, B2C digital
applications like web and mobile.
00:38:50:05 - 00:39:15:17
Jens
Okay. And because so that's GraphQL and because it's federation, it means multiple teams. So
teams need to work together. So that is like two, two things that are kind of super obvious. And
and from there you can zoom out a little bit and you can you can just ask people like okay,
you're building B2C apps and you're doing it with multiple teams.
00:39:15:17 - 00:39:43:21
Jens
So then you ask them, how are you doing it and what are the steps? And then you asked, what
are the people involved and what are the, who are the stakeholders? And then you learn, okay,
that's like product owner, developers, etc., etc.. So you try to map out who are the people, and
then you try to map out what are they doing, what is their day to day and, and what are their,
their top priorities.
00:39:43:24 - 00:40:10:18
Jens
You know, everybody has like a to do list. The question is how do you get to the to the to the
point where they, they, they completely skip that to do list. And the number one thing they put on
top is buying your solution because it solves their, their pain. And so in the end TABbing it's I
don't know I think it's it's a lot of fun.
00:40:10:21 - 00:40:37:16
Jens
You you can you can explore how how your customers behave. And then where were the goals
can be. And then I think, if you start with your TAB, where you want to get at is you want to find
overlap, because how can you, how can you bring your company to an inflection point where it
rapidly growth grows like this?
00:40:37:16 - 00:40:59:18
Jens
You know, this hockey stick point, how do you find this corner? And I would say the important bit
here in the TAB is and I will stop after that. Maybe you have some smarts, but the the important
bit is if you find a certain behavior in one of your customers and you were like this, this could be
our ICP.
00:40:59:18 - 00:41:24:24
Jens
I see this is this could work out. Then you go to similar customer, similar customer profile,
similar behavior. And you're trying to like again, you're not biased. You just ask them essentially
the same questions. And what you are trying to find is that they will give you, at least in some
parts, the same answer or a very similar answer.
00:41:24:27 - 00:41:46:28
Jens
So then you can take these stories. You lay them over each other like one story over each other.
And you see, you know, like a heat map, how this thing, it gets warmer and warmer and that and
that's and at some point you're just like, Holy shit, we we have found it like this. This is a
repeaTABle pattern.
00:41:46:28 - 00:42:16:18
Jens
We, we, we have now figured out, like here, here's a pain point. Nobody is addressing that.
They are using other tool that is not supposed to solve this problem. And they are they are
handcrafting a solution. And we see this across all of them or across all ICP. And then, yeah, not
now. You're you're in territory where we're at that point you, you can think about, okay, how can
we how can we solve this problem?
00:42:16:20 - 00:42:33:16
Stefan
I think you're spot on. It's you're looking for the patterns, but it's really important that you read
them, test or at least just kind of understand how to ask these questions. You don't want to bias
them with your solution. Like, totally forget about your solution, totally forget about your
company, and just really talk to the person and understand what they're doing.
00:42:33:18 - 00:42:50:23
Stefan
Keep it within the same context of like what are their biggest pain points, but also like within the
context of where you are as a company. But do you want to completely remove your solution
from it? And I think what's important, by the way, is, the TAB is who you invite. You want to make
sure that on the TAB is.
00:42:51:00 - 00:42:51:16
Jens
All.
00:42:51:16 - 00:43:16:03
Stefan
People that you have a, you know, not it doesn't have to be a close relationship with because,
you know, if there's people that you're just starting out your software, you're not going to have a
close relationship with them, but it's people that could potentially benefit from your solution, not
a buyer, but potentially benefit from them. Because one, if you're starting out, this allows you a
very easy, a cost effective way before you put years into something that's not going to work is to
understand is this even worth doing for somebody?
00:43:16:06 - 00:43:38:15
Stefan
Because everybody in life, especially with work, they have a to do list of topics. And Jens is
never ending. Dustin's. That's even more never ending. I have my list of to do, but at the very
top there's three three things that are my most important thing. And if somebody were to come
along and say, hey, that number one thing that you have, I actually have a solution to your
problem, I'm going to listen and I'm going to see what it is.
00:43:38:21 - 00:43:51:22
Stefan
And if it's a big enough pain, I'm going to pay for it. And what's really important about the TAB is
the creating this board of people. And what you'll start to slowly realize is, whoa, customer A had
that problem. Let me go talk to customer B about it.
00:43:51:28 - 00:43:52:20
Jens
Whoa.
00:43:52:23 - 00:44:08:29
Stefan
Customer B also has that problem. Customer C whoa. Like this is very interesting. And it kind of
feels like I was telling Jens about this. It kind of feels like we're a pirate and we're going a
different islands and we're digging and we're digging, we're digging. We found a little gold coin,
and then we find another gold coin.
00:44:09:01 - 00:44:32:13
Stefan
In product market fit is finding that gold chest because you went and you've talked to all these
people. You've got a gold coin, you follow the treasure and then now you're a product market fit,
which is that hockey stick growth. Because odds are if ten people are experiencing the exact
same issue and it's very top of mind for them, I mean, just a law of effect there is that there's
probably hundreds of people or thousands of companies that are very much experiencing this
problem.
00:44:32:15 - 00:44:35:22
Stefan
And but what's really important here, though, is, Jens, how do you.
00:44:35:22 - 00:44:37:03
Jens
Know.
00:44:37:06 - 00:44:58:06
Stefan
When you know, this is a really good one is these people, we know them. We have a great
relationship with this. They don't want to hurt our feelings. Nobody in life wants to hurt people's
feelings. But how do you know to build what people actually want versus what we think that they
want? How do we find that that this is I am being honest with you because people will lie to you
to be nice, to be like, oh, I love your product.
00:44:58:06 - 00:45:08:13
Stefan
And it's like in your head, you think that's bullshit? Keep telling me more and more and more
about how do you know to build something that they actually want versus what they're telling us,
what we want to hear.
00:45:08:15 - 00:45:30:01
Jens
Yeah, yeah, I think that's a very important question because, if you have existing relationships
with people, the nature of humans is we don't want to hurt others. We don't want to hurt their
feelings. Okay? So some people do, but, generally, we don't want to do it.
00:45:30:03 - 00:45:33:21
Stefan
The guy from the bank, remember?
00:45:33:23 - 00:45:58:23
Jens
Oh, the. That's, That's a funny we got humiliated by. But it was so funny. My my pitch was, we
we help companies ship faster. And he said, oh, we don't want to do that. We just want to ship
six times a year. And, yeah, at that point, it was very clear we're we're not a fit like, we we help
people build better APIs.
00:45:58:23 - 00:46:28:22
Jens
And he was like, oh, our our API strategy is kind of static. And I said, oh, okay. If your API
strategy is static, then, I think you you have not yet looked into AI and what's going on, but okay.
That's fine. So, people don't want to hurt your feelings. So they will lie to you and not not
because they are liars, but because they are humans.
00:46:28:24 - 00:46:50:00
Jens
So I think it's super important that that you that you tell them like, hey, and you, you need to
keep reiterating that. Hey, like, for forget about Cosmo. Just, just tell me. Just, you know, just if
you if you hate Cosmo, it's fine. Just just tell me about it. Or and and you just move. Just move
away.
00:46:50:00 - 00:47:15:12
Jens
The conversation from Cosmo. And I think also the most important thing, don't talk with your
TAB about solution-izing because it's it's not about like if you asked them what what to build,
they will say, yeah, make Cosmo Foster or something. But what is really interesting is talk with
your TAB about their their life, their pains, their workflows, their problems.
00:47:15:18 - 00:47:36:20
Jens
Just talk about the problems. Don't talk about the solution. It won't lead to anything because,
they have to the day to day, they, they typically they are unable to to zoom out and see the big
picture because they are not talking to ten companies about the same workflow. They just know,
oh, I have a ticket in, in Jira.
00:47:36:20 - 00:47:56:23
Jens
I have to ship it this Friday. And I cannot make it forward because the backend developer is is
off and they should have implemented the backend. I'm the front ender, but I'm blocked and now
I cannot move on. So you know what? I'm just gonna vibe code some stuff, and I will spend
some time on YouTube.
00:47:56:23 - 00:48:23:18
Jens
And next Monday I will tell the, the product owner and the daily scrum that I'm blocked, and then
that's going to be fine, you know? So that's one part. Yeah. To reiterate, make sure that that's,
tell them they can. It's fine if they, if if they, if they tell the truth, then don't talk about the solution.
00:48:23:18 - 00:48:57:12
Jens
Talk about the pains. And I think towards the end, if you if you are at the point, how do you feel?
What. Okay. Let's talk about that later. So towards the end, let's say you're, you're in the phase
of so you have feedback, you know, here's something. So then you build the prototype or you
build whatever and you, you you do something, you create something, you create a mock
whatever.
00:48:57:15 - 00:49:28:07
Jens
In the first session, you don't show anything. You just explore. Maybe you need a second
session to explore. And then in the third session, the which would be like week 4 or 6, you
should have something, a presentation, a deck. mocks. Maybe you have a product in the
making, raw product. Okay. You show the product, you get some feedback and you, you just
see how people react.
00:49:28:09 - 00:49:58:26
Jens
And then it's it's super simple. Will your company buy it? And I think this is the most important
thing. Sales. It's not so much about selling in this case. In a, in a TAB, right. If you are not asking
if they would buy it, then how do you know if there's real interest? Like, you know, you you can
you can ask people like what are your pains, what are your problems?
00:49:58:26 - 00:50:21:16
Jens
And they can talk hours and days and weeks about all the problems. Will they will they buy a
solution to solve the problem? That's a that's a real question. So if there's no buying intent, if
they are, you know, let's say they're buying process is they are an engineer. They don't have
buying power. They need to go to the decision maker.
00:50:21:18 - 00:50:46:16
Jens
So the first thing you can try in the TAB is, hey, here's the product we're building. Is this solving
your pain? And then they say, yes, it's it's amazing. And you say okay, awesome. Would you buy
it? And they say, well, I cannot make this decision. I have to I need to go to Joe. And then you
ask, would you bring Joe to the next TAB?
00:50:46:16 - 00:51:11:03
Jens
Can we talk to him? And they say, you know, what's, I, I think that's too complicated. So they are
not willing to convince their manager to buy this. So are you solving that, really? Like, how
important is it to them? Probably not so important. So you want other reactions. You want a
reaction like, oh, this is fantastic.
00:51:11:05 - 00:51:33:14
Jens
Can I try it like let me try it. And then then if they want to try it, you can, you can, you can be,
sneaky about it. You can build hurdles. You know, it's not always important that people pay you.
Like sometimes they can pay with money. But in the early stages, you can also pay in different
ways.
00:51:33:17 - 00:52:06:11
Jens
For example, you can you can ask them, can you connect us to procurement or can you send
your MSA or whatever? I just come up with an idea. What could they do? Just figure out
something they could do so they get access to the beta? What do I get? And the whole purpose
of that is to to get them to the point where they have to act, because if they act, you know, it's
somehow it has enough importance for them.
00:52:06:11 - 00:52:36:04
Jens
If they if if you say can, can you send me an intro to your manager? And they say, you know
what, he's very busy then. Then you know, okay, so it's not super important to you and that's,
that's kind of telling. And then you can have all sorts of in-betweens. Like you can ask people
like, will you buy, will you pay, will you do a beta will like just try to get something from them.
00:52:36:07 - 00:52:39:12
Jens
Stefan any comments? Well.
00:52:39:15 - 00:53:01:10
Stefan
I've experienced this and I think it's just kind of anything like so life is all about selling and Sam
Altman has a very good blog post like how to be successful. And I think the third thing on there
is selling, because everything you do in life is selling. It's selling yourself or a job selling yourself
to buy a purchasing a new house, and why they should lower the rate for you when you go buy
something.
00:53:01:10 - 00:53:15:10
Stefan
Yeah, everything is a negotiation when you talk with people, when you talk to kids, you're
negotiating them. You need to go to bed now. I don't want to go to bed now. Why do you need to
go to bed now? You're trying to convince them and you're literally selling them the dream of bed
and a good night's sleep and everything.
00:53:15:10 - 00:53:41:24
Stefan
And so when you think about it, everything in life is selling. But the important thing about that
part is understanding what the other person wants. And from our point of view, like, yes, we are
a for profit company, but if you take the profit away, the biggest thing about our sales cycle is
that it starts actually after the deal we sell to customers afterwards, which is we want them to be
successful with the platform and we want them to be, you know, entertained when they're using
the tool.
00:53:41:26 - 00:54:00:03
Stefan
They like it. But the second part is, is that they're actually getting value out of it. And I like what
you said is that it has to be like a symbiotic relationship. I give you something, you give me
something, I give you something, you give me something. Whether that's feedback, whether
that's money, whether that's an introduction to your team and all of these.
00:54:00:09 - 00:54:17:10
Stefan
Yeah. Access. All of these, by the way, are like a relationship. I give you this, you give me that. I
invite you to my house for dinner. You invite me to your house for dinner. And before you know
it, we're very close friends and sales, literally, that is that you're selling to this person and you're
understanding what they want and what they want to get.
00:54:17:10 - 00:54:32:21
Stefan
But one of the things I want to get to is I was thinking back on my times when I was an engineer,
I had no buying power. I just like if I wanted to buy JetBrains, I could just go buy it. I had to go
ask my CISO, hey, I really like JetBrains. Can I use it? Okay, well, why do you want it?
00:54:32:21 - 00:54:57:27
Stefan
Well, I like the global search function. I like this, I like that, okay, let me think about it. And I think
it's really important to understand is when you're selling to people, you need to find the person
that can actually make decisions. And if this is a top of mind problem for them, and the TAB
actually helps you understand that, because if you remember, we have a diverse people in the
TAB, and a junior engineer might love the product, but he can't buy it.
00:54:57:29 - 00:55:13:12
Stefan
But what can you learn from the junior engineer? You can learn, oh, he might love the product.
Who does he need to go talk to? He probably go talk to his manager. His manager probably
goes talks to his director. The director probably talks the CTO. And you're able to quickly map
out the journey. But I really like what you said.
00:55:13:12 - 00:55:34:07
Stefan
And I think it's really important is they're not hurdles. They kind of are hurdles, but I see them
more of like a handshake. I give you my product, you give me feedback. Okay. You want to go a
little bit further? I'll give you trial. You give me access to procurement, okay? And each of these,
when they break, it tells you right away it's a filter really, if you will, to filter that.
00:55:34:07 - 00:55:48:04
Stefan
Hey, this person will probably never buy my solution and that's okay. I'm just not a fit for him. But
there's a lot you can learn from the TAB based on all the TABs that we've done currently. I think
we've been doing it just for two weeks. What are some of the most interesting things that you've
learned about these companies?
00:55:48:04 - 00:55:54:06
Stefan
And you don't have to say the company could just say the company size, but what are some
really interesting things that you've learned?
00:55:54:09 - 00:55:59:04
Jens
Ask me again, because first I have to make a funny comment.
00:55:59:06 - 00:56:01:14
Stefan
What is it? What is it about the kids?
00:56:01:16 - 00:56:11:27
Jens
You you mentioned everything is in negotiation and you said even, even. Why is this go black?
This is so weird. I don't.
00:56:12:00 - 00:56:12:26
Stefan
Okay, I'm moving a.
00:56:13:02 - 00:56:16:01
Jens
Little bit forward. Okay.
00:56:16:03 - 00:56:20:26
Stefan
Yeah. Was there the forward. There you go. There you go.
00:56:20:29 - 00:56:32:05
Jens
You said everything is in negotiation. Also bringing kids to bed. Oh, okay. I think it's so clear that
you don't have kids.
00:56:32:07 - 00:56:36:04
Stefan
What do you mean? It's a total negotiation. You're trying to convince them. It's.
00:56:36:10 - 00:57:08:10
Jens
It's not a negotiation. It's like you're you're working with a psychopath or someone, you know,
like, just. Just yesterday I brought Liona to bed and, you know, so here's the playbook. You
bring her to bed, you say, now, now it's sleeping time. And, she's like, when, when I so I, I, I
typically cuddle with or something and then we talk a bit and then I stay up.
00:57:08:13 - 00:57:34:16
Jens
And then her first move is, Jens. Or. Dad, you you have to rearrange my covers. So the so the,
the blanket, like, I have to rearrange the, the blanket. Okay. I rearrange the blanket. Okay. Let's
do that. So I go out. She's, she's starts crying. Okay, okay. Next level. Then you try to offer, like,
okay, do you want to drink something or whatever?
00:57:34:16 - 00:57:57:27
Jens
Okay. You you bring something to drink? Okay, good. She doing something? I go outside, she
starts crying again and I'm like, oh come on. Well, well what do you need? I, I don't want to be
alone. Like, come on. Every, every kid sleeps a lot like we're we're in the other room. And then,
Yeah, then, then next level.
00:57:57:29 - 00:58:35:18
Jens
She, she still cannot stop. And then I want to see mom, and I'm like, okay, but we we we don't
want to play this game. So you can see like with, with customers if they want to buy something
like but but you know, with, with kids sometimes there's the like there's literally nothing you can
do because you, you, you know, I, I don't know how this is in America, but in German, in, in
Germany, like the, the new culture is where like, you know, when, when I was a kid, it was
normal to to hit a kid when they misbehave.
00:58:35:21 - 00:58:36:18
Jens
And,
00:58:36:20 - 00:58:40:26
Stefan
My dad, by the way, in Serbian culture, he could beat me if I was bad.
00:58:40:28 - 00:59:06:10
Jens
Currently here, the the culture is you. You you don't use force against kids. Not. Not in words,
not with with your hands, whatever. And so there's this, this typically like a point where you
reach this point and you're like, okay, you if you don't do this, you cannot watch Peppa Pig or
whatever. And then your kid is like, yeah, that's fine, I don't care.
00:59:06:10 - 00:59:26:27
Jens
I don't want to watch it. And you're like, okay, shit. Like, what are we going to do next? And so
so that's what is to say. Like, I, I will, I will have a lot of fun when, when you have your first kids
because you will realize that negotiation with enterprises is so simple.
00:59:27:00 - 00:59:37:18
Stefan
Have you ever seen that meme where, like, this guy, like, was on a negotiation and he goes, we
don't negotiate with terrorists. And just so is that how it is with kids? You just shut the door and
you're just like, go to bed.
00:59:37:20 - 00:59:43:00
Jens
That's the same thing with with kids. Okay, back to your question. And then we end the stream.
00:59:43:02 - 01:00:02:04
Stefan
Yeah. What are some of the biggest findings or from the TAB that you've learned in the first two
weeks? Because I know we've all seen some cool tooling with like AI to kind of filter through it.
But what have you learned from these companies? And just for context, for the viewers, these
are fortune 500 companies. These are emerging healthcare startups.
01:00:02:04 - 01:00:17:23
Stefan
These are some public companies in, Europe. There's companies all over from 50 engineers to
1000 engineers to even more think like 10,000, something crazy like that. But what have you
learned across all these companies?
01:00:17:25 - 01:00:23:21
Jens
Can you give me some some hints? What I'm allowed to say. You could tease.
01:00:23:21 - 01:00:46:19
Stefan
A little bit of what we're building. Don't say any of the company's names. Don't say any of the
companies like, positions. But what are you noticing that companies are doing? Like, they're
they're bringing together a bunch of tools. For what? And and you can hint a little bit on that. You
can hint a little bit on like the biggest problem that companies are doing maybe don't say the
tooling that we're going to go against.
01:00:46:21 - 01:00:59:16
Stefan
But oh, it's interesting that people are using tools in a way that they're not supposed to be used,
you know, but just keep a high level or we can end it right here as like a cliffhanger for the
audience,
01:00:59:18 - 01:01:34:01
Jens
Okay. So if we start with GraphQL Federation, what we're doing is we're building APIs, and then
you have to ask yourself the question, why are people building APIs? They build digital
products. A lot of our customers are B2C. And so you then have to understand what is the
process behind building these products. And we kind of realize that Cosmo is somewhere in this
in this journey.
01:01:34:03 - 01:02:13:02
Jens
It's it's, one I really need to work on this. It's it's it's one part of of of the big puzzle. It's one part
of of the journey. And we we figured out that this whole journey from product idea to product in
production, it's completely disconnected and there's like, so many people involved in. Yeah.
How do we bring this, this idea into the graph and then the graph into the front end applications
or whatever, or we connect it with MCP to AI or this kind of stuff.
01:02:13:05 - 01:02:50:18
Jens
And so there's a lot of people involved and there's a lot of collaboration involved. You have
sometimes you have designers who build UI mocks. Then you have discussions about user
flows. Then you somehow try to connect these flows and, the UI sketches, you try to somehow
connect this to, to API design and then you deploy it and then or well, first maybe you mock it,
then you deploy it and production, blah, blah, blah.
01:02:50:21 - 01:03:24:24
Jens
But what we have kind of figured out that this, this whole journey is completely disconnected.
And yeah, I would say for me the most confusing thing is that and I and like, I don't want to to
boil we can you know the names but oh and how in hell is it possible that the whole competition
is completely ignoring what the market is trying to do, or what what our customers are trying to
do?
01:03:24:27 - 01:03:53:19
Jens
Everybody is is so focused on GraphQL. Everybody's so focused on, I don't know, there's, you
know, there's maybe this is a little bit of a rant, but there's working groups on on how to how to
reinvent federation, how to add new directives for, for federation. And, and I think this is not this
is not the real problem. We don't need another version of Federation.
01:03:53:19 - 01:04:36:02
Jens
We don't need a better version of federation. We need to zoom out. And we need to understand
that federation as it is. It's it's okay. But also REST APIs is okay. But ultimately, this whole
journey, how can we make it easier for people to go from product idea to product reality? And if
you think about this, you kind of realize that, I don't know, but just just building a supergraph and
splitting it up into subgraphs and then using GraphQL in the front end, it's not going to cut it like
this is good, like nothing is wrong with it.
01:04:36:04 - 01:05:00:04
Jens
And I can give you many reasons why why Federation is great and I can give you more reasons
why. I think for a lot of B2C front end driven solutions, I think GraphQL and things like relay is
absolutely fantastic and I definitely recommend it, especially when you have like multiple teams
working on multiple products. Back end, front end.
01:05:00:04 - 01:05:26:22
Jens
So I, I believe like GraphQL Federation is a is a good architecture. It's a good pattern. But we're
not solving we're not solving the whole journey. And this is something that that wundergraph will
focus much more in the future. We want we want to connect the different the different parts of
the journey. And we want to focus on the on the overall journey.
01:05:27:00 - 01:05:56:06
Jens
It doesn't mean that we're de focusing from from Cosmo. Quite the opposite. So we're investing
more and more. We're, we're, making the team bigger and stronger. But, ultimately, I, I, you
know, I think and this is something it's it's for me, it's a personal journey, but over the last couple
of years, I, you know, if you know my past, I started with GraphQL go tools.
01:05:56:06 - 01:06:24:28
Jens
So I, I'm, I'm the engineer here. I'm the technical founder. Stefan is the business guy. I started
with an open source library to build GraphQL gateways because I thought that's an interesting
problem to solve. And over the lead over the last couple of years, I kind of came to the point
that, okay, GraphQL is cool. Federation is cool, but I want to solve I want to solve organizational
problems.
01:06:24:28 - 01:07:01:11
Jens
I want to solve like really high impact problems. And for me, that means I want to help
organizations build products faster. And that really, that really drives me. That drives the whole
company now. And, I think we're we're going in a super interesting, direction because what I,
you know, what I was struggling with in the past is how how can you justify, ACVS and your
contract values of hundreds of thousands or even millions?
01:07:01:14 - 01:07:28:11
Jens
And the point is, you can't just make something proprietary and then say, like, hey, it's hard to do
or it's scarce or whatever, and it's going to cost 500 K. It's it doesn't feel right. So there needs to
be tremendous value. And so, when, when, you know, when, when I was starting with, with
startups, initially I was like, I want to make money.
01:07:28:14 - 01:07:54:01
Jens
And now I'm, I'm, I kind of transitioned into I want to I want to create value. And I think if you
create value, if you if you bring a valuable solution to others, money will follow. But the focus
needs to be on on the value and for for us through the, through our activities with the Technical
Advisory Board, it's very clear where the where the value is.
01:07:54:01 - 01:08:24:24
Jens
And then I can only encourage every founder to step back from your solution, and, talk more
with your customers, dive deeper into what is the real pain. And once you figure out pains, you
try to to find patterns. And once you find patterns, you you build a prototype, you show a
solution, and then you try to get commitment that people are willing to to pay for that.
01:08:24:24 - 01:08:29:00
Jens
And then you might be on to something well said.
01:08:29:00 - 01:08:44:10
Stefan
So I think it's a perfect place to end the podcast. So guys, thank you so much for joining us.
We're really excited about the next couple of episodes coming forward. Next week, we're going
to have a special guest. Actually, somebody who was on our time was building some exciting
stuff at a public company, and he's going to be joining us next week.
01:08:44:10 - 01:09:03:27
Stefan
So tune in for that guest episode. We're going to try having more guests on to the podcast as
well, because finally, our content producer is full time. We've been messing with him this whole
time, but he's finally full time, which is amazing. So expect more content from us. We're really
excited. And, Jens, what's the good thing? We're back next week.
01:09:03:29 - 01:09:12:07
Stefan
The good thing is we're back next week. Only on the N scale support package ends enterprise.
So that's a good one. I'd probably say support package.
01:09:12:10 - 01:09:18:20
Jens
Yeah. I think she's like, secret board member and she.
01:09:18:20 - 01:09:19:23
Stefan
Dictates what happens.
01:09:19:25 - 01:09:23:27
Jens
Tickets. Kids control your life. That's awesome.
01:09:23:28 - 01:09:28:27
Stefan
Well, guys, see you next week. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day or great evening.
