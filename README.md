# The Good Thing Podcast Transcript Chunking

## Overview

This repository contains full transcripts of "The Good Thing" podcast, as well as "chunked" versions of each episode. The goal is to break down long podcast transcripts into smaller, structured, and metadata-rich chunks suitable for insertion into a knowledge base or for use in downstream applications (e.g., search, summarization, LLMs).

---

## Directory Structure

- `epXX-full.md`: The full, unprocessed transcript for episode XX.
- `epXX/`: Directory containing chunked `.md` files for episode XX.
  - Each file represents a single chunk (a segment of the episode).

Example:
```
chunks/
  ep01-full.md
  ep01/
    ep01-01-intro-podcast-origins-tradeoffs.md
    ep01-02-jens-accident-resilience-monoskiing.md
    ...
  ep02-full.md
  ep02/
    ep02-01-intro-retreat-norway.md
    ...
```

## What is a "Chunk"?

A chunk is a small, self-contained segment of the podcast transcript, typically corresponding to a single topic, story, or discussion segment. Each chunk includes:

- **YAML frontmatter** with rich metadata
- The **verbatim transcript** for that segment

## Chunking Instructions

### 1. Read the Full Transcript

Open the relevant `epXX-full.md` file. Read through the transcript and identify natural breakpoints—topic changes, new stories, or significant shifts in the conversation.

### 2. Define Chunks

- Each chunk should be **coherent and self-contained** (usually 2–8 minutes of audio, but use your judgment).
- Chunks should not be too short (avoid splitting every speaker turn) or too long (avoid 10+ minute blocks).

### 3. Create Chunk Files

For each chunk:

1. **Create a new file** in the appropriate episode directory (e.g., `ep04/ep04-01-topic-title.md`).
2. **Add YAML frontmatter** at the top, including:
   - `title`: Short, descriptive title for the chunk.
   - `slug`: Unique identifier (e.g., `ep04-01-topic-title`).
   - `series`: Always `"The Good Thing"`.
   - `episode`: Episode number.
   - `chunk`: Chunk number (sequential, starting from 1).
   - `participants`: List of people in the segment.
   - `segment`: Short description of the segment.
   - `timecode`, `start_time`, `end_time`: Use transcript timestamps.
   - `speakers`: List of speakers in the chunk.
   - `topics`: Bullet list of main topics discussed.
   - `tags`: Short tags for search/discovery.
   - `entities`: People, companies, or products mentioned.
   - `mentions`: Notable references, anecdotes, or recurring themes.
   - `summary`: 1–3 sentence summary of the chunk (in plain English).

3. **Paste the transcript** for that segment below the frontmatter, preserving timestamps and speaker labels.

### 4. Repeat

Continue until the entire episode is chunked. Each chunk should be a separate file.

## Best Practices

- **Be consistent**: Use the same metadata fields and formatting as in previous episodes.
- **Be descriptive**: Write clear, concise summaries and titles.
- **Be thorough**: Include all relevant metadata to maximize searchability and usefulness in a knowledge base.
- **Preserve verbatim**: Do not edit the transcript text except for minor formatting (e.g., fixing obvious typos).

---

## Why Chunk?

- **Improved search**: Smaller, topic-focused segments are easier to search and retrieve.
- **Knowledge base ready**: Chunks can be indexed, summarized, or embedded for LLMs.
- **Reusability**: Chunks can be referenced independently in other projects or tools.
