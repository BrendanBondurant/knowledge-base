Stefan

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an episode of The Good Thing, episode one, where we're...

## Chunking Instructions

### 1. Read the Full Transcript
Open the relevant `epXX-full.md` file. Read through the transcript and identify natural breakpoints—topic changes, new stories, or significant shifts in the conversation.

### 2. Define Chunks
- Each chunk should be coherent and self-contained (usually 2–8 minutes of audio, but use your judgment)
- Chunks should not be too short (avoid splitting every speaker turn) or too long (avoid 10+ minute blocks)

### 3. Create Chunk Files
For each chunk:

1. Create a new file in the appropriate episode directory (e.g., `ep04/ep04-01-topic-title.md`)

2. Add YAML frontmatter at the top, including:
   - `title`: Short, descriptive title for the chunk
   - `slug`: Unique identifier (e.g., `ep04-01-topic-title`)
   - `series`: Always "The Good Thing"
   - `episode`: Episode number
   - `chunk`: Chunk number (sequential, starting from 1)
   - `segment`: Short description of the segment
   - `timecode`, `start_time`, `end_time`: Use transcript timestamps
   - `speakers`: List of speakers in the chunk
   - `topics`: Bullet list of main topics discussed (Title Case, human-readable)
   - `tags`: Short, machine-friendly tags (lowercase, kebab-case) from `tags_master.yaml`
   - `entities`: People, companies, or products mentioned
   - `summary`: 1–3 sentence summary of the chunk (in plain English)

3. Paste the transcript for that segment below the frontmatter, preserving timestamps and speaker labels

### 4. Repeat
Continue until the entire episode is chunked. Each chunk should be a separate file.

## Metadata Field Rules (Detailed)

### Topics
**Purpose:** Human-readable description of discussion themes in the chunk.

**Format:**
- Title Case (e.g., GraphQL Federation, Wedding Preparation)
- Spaces between words; no hyphens or underscores
- 1–4 words preferred; avoid overly specific one-off phrasing unless essential

**Usage:** Used for browsing and human-facing displays.

### Tags
**Purpose:** Global, machine-friendly vocabulary for categorizing all content.

**Format:**
- Lowercase only
- Kebab-case: words separated by hyphens
- No special characters except hyphens
- Must be broad enough for reuse across multiple files

**Usage:** Pulled from `tags_master.yaml`.

## Why Chunk?

- **Improved search:** Smaller, topic-focused segments are easier to search and retrieve
- **Knowledge base ready:** Chunks can be indexed, summarized, or embedded for LLMs
- **Reusability:** Chunks can be referenced independently in other projects or tools
