| 00:00:24 | 00:03:39 | Stefan opens the episode by addressing rumors that WunderGraph is moving away from Federation. He and Jens discuss founder passion, industry chatter after GraphQL Conf, and set the stage for clarifying their direction.                 | graphql, federation, startup, founder, authenticity                        | ep30-01-founder-passion-federation-rumors       |
| 00:03:39 | 00:07:47 | Jens refutes claims that WunderGraph is leaving Federation, detailing their ongoing work, open-source efforts, and partnership with eBay as both investor and collaborator. He frames Apollo’s behavior as resistance to open competition. | graphql, federation, open-source, cosmo, apollo-graphql, competition, eBay | ep30-02-setting-record-straight-federation-ebay |
| 00:07:47 | 00:09:31 | Jens explains real-world problems in Apollo Federation revealed through eBay collaboration, including authorization loopholes in `@requires` and compliance risks in subgraph communication.                                               | federation, graphql, apollo-graphql, compliance, security, openfed, cosmo  | ep30-03-federation-compliance-loopholes-ebay    |
| 00:09:31 | 00:11:50 | Jens introduces semantic non-null handling and directives like `@requiresFetchReasons`, highlighting how Cosmo’s Federation model improves safety and error handling between subgraphs.                                                    | graphql, federation, cosmo, directives, compliance, graphql-federation     | ep30-04-semantic-nonnull-fetch-reasons          |
| 00:11:50 | 00:13:28 | Jens describes why WunderGraph skipped GraphQL Conf to focus on major product releases and scaling the team. He teases three upcoming Cosmo products built fully around Federation.                                                        | cosmo, federation, graphql, roadmap, startup                               | ep30-05-roadmap-focus-federation-products       |
| 00:13:28 | 00:17:42 | Stefan introduces MCP and AI as key discussion points. Jens shares the early development of Cosmo’s MCP implementation, its real-world use, and his skepticism toward current AI hype without solid architecture.                          | ai, mcp, graphql, federation, cosmo, startup                               | ep30-06-ai-mcp-overview-federation-context      |
| 00:17:42 | 00:20:25 | Jens explores how MCP interacts with large graphs, schema documentation quality, and query generation. He stresses schema clarity and governance as prerequisites for meaningful AI automation.                                            | ai, graphql, mcp, schema-governance, documentation, federation             | ep30-07-mcp-graph-challenges-schema-quality     |
| 00:20:25 | 00:23:22 | Jens defines the “entity layer” as a core architectural idea beyond Federation—an abstraction that connects data models, caching, and identity resolution across systems.                                                                  | graphql, federation, cosmo, entity-layer, architecture, microservices      | ep30-08-entity-layer-concept-federation-core    |
| 00:23:22 | 00:26:26 | He explains how Cosmo Connect replaces GraphQL backends with gRPC-generated code for subgraphs, removing the need for manual data loading and improving backend performance.                                                               | cosmo, grpc, federation, graphql, go, performance                          | ep30-09-cosmo-connect-data-loading-grpc         |
| 00:26:26 | 00:30:15 | Jens elaborates on the entity layer’s caching and streaming capabilities through EDFS, linking entities to event-driven architectures for real-time federation updates.                                                                    | cosmo, edfs, graphql, federation, caching, kafka, streaming                | ep30-10-entity-layer-edfs-event-driven          |
| 00:30:15 | 00:37:47 | They clarify misconceptions that Cosmo is pivoting to gRPC, explaining that it’s an evolution: GraphQL on the frontend, gRPC on the backend, preserving interoperability while improving performance and extensibility.                    | cosmo, grpc, graphql, federation, connect, architecture, performance       | ep30-11-grpc-federation-evolution-cosmo-connect |
| 00:37:47 | 00:42:51 | Jens explains why gRPC makes Federation AI-friendly: LLMs can easily generate gRPC handlers, unlike Apollo Connectors. Cosmo Connect was intentionally designed for LLM-assisted subgraph integration.                                     | ai, grpc, cosmo-connect, federation, graphql, llm, automation              | ep30-12-ai-llm-integration-grpc-subgraphs       |
| 00:42:52 | 00:47:23 | The hosts react to Apollo Summit announcements. Jens finds most updates incremental, discussing APM templates, Kubernetes operators, and differences in execution versus marketing.                                                        | apollo-graphql, graphql, federation, observability, kubernetes, marketing  | ep30-13-apollo-summit-recap-analysis            |
| 00:47:23 | 00:50:44 | Jens compares Apollo’s marketing-driven feature rollouts with Cosmo’s engineering-first culture. He emphasizes open relationships with customers and technical depth over hype.                                                            | apollo-graphql, graphql, federation, engineering, startup, culture         | ep30-14-engineering-focus-vs-marketing          |
| 00:50:44 | 00:51:54 | Stefan and Jens announce hiring across engineering, marketing, and sales, emphasizing ownership and collaboration within the growing WunderGraph team.                                                                                     | startup, hiring, engineering, marketing, sales, wundergraph                | ep30-15-hiring-growth-wundergraph-team          |
| 00:51:54 | 00:56:31 | Stefan reflects on AI trends, comparing today’s boom to the early internet era. He predicts most AI startups will fail but affirms that AI will transform developer workflows and everyday tasks.                                          | ai, startups, history, developer-tools, llm                                | ep30-16-ai-trends-dotcom-parallels              |
| 00:56:31 | 00:59:19 | Stefan describes AI’s impact on API creation and developer productivity, while highlighting WunderGraph’s advantage in combining API collaboration with AI-driven schema management.                                                       | ai, api, productivity, collaboration, graphql, federation, governance      | ep30-17-ai-api-collaboration-future             |
| 00:59:19 | 01:02:28 | Jens expands on long-term AI integration, emphasizing vertical application of AI for API governance and collaboration. He calls Federation the stable backbone for future AI-driven workflows.                                             | ai, graphql, federation, api-governance, collaboration, enterprise         | ep30-18-ai-vertical-integration-federation      |
| 01:02:28 | 01:03:11 | Jens closes with excitement for 2026 plans—more conferences, collaboration tooling, and a long-term commitment to improving Federation and API design.                                                                                     | graphql, federation, collaboration, roadmap, startup                       | ep30-19-outlook-federation-future               |
