Jens
Okay, cool. Yeah. Before we go to the Q&A, I want to finish my slides. Am I sharing again? Yes.
Okay, perfect. So, what did I have here? So live demo, then? Documentation. Cosmo docs, if
you want to learn more cosmo docs/connect. Then, deploying your first, router plugin, customer
docs slash tutorial.
00:45:39:24 - 00:46:05:01
Jens
You can also just search for the tutorial, but we have an end to end tutorial where you can go
through or through all the steps, and try it out yourself. And maybe you want to, schedule a live
session. I know the URL says contact sales. But it's it's actually more like, yeah. Just connect
with us, talk to us, and, we can schedule a live session and, talk more about use cases and
everything.
00:46:05:03 - 00:46:29:08
Jens
And then, one more announcement. So, you you might know me from, the Friday sessions,
typically with Stefan, who's currently on, vacation. So this Friday, same time as always, we do
our podcast. We invite Dustin. Jesse and Ludwig. I don't know if Jesse and Ludwig, if you if you
want to come, you can come.
00:46:29:10 - 00:46:58:15
Jens
Yeah. And, again, we will we will talk about, cosmo connect in a little bit more. Relaxed, format.
We have more time. We talk about, like, the, the behind the scenes, how we actually build it,
why we build it, and we can talk much more about, like, log file, and, it's actually not, like, super
trivial to translate, GraphQL to gRPC, because there is some slight differences between the two.
00:46:58:17 - 00:47:01:15
Jens
Ludwig is confirming. So yeah.
00:47:01:18 - 00:47:03:10
Ludwig
Especially this.
00:47:03:12 - 00:47:27:23
Jens
Join us this Friday. It's going to be, amazing. And yeah, that's my slideshow. And then, I know
we have, a couple of questions already. So maybe I don't know, Jesse, you you are hands on
with, with the chat. And we can also look into the answered questions, because maybe we can
just pick it up for the conversation, for the benefit of everybody.
